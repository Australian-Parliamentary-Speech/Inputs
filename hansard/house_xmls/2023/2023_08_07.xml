              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition draws to the attention of the House the inefficiency of overhead powerlines and how power outages are increasing in number and severity due to ageing electricity grids. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Outages, particularly those related to natural disasters, are almost always accompanied by intersecting events that result in economic, social, environmental and health damages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are also many examples where overhead powerlines have caused a natural disaster in Victoria and indeed, Australia, causing subsequent power outages, often for extended periods of time and impacting our communities negatively. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Outages are not inevitable and make us vulnerable, depending on the frequency, duration, timing, and location. Underground power cables are sustainable, reliable, and visually inconspicuous. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to ensure that all new cabling in rural and regional areas is installed underground as the default and commit to a program of undergrounding current powerlines with priority given to areas designated as bushfire-prone areas. We also ask that the House commits to a program taking into consideration the contribution of underground cables in mitigating power outages during natural disasters. Consideration must be given to the cost of these supply interruptions for both business and community members. We ask the House to also take into consideration the effect of overhead lines and protect our natural environment for our wildlife and their habitats, and the landscape, including impacts on tourism, liveability, and land values.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We thank you for the Standing Committee's correspondence concerning Petition EN2461 on the legalisation of cryptocurrencies. The former Chair's correspondence to the Hon Jane Hume has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 22 August 2022, the Government announced its plan for crypto asset reforms in a media release which can be found on the Treasury website under 'Media Releases'. On 3 February 2023, Treasury released a consultation paper on its token mapping exercise, which can be found on the consultations section of the Treasury website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The consultation paper explores the legal and regulatory status of the crypto ecosystem in detail. The responses to the consultation paper will inform the Government on the elements of the crypto ecosystem that require additional legal and regulatory attention. The reforms resulting from the token mapping exercise will aim to provide legal and regulatory clarity for crypto service providers and ensure additional safeguards for Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the release of the token mapping consultation paper, the Government has been working with Treasury on a custody and licensing framework for crypto service providers. A proposed licensing and custody framework will be subject to a period of public consultation later this year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am writing in relation to correspondence of 21 October 2021 to the former Special Minister of State, the Hon Ben Morton, regarding a petition for the House of Representatives to introduce and approve a bill to cap the income earned by politicians in line with government COVID disaster payments (EN2964). This matter has recently been referred to me to respond.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The pay and allowances for Senators and Members of Parliament are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal (Tribunal), and not by parliamentarians or the Australian Government. The Tribunal is a statutory body and is independent and separate from the Australian Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the matters raised in the petition regarding pay for parliamentarians are for the consideration of the Tribunal, I can advise that the then Government wrote to the Tribunal to request a pause of any pay increases for all senior office holders in its jurisdiction, including parliamentarians, due to the COVID-19 crisis. The Tribunal considered this request when implementing a pause in its determination in 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, the Tribunal released a statement about its 2021 review of remuneration for holders of public office. In the statement, the Tribunal advised that it decided to make no increases in remuneration for public offices in its jurisdiction, including members of Parliament, from 1 July 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Tribunal's obligations, under subsections 7(3) and 8(1)(b) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973</span> and sections 14 and 45 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Business Resources Act 2017</span>, are to make determinations in respect of remuneration for various offices within its jurisdiction, including parliamentarians, at periods of not more than one year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In considering whether any adjustment should occur, the Tribunal takes account of economic conditions in Australia, past and projected movements in remuneration in the public and private sectors (including the Australian Public Service), as well as outcomes of reviews of public offices completed by the Tribunal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with previous decisions, the Tribunal maintains the view that the pay of parliamentarians should increase relative to that of the pay of other public office holders, and thus the decision to determine no annual adjustment for the office holders in the Tribunal's jurisdiction applied to parliamentarians for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial periods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2022, the Tribunal decided to increase remuneration by 2.75 per cent for public offices in its jurisdiction from 1 July 2022. All annual reviews conducted by the Tribunal are publicly available and, in particular, the 2020, 2021 and 2022 Review of Remuneration for Holders of Public Office Statements, which includes parliamentarians, can be found on its website at: www.remtribunal.gov au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises concerns about the voter identification provisions proposed under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Electoral Legislation Amendment: (Voter integrity) Bill 2021</span> (the Bill). The Government opposed the Bill when in opposition and the Bill lapsed at dissolution of the previous Parliament on 11 April 2022. In his second reading speech opposing that Bill, the now Prime Minister, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, stated that the bill would, "make it harder for Australians to cast their votes".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This Government will continue to oppose voter identification should a similar Bill be brought before the Parliament. The former Government's proposal would have seen Australians without valid identification turned away at the ballot box, voting taking much longer for individuals on the day, and our democracy weakened. There was, and remains, no compelling reason to establish these voter identification laws in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is instead committed to removing barriers to participation in democratic processes for all Australians and pursing reforms that make our electoral system fairer, not more inaccessible. This Government follows the legacy of former Labor governments, which have led federal electoral reform in Australian delivering more transparency and accountability. Reforms by the Hawke Labor Government in the 1980s provided the framework for Australia's contemporary elections and our democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Notably, the Hawke Government transformed our democratic institutions with the creation of the independent Australian Electoral Commission to conduct and oversee elections. It also increased transparency by introducing a regime for regulating and disclosing political donations and electoral expenditure. Later, the Gillard Labor Government delivered the direct enrolment program, which continues today using data to help maintain the electoral roll by bringing more Australians onto the electoral roll and updating enrolment details.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our Government believes a strong democracy depends on all citizens being able to participate equally and we must work to ensure voting is accessible to all through access to enrolment. Earlier this year I approved regulatory changes to increase access to enrolment for eligible Australians. This change expanded the forms of identification a voter can use to enrol or update their enrolment to include Medicare and Australian citizenship notice numbers. This will further support those citizens who previously faced barriers to enrolment because they did not have an Australian driver's license or passport to participate in elections and referendums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government continues to work to further strengthen our electoral system. To this end, I have asked the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to initiate an inquiry into the 2022 Federal Election. Amongst other significant issues for investigation, I requested that part of the Committee's considerations include ways to encourage increased electoral participation and support enfranchisement generally. I look forward to receiving the Committee's recommendations and its progress can be followed here: www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Electoral_Matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of this Government's commitment to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a referendum will be held between October and December 2023 to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Within my responsibilities for electoral matters, I have already ensured the referendum machinery legislation is up-to-date, so that the referendum reflects contemporary electoral practises, including donation reporting and the same bans on foreign donations and foreign campaigners that apply during federal elections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our Government will continue to work towards an electoral system that ensures fairness, equity of access and transparency. Thank you for bringing the matters referred to in the petition to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 14 January 2022, your predecessor, Mr Ken O'Dowd, referred petition EN3735 about voting rights of New Zealand citizens and permanent residents to the former Special Minister of State, the Hon. Ben Morton. As this was not responded to during the term of the former Government, I am responding as the current Special Minister of State.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Labor Party has led legislation for significant federal electoral reform in Australia. Reforms by the Hawke Government in the 1980s provided the framework for Australia's contemporary elections and our democracy. Importantly, that Government transformed our democratic institutions with the creation of the independent Australian Electoral Commission to conduct and oversee elections. It also increased transparency in our democratic system by introducing a regime for the regulation and disclosure of political donations and electoral expenditure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Labor continued to deliver electoral reform through the direct enrolment update program, introduced by the Gillard Government. More recently, from opposition we successfully linked public election funding to campaign expenditure, preventing parties from profiting from the electoral system, and forced the Liberal/National Government to ban foreign political donations, protecting our democracy from foreign interference. Already in this term, I have approved regulatory change to expand the forms of identification a voter can use to enrol or update their enrolment to include Medicare numbers and Australian citizenship notice numbers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government continues to work to further reform our electoral system and democratic institutions. As part of our commitment to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a referendum will be held between October and December 2023 to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition requests a review into voting rights, particularly for New Zealand citizens and permanent residents who have resided in Australia for five years or more. Last year, the Prime Minister, the Hon. Anthony Albanese MP, considered the issue of voting rights for New Zealanders in Australia. At the time the Prime Minister confirmed that as part of the usual parliamentary committee review after a federal election in Australia, our Government would ask the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to consider the voting rights of New Zealand people who are here in Australia contributing to our society.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following this, when I wrote to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to initiate inquiry into the 2022 federal election, I asked the Committee to inquire into increasing electoral participation and enfranchisement generally, and specifically in relation to New Zealand citizens residing in Australia and Australian permanent residents and new Australian citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Historically, legislative changes to Australia's electoral system have occurred based on bi-partisan inquiries by this parliamentary committee. I now await the Committee's report, which will provide its investigations into this issue and, I expect, the members' recommendation on whether this is, or is not, an appropriate reform. I encourage the petitioner and interested parties to follow the work of the Committee and submissions made to it, which can be found here: www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Electoral_Matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is also relevant to note progress our Labor Government has made in addressing citizenship processing times. The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Andrew Giles MP, recently announced that in our first year, the Albanese Government has reduced citizenship processing times by 42 <span style="font-style:italic;">per cent</span> to an average of seven months. This progress will support those New Zealanders who successfully apply for Australian citizenship to seek access to enfranchisement in Australia sooner.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition EN4108 requesting that the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) review its decision to not recognise the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for people aged over 60 years. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA, part of the Department of Health and Aged Care, played an important role in conducting assessments of information regarding COVID-19 vaccines that were being used globally for the purpose of international travel. The information from the TGA's assessments was used to inform decisions at Australia's international border with respect to incoming travellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based on an initial assessment of data, the TGA recognised the Sinopharm vaccine for the purpose of inbound travel to Australia for people under 60 years of age in November 2021 due to the lower absolute risk of severe infection/hospitalisation in younger people. The TGA continued to monitor the scientific literature, including the results of real-world evidence and ongoing trials assessing the effectiveness of the Sinopharm vaccine, and amended its initial decision and removed the age limit on 10 May 2022. This decision meant that the Sinopharm vaccine was recognised for all ages for the purpose of inbound travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, since 6 July 2022 people are now able to travel to and from Australia without being required to declare their COVID-19 vaccine status.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding petition number EN4118, relating to application of the Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS) on households. I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The MLS was introduced in 1997 to encourage higher income earners and higher income households, with a greater capacity to pay, to purchase Australian private hospital insurance and where possible, use the private hospital system to reduce demand on the public system, Medicare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this regard, the MLS makes an important contribution to supporting access to public health care for those Australians whose personal circumstances are such that they may not be able to afford to purchase private health insurance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note income thresholds protect lower earning households from paying the MLS, even in the instance no family member has purchased private hospital insurance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Indexation of the income tiers which determine application of the MLS recommenced on 1 July 2023, after having been held at 2014-15 levels. This means fewer people are now subject to the MLS. Further information about these changes is available at www.ato.gov.au by searching for 'Medicare Levy Surcharge'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of improving the sustainability, affordability and value of private health insurance, including in the context of the benefits it offers individuals and their families, as well as the Australian health care system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this context, studies into the key private health insurance regulatory settings, including the MLS, were recently completed. The final reports for the studies can be found on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.consultations.health.gov.au by searching for 'private health'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The department is engaging with stakeholders on the studies and is accepting feedback until 15 August 2023. The Government will consider stakeholder feedback with a view to inform potential changes to MLS arrangements.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Health Care</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition EN4139, requesting an amendment to the Distribution Priority Area (DPA) classification for The Redlands, Queensland. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is strongly committed to improving access to health services for all Australians. The Government recognises the unique challenges currently facing the health system and is focused on improving the capacity, quality, and distribution of health services to meet the needs of all communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's ongoing commitment to improving healthcare was reflected in the 2023-24 Budget released on 9 May 2023. The Budget provides an historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare, to lay the foundations for significant reforms. This Budget responds to the recommendations of the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce and takes the key steps needed to address the many pressing challenges in our healthcare system, including the fact that seeing a GP has become harder and more expensive, especially in regional, rural, and remote areas. A Budget overview is available at: www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-05/overview-budget-2023-24_0.pdf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes, $17.5 million committed under the Strengthening Medicare Package—the Supporting Healthcare and Support Services in Thin Markets measure to improve access to health services in environments where the market for health services is thin or failing. As part of this measure, the Government has committed to undertake a stocktake and review of distribution program and policy levers, including the DPA mechanism, to support the development of innovative delivery models to support service access in thin markets and to improve the equitable access to health services in the longer term.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DPA mechanism is used to identify areas of GP shortage throughout Australia, allowing the Government to direct location-restricted doctors into areas of greatest need. DPA status does not guarantee recruitment of a doctor but allows practices to access an expanded pool of doctors from which they may recruit, including Overseas Trained Doctors and Australian-trained Bonded doctors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Redlands encompasses a large geographic area across two GP catchments under the DPA mechanism: Cleveland-Stradbroke and Capalaba. In the most recent DPA annual update on 21 July 2022, both Cleveland-Stradbroke and Capalaba catchments were assessed as being more than 10% above the benchmark for distribution, indicating that these areas benefit from greater GP service access than other comparable areas of Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the DPA system also takes into consideration an area's geographic remoteness under the Modified Monash Model (MMM) classification system, with all areas classified MM 2-7 under the MMM automatically deemed DPA. This means that some areas of the Cleveland-Stradbroke catchment, classified MM2-6 under the MMM, attract DPA status. The remaining MMl areas of Cleveland-Stradbroke and all of Capalaba are classified non-DPA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that occasionally there are circumstances within a GP catchment which are not fully captured in the annual updates. For this reason, there is an exceptional circumstances review process that allows eligible practices to request a review of their catchment's designation as non-DPA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If eligible practices within The Redlands believe there are exceptional circumstances which have not been considered in the annual update, they may apply for a review of their catchment's DPA status. To do this, practices will need to contact their local Rural Workforce Agency (RWA) to submit an application. The RWA for Queensland is Health Workforce Queensland. Health Workforce Queensland can best be contacted on (07) 3105 7800 or via their website at www.healthworkforce.com.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For more information on the DPA exceptional circumstances review, please refer to the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au/health-topics/rural- health-workforce/classifications/dpa/request-review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please note that a change in DPA classification will only allow practices to recruit from a slightly wider GP pool, as doctors would need to be a Fellow (due to MM1 classification) or an international medical graduate with temporary residency status.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Practices can also access additional support to attract and retain GPs into their area from their local Primary Health Network (PHN), the Brisbane South PHN or, if within an MM2-7 area, their RWA, Health Workforce Queensland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Vaccine</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition EN4149 asking the House to make sure that the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) prioritises the provisional approval of Vaxine's COVID-19 vaccine and waives any application fee. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing access to free and effective COVID-19 vaccines to everyone living in Australia who is eligible. To do so, the Government has invested in a diverse portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines that use a variety of technical platforms, securing supply for all eligible populations within Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refute the assertion that Vaxine Pty Ltd did not receive Government-funded grants. As noted in our response to petition EN3620 on 15 August 2022, Vaxine Pty Ltd, the company developing Flinders University's COVID-19 vaccine candidate "COVAX-19(R)", was funded $1 million through the Government's Biomedical Translation Bridge Program, an initiative of the Medical Research Future Fund.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 15 December 2021 the TGA granted a provisional determination to Vaxine Pty Ltd for its COVID-19 vaccine, Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 rS (Vax-S-dTM-W1) (SPIKOGEN VACCINE), which is also known as COVAX-19. In May 2022, the provisional determination for this vaccine candidate was extended. This lapsed on 14 December 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By granting a provisional determination, the TGA made a decision that Vaxine Pty Ltd was eligible to apply for provisional registration for its vaccine on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Provisional determination is the first step in the provisional registration process. Importantly, this does not mean that the sponsor will submit an application or that the TGA will approve the subsequent application. Registration and supply in Australia will only commence should the vaccine be approved as safe and effective by the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Despite receiving provisional determination, the TGA has not received an application from Vaxine Pty Ltd to provisionally register its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I must emphasise that, if the sponsor holds the appropriate evidence, they are welcome to make an application to the TGA to register their vaccine on the ARTG at any time. If an application for a COVID-19 vaccine is received, it will be treated with the greatest priority. However, the Government cannot compel a sponsor to submit an application for registration. Furthermore, in the absence of a formal application, the TGA does not have the legal ability to initiate an evaluation of the product.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Also, as outlined in the response to EN3620, the results of clinical trials conducted overseas, such as those from the Phase Ill clinical trial undertaken by Vaxine Pty Ltd in collaboration with Iranian biotechnology company CinnaGen, can be used to support the sponsor's future application to the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, it is not possible for the TGA to waive the application fee to provisionally register Vaxine's COVID-19 vaccine. Similar to other international regulators, the TGA is required to recover its costs for all activities that fall under the scope of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989</span>. This includes evaluating applications for new vaccines. I can also confirm that sponsors of the COVID-19 vaccines that have been provisionally approved have paid all of the relevant fees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Food Labelling</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding a petition for food serving size on the nutritional label using common measuring units (Petition Number: EN4163). I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The request asks the House of Representatives to make it mandatory for food companies to state the amount of food a serving size is on the nutritional label using common measurements appropriate to the food.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that a nutritious diet is one of the most influential factors contributing to the overall health and wellbeing of all Australians. To assist consumers to make informed food purchases, the Government requires certain mandatory information to be listed on food labels. This includes the serving size information on the Nutrition Information Panel (NIP).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is responsible for the development and regulation of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (Code), and the standards of the Code are enforced by the states and territories. The Code outlines the requirements that are relevant to all foods, including specific labelling and information requirements that apply to certain food products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Standard 1.2.8 of the Code sets out the requirements on what must be included on the NIP. This includes what constitutes as a serving of a particular food, the number of servings in the package and the quantity of food in a serving. This information is listed at the top of the NIP and often includes common measurements appropriate to the particular food, for example 'Serving size: 30g (2/3 metric cup)', or 'Serving size: 23.8g (4 biscuits)'. It is important to note that for products that do not have common consumption measurements, use of serving size information in grams or millilitres is more appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Another important consideration is that serving sizes listed on NIPs are determined by food manufacturers and vary between different foods. A serving size may therefore not be indicative of what an appropriate portion size is for that particular food for different population groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports the Australian Dietary Guidelines (Guidelines) to help consumers make more informed decisions by providing information on the amount and types of foods people require to promote health and wellbeing and reduce the risk of diet-related conditions including obesity and chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Guidelines provide the recommended number of daily serves an individual requires from each of the five food groups. The serve size is a set amount (as outlined in the Guidelines) that does not change, which differs from manufacturer determined serving sizes. The number of serves of each of the five food groups an individual needs to consume each day varies between individually due to factors including gender, weight, height, physical activity level and health conditions. The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating provides helpful visual representations of the proportion of the five food groups recommended for consumption each day.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has invested in a diverse range of COVID-19 treatment options to ensure Australia will have sufficient treatment supply to manage different stages of disease. Evusheld was the first non-vaccine medication secured by the Government for the prevention of COVID-19 in people who are at risk of infection but have not been exposed to the virus. Evusheld is not recommended as a substitute for COVID-19 vaccination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In early January 2023, the Government secured up to an additional 12,000 (300-300mg) doses of Evusheld from AstraZeneca for the National Medical Stockpile (NMS) to continue to support patients with severe immunocompromise. This was in addition to the 36,000 (150-l50mg) doses secured in late 2020 and early 2021. All supplies of Evusheld have been provided to state and territory health departments to distribute within their jurisdiction. Each state and territory is responsible for managing the distribution of Evusheld in accordance with its COVID-19 care arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Evusheld was first provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on 24 February 2022 for the prevention (pre-exposure prophylaxis) of COVID-19 in people with sub-optimal or no protection from COVID-19 vaccines. On 12 December 2022, the TGA amended the conditions of its provisional approval for the use of Evusheld for pre-exposure prophylaxis in individuals 12 years and over, increasing the required dosage regime from 150-l50mg to 300-300mg dose with the option to provide repeat dosing every six months. Evusheld also received provisional approval as a treatment for adults with COVID-19, who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 March 2023, the TGA reported emerging data showed monoclonal antibodies, such as Evusheld, demonstrated a significant decrease in their in-vitro neutralising activities against many newer circulating variants, particularly Omicron subvariants, but noted the regulatory status remained unchanged.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA's full statement is available at www.tga.gov.au/news/news/update-effectiveness-monoclonal-antibodies-against-covid-variants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may also be interested to know that at its 7 December 2022 meeting, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), considered a PBS listing of Evusheld (tixagevimab 150mg with cilgavimab 150mg), for the second time, for pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19 infection in certain individuals. The PBAC again did not recommend the listing of Evusheld on the PBS. Full details of the PBACs outcome is available at www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/pbac-outcomes/recommendations-made-by-the-pbac-december-2022-intracycle.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence regarding petition EN4211 requesting the Australian Government contribute funding to build a new single site hospital to service the Albury Wodonga, northeast Victoria and southern New South Wales regions. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the important contribution the unique cross border arrangements make to servicing the health needs of the Albury Wodonga and surrounding regions. The Government remains committed to working with state and territory governments to improve access to health and hospital services so that all Australians receive appropriate health care when and where they need it, including in regional, rural, and remote areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) sets out the financial and governance arrangements for the funding of public hospital services in Australia. Under the NHRA, the state and territory governments have committed to providing eligible patients with the choice to receive public hospital services free-of-charge, on the basis of clinical need and within a clinically appropriate period. Through the NHRA, the Government makes a significant funding contribution to assist states and territories with the costs of delivering public hospital services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The two local hospital networks responsible for delivering public hospital services in the Albury Wodonga region, the Albury New South Wales Local Health District and Albury Wodonga Health, received a combined $105.3 million in Australian Government Activity Based Funding for public hospitals services in 2021-22. Additionally, in 2021-22, the Government made a block funded contribution of a combined $18.9 million to these two local hospital networks for services such as teaching, training, and research, and those provided by small rural hospitals.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NHRA recognises that states and territories are the system managers of their public hospital systems, responsible for the day-to-day administration of their public hospitals, and for planning and funding the infrastructure necessary to support the delivery of their public hospital services. As such, decisions regarding the establishment of a new single site Albury Wodonga Hospital are a matter for the New South Wales and Victorian Governments.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition number EN4275 requesting extending access to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators such as Trikafta(R) (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor with ivacaftor) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis associated with a broader range of mutations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government currently subsidises four CFTR modulators through the PBS: Trikafta(R), Symdeko(R) (tezacaftor/ivacaftor with ivacaftor), Orkambi(R) (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Kalydeco(R) (ivacaftor).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Trikafta(R) was recently extended on the PBS from 1 May 2023, providing subsidised access for children with cystic fibrosis aged 6 to 11 years, who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), an independent expert advisory body comprising doctors, other health professionals and consumer representatives, makes recommendations to the Government about PBS listings. Under legislation, the Government cannot list a new medicine on the PBS unless the PBAC makes a recommendation in favour of its listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The pharmaceutical company responsible for Trikafta(R), Symdeko(R), Orkambi(R) and Kalydeco(R), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Ltd, has not made an application to the PBAC to extend the listing of these medicines to include a broader range of mutations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia's regulator of medicines and other therapeutic goods, has not approved Trikafta(R) for broader clinical used in Australia. Medicines typically are not listed on the PBS for clinical uses that have not been approved by the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consideration of a medicine for TGA registration and PBS listing is generally initiated by the sponsor making applications to the TGA and PBAC, respectively. Pharmaceutical companies have access to the scientific data and other information necessary to inform the PBAC's consideration.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Health and Aged Care is consulting with the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons and relevant clinical colleges on improving access to Medicare rebates for people who receive gender affirmation treatment as a private patient. This includes consideration of listing various procedures performed in gender affirmation process on the MBS following advice from the Medical Services Advisory Committee.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is responsible for setting Medicare benefits, doctors are able to set their own fees and the actual fee charged is a matter between the doctor and the patient. Medical practitioners are encouraged to consider their patients' personal circumstances when determining the fees they charge, and many do.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 March 2023, the Government announced a pathway to better health and wellbeing for LGBTIQA+ communities. This includes the development of Australia's first 10 Year National Action Plan for the Health and Wellbeing of LGBTIQA+ people (Action Plan) and a $26 million investment in health and medical research focusing on LGBTIQA+ communities under the Medical Research Future Fund.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 regarding petition EN4298 which requests the Australian Government increase funding to the health and hospital system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to improving access to health and hospital services so that all Australians receive appropriate health care when and where they need it, including in regional, rural and remote areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA), all state and territory governments have committed to providing eligible patients with the choice to receive public hospital services free-of-charge, on the basis of clinical need, within a clinically appropriate period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the NHRA, the Government provides a significant funding contribution to assist states and territories with the costs of delivering public hospital services. Under the NHRA, the majority of public hospitals are funded on an activity basis. Activity Based Funding provides funding to public hospitals based on the number and mix of patients they treat. If a hospital treats more patients, it receives more funding. This supports the Government's commitment to ensuring access to health care, when and where people need it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's funding contribution for public hospital services in Australia under the NHRA has grown from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 to $24.1 billion in 2021-22, an increase of 81%. Between 2022-23 and 2026-27, the Government's funding contribution for public hospital services in Australia under the NHRA is estimated to grow from $25.6 billion in 2022-23 to $34.3 billion in 2026-27, an increase of 34%.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NHRA recognises that state and territory governments are the system managers of their public hospital systems, responsible for the day-to-day administration and performance of their public hospitals. This includes decisions on funding over and above the Government contribution under the NHRA, as well as management of staff resources.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Mid-term Review (Review) of the NHRA is currently underway. The Review, which is independently led, is examining whether the NHRA is meeting its stated objectives. The Review is considering whether the NHRA's health planning, funding and governance arrangements are still fit-for-purpose, particularly given emerging priorities for better integrated care and more seamless interfaces between health and primary care, aged care and disability systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It will also examine other matters including the impact of external factors such as COVID-19 on the demand for hospital services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Review is due to be completed by the end of 2023 and will provide advice to all Health Ministers on potential options for future reform and agreements. Health Ministers will then work together to consider the outcomes and recommendations of the Review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition EN4330 asking that Endometriosis be recognised as a disability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has made the health and wellbeing of all women and girls a priority. This includes a commitment to implementing a suite of endometriosis support measures announced in the 2022-23 Budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key component of these measures is the establishment of specialised GP clinics across Australia to provide access to specialised endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain diagnosis, treatment and management, with a focus on improving diagnostic timeliness and to promote early access to intervention, care and treatment options. Information on these specialised endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain clinics can be found on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website www.health.gov.au/our-work/endometriosis-and-pelvic- pain-clinics.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding recognising endometriosis for the purposes of disability support, any person with a disability can access the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) if they meet the requirements set out in <span style="font-style:italic;">the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013</span> (NDIS Act), including age, residency and disability or early intervention requirements. Generally, a person will be eligible for the NDIS if their disability is, or is likely to be, permanent and causes a substantial reduction in their capacity for communication, social interaction, learning, mobility, self-care or self-management.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS does not determine eligibility based solely on types of disability or on the presence of an underlying condition, illness or injury. People with endometriosis can become NDIS participants if they meet the requirements set out in the NDIS Act, including providing evidence of the functional impact of their disability on activities of daily living. However, not all people with endometriosis will meet the access requirements under the NDIS Act. In all cases, any person with disability should test their eligibility for the NDIS with the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and, should they be determined as eligible, the NDIA will provide the person with an individualised package of support that matches their circumstances and goals. A participant's NDIS plan may also include some kinds of health supports where those supports are required because of their disability and form a regular part of the participant's daily life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Access lists were introduced during the transition phase of the Scheme to expedite consideration of access for some cohorts. They do not override the provisions of the NDIS Act and people whose disabilities are not listed, such as people with endometriosis, can still become NDIS participants if they meet the requirements in the Act. Meeting the requirements of the NDIS Act, not having a condition on a list, is what determines eligibility. A participant's NDIS plan may also include some health supports where those supports are required because of the disability and when they form a regular part of the participant's daily life. Further information can be found at www.ndis.gov.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 regarding Petition EN4341—a proposal to extend access to subsidised continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products through the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) to people with type 2 diabetes. I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting Australians with diabetes and their families.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides considerable financial support to people with diabetes through the subsidy of essential medicines, like insulin, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and other diabetes-related products, like blood glucose test strips, through the NDSS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2021-22, PBS expenditure on medicines for diabetes was $804 million and expenditure on products for diabetes supplied through the NDSS was over $196 million.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This follows implementation of a $273.1 million election commitment made by the Government to provide an additional 71,000 people with type 1 diabetes access to subsidised CGM products, with an affordable co-payment equivalent to $32.50 per month.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">National Security</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4379—Reduce the timeframe of all 99 years leases to 18 years. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition EN4379 raises national interest and national security concerns regarding the duration of leases held by foreign investors over Australian property and utilities. While the Commonwealth is responsible for regulating foreign investment, lease arrangements are the responsibility of state and territory governments and regulated by their respective laws and regulations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Australian Government recognises community concerns about foreign ownership of certain Australian assets. That is why the foreign investment review framework allows the Government to take these concerns into consideration, by reviewing foreign investment proposals on a case-by-case basis to ensure they are not contrary to the national interest or national security.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the framework, proposed foreign investments may be screened under a 'national interest test' or a narrower 'national security test'. In assessing a proposal's impact on the national interest, the Government considers: national security; character of the investor; competition; impact on the economy and community; and other Government policies (including tax).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Investments that pose national security concerns—that is, investments in an industry sector critical to Australia's national security—trigger mandatory notification obligations under the foreign investment framework. For example, this might include acquisitions involving or connected with critical infrastructure and services or technologies essential to Australia's defence or intelligence capability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The definition of a 'national security business' under the foreign investment framework includes entities regulated under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018</span> (the SOCI Act). The SOCI Act is the regulatory framework for managing risks relating to Australia's critical infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In assessing these investments, Treasury alongside relevant national security agencies, engages with industry and relevant stakeholders to undertake strategic analysis on sectoral issues relating to foreign investment. This strategic analysis is used to identify emerging national security risks across industries and sectors and makes whole-of-government recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If it is ultimately determined that a proposal would be contrary to the national interest or to national security, it will not be approved, or conditions will be imposed to mitigate risks to our national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign investment plays an important and beneficial role in the Australian economy. It helps drive economic growth, creates skilled jobs, improves access to overseas markets and enhances productivity. Foreign investment has helped build Australia's economy, and it will continue to enhance the wellbeing of Australians by supporting economic growth and innovation into the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Should the petitioner require further information on Australia's foreign investment policy and framework, I have attached Australia's Foreign Investment Policy and Guidance Note 8: National Security. Further details, including Guidance Notes on other aspects of the framework, can be found at www.firb.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition number EN4383 (with 6,687 signatures), about medicinal cannabis cost issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware many Australians are experiencing difficulties with the cost of medicinal cannabis, and patients are reporting benefits since commencing the medicine, including being able to transition from opioids or 'alternative sources' of cannabis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicinal cannabis products are regulated as medicines in Australia. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), as Australia's regulator of medicines, currently provides safe and legal access to medicinal cannabis in appropriate circumstances, Generally, medicines used in Australia must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG), which is administered by the TGA. Sativex(R) (nabiximols) and Epidyolex (cannabidiol) are the only approved medicinal cannabis products included in the ARTG, approved under the standard and priority pathways, respectively.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sativex(R) was approved by TGA in 2012 (ARTG 181978) for moderate to severe multiple sclerosis, but is not currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Epidyolex(R) was approved by TGA in 2020 (ARTG 328860) for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. In May 2021, Epidyolex(R) was listed on the PBS for Dravet syndrome (severe epilepsy in infancy). In June 2023 it was also PBS listed for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (another severe form of epilepsy that begins in early childhood). For a medicine to be listed on the PBS, it usually has to be registered by the TGA. The TGA would consider any future applications for medicinal cannabis products, where data was provided on quality, safety and efficacy. The Australian Government is unable to compel a pharmaceutical company to submit applications for ARTG registration of a medicine, and the TGA cannot evaluate a medicine without an application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBS is the main mechanism through which the Government subsidises the cost of medicines for Australian patients. Under legislation, the Government can only list a medicine on the PBS when the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommends a listing. The PBAC is an independent and expert body, comprising doctors, health professionals, health economists and consumer representatives. Its primary role is to advise me, as Minister for Health and Aged Care, about medicines that should be PBS-subsidised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When the PBAC evaluates applications for PBS subsidy, it is legally required to consider effectiveness and cost of the medicine, compared to alternative treatments. There is no legal provision for subsidised supply of a non-PBS-listed medicine, or for a PBS-listed medicine outside the terms of its listing (or specific restrictions). No exceptions are permitted for individual patients, even in particular cases where the medicine might be beneficial or recommended on clinical grounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, most medicinal cannabis products are 'unapproved', but the TGA can approve any medical practitioner to prescribe an unapproved medicinal cannabis product for an individual patient, through the Special Access B Scheme. In addition, under the Authorised Prescriber Scheme, a suitably authorised doctor can prescribe products without obtaining patient-by-patient approvals from TGA. A number of companies are conducting clinical trials with the intent of lodging applications with TGA in the coming year. The TGA welcomes and encourages discussions with prospective companies about the regulatory process for medicinal cannabis products. Similarly, the PBAC's consideration (for subsequent PBS listing) is generally initiated when the pharmaceutical company applies for PBS listing, as companies usually hold scientific data and other information necessary to inform the PBAC's consideration. A pharmaceutical company is a private entity that makes its own decisions about availability of its medicines, pricing of its medicines in the private market and whether it will apply for PBS subsidy. The Government cannot compel companies to submit applications for PBS listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Patients and treating doctors can contact companies responsible for 'approved' and 'unapproved' medicinal cannabis products, to ask if they are considering submitting applications for particular medical conditions. The Office of Drug Control publishes a comprehensive list (and contact details) of Australian medicinal cannabis manufacturers and suppliers, licensed under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narcotic Drugs Act 1967</span>, available at www.odc.gov.au/manufacturers-and-suppliers-medicinal-cannabis-products. While speaking with any company, patients or their treating doctors can ask if access to the medicine is available at reduced cost, through a compassionate or expanded access program. Decisions about these programs are a matter for each company.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Treating doctors can consider applying (on a patient's behalf) to the drug and therapeutics committee of the local public hospital to seek assistance with cost. Some states and territories are subsidising the cost for some patients through access programs or clinical trials. Private health insurers are free to pay benefits under general treatment cover for the full price of a medicine, noting this is a commercial decision for each health insurer. Medicines not PBS-listed are dispensed as private prescriptions, and patient charges for private prescriptions are a matter for each pharmacy. Price competition applies to products not available on the PBS and patients can speak to their pharmacist about prices, including if they find a cheaper price elsewhere.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All aspects of patient care, including recommendations about appropriate treatments (or access to relevant clinical trials), are the responsibility of a patient's treating doctor.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 regarding Petition EN4385 seeking lower fees for general dental services and dental procedures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The private sector in Australia primarily employs 85% of dental practitioners, and accounts for around 80% of dental visits. I understand the petitioners' concern relates to the fees private dental practitioners may charge for services. The Australian Government does not have authority to determine the fees charged by private dental practitioners in their private practice. Dental practitioners operating as private businesses are free to place their own value on the services they provide.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary responsibility for public dental services including funding, management of waiting lists and determining what services they provide. The Government is aware of the barriers to accessing affordable dental services and supports a range of targeted programs for children and adult concession card holders to access care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 Budget, the Government announced funding for states and territories of $215.6 million over two years in the Federation Funding Agreement. This will provide services to an additional 360,000 public dental patients while the Government and states and territories negotiate long-term funding arrangements for public dental services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the NHRA, the state and territory governments have committed to providing eligible patients public hospital services free-of-charge, with priority determined based on clinical need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Government funds the Child Dental Benefits Scheme (CDBS). The CDBS is a means tested program that provides eligible children up to $1052 in benefits over a two-calendar year period. Since the CDBS program commenced on 1 January 2014, it has provided $2.9 billion in benefits for 48 million services to 3.4 million eligible Australian children. Under the program, over 95% of services are bulk billed with no out-of-pocket for patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to work with states and territories on ways of improving access to dental services for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Health Ministers have made dental policy reform a priority and are considering funding reform options. This reform work is being supported by a National Dental Reform Oversight Group (Oversight Group), as established by the Health Chief Executives' Forum. The Oversight Group is considering options for consideration by governments regarding sustainable, longer-term funding arrangements that better meet community needs.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding a petition for funding for drug and alcohol program at the Murray Mallee General Practice Network (Petition Number: EN4399). I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to reducing the impacts of drug and alcohol use on individuals, families and communities through the Drug and Alcohol Program. This includes an investment of more than $870 million over four years (from 1 July 2022) to support drug and alcohol treatment services and prevention, research and communication.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Funding of up to $27.9 million (GST exclusive) over two years (2022-23 to 2023-24) has been committed to targeted alcohol and other drug treatment services in identified areas of need. As part of this funding, $1.04 million (GST exclusive) has been committed to continue to provide drug and alcohol treatment to support the community in the Murray Mallee region of South Australia, through the Murray Mallee General Practice Network.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding Petition EN4410 requesting to amend eligibility criteria for the Rural Locum Assistance Program (RLAP). I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Petition seeks changes to allow consideration of extenuating circumstances for placements that would enable pharmacies to remain open where they might otherwise close.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">RLAP specifically provides locums to backfill for an employed health professional while they are absent on professional development training or on leave. This supports retention of the rural workforce and a pharmacy owner can request the assistance of RLAP while they take Continuing Professional Development or annual leave. The program is not a source of locums to cover workforce vacancies. There are, however, a number of private agencies that may be able to provide locums for this purpose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Australian Government recognises the pressures of health workforce vacancies on services access in rural areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is determined to improve access to healthcare for all Australians and recognises the barriers people in rural and remote Australia face in accessing care. The 2023-24 Budget delivers critical funding for urgent needs and lays the foundations for longer-term reform. More information on the 2023-24 Budget is available on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Alternatively, pharmacies facing workforce pressures can seek support funded by the Government. Rural Workforce Agencies (RWAs) in each state and the Northern Territory, under the Rural Health Workforce Support Activity deliver a range of activities aimed at improving the access, quality, and sustainability of the regional, rural, and remote health workforce. RWAs can support the recruitment of health workforce into vacancies, and contact details for each jurisdiction can be found of the department's website by searching 'Rural Health Workforce Support Activity'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are also funded by the Government to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health services for people and increasing access and quality support for people. Part of this includes working closely with providers to build health workforce capacity. Contact details for pharmacies seeking support from their local PHN may be found on the department's website by searching 'Primary Health Network (PHN) locator map'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler, regarding petition EN4420 which seeks to initiate plasma exchange clinics to provide life-saving therapies and research for those living with dementia. This matter has been referred to me as the Minister for Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the significant and increasing impact dementia has on our community as the second leading cause of death and disease burden in Australia. In response to this, the Government, along with state and territory governments, are working together to develop a 10-year joint National Dementia Action Plan (Action Plan) to put people living with dementia, their families, and carers at the centre of action on dementia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Action Plan has a vision where Australians understand dementia—people living with dementia and their carers have the best quality of life possible. The Action Plan will include broad objectives to support this vision, including timely diagnosis, early intervention support and post-diagnostic support for people living with dementia, their families and carers. The Action Plan will also consider the need for ongoing research into dementia to improve treatment, care and quality of life for people living with dementia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The public consultation for the Action Plan was highly successful with more than 1000 submissions received, with work underway to ensure that the final Action Plan reflects the diverse needs, experiences and requirements of people impacted by dementia. These actions will build on the existing work underway by the Government to support people in accessing timely and accessible services and supports.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding a petition for updating the laws for packaged food labelling (Petition number: EN4423). I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The request asks the House of Representatives to put forward laws that require food manufacturers to label packaged foods as suitable or not suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is the independent statutory authority responsible for the development and maintenance of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (Code) which sets out the legal requirements for food produced or imported for sale in Australia and New Zealand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code requires labels of foods for sale in Australia to contain ingredient lists and a Nutrition Information Panel. There is currently no requirement for vegetarian or vegan labelling because the standards in the Code are primarily aimed at protecting public health and safety, for example requiring declaration of allergens. When making decisions about the information to be provided on a food label, the Food Regulation System has endorsed a food labelling hierarchy as part of the Policy Guideline on Food Labelling to Support Consumers to Make Informed Healthy Food Choices (2020). The food labelling hierarchy gives first priority to information related to food safety, followed by information regarding preventive health and consumer values issues as a third priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Even though the Code does not require vegan or vegetarian labelling, food manufacturers can choose to voluntarily provide information about the vegan and vegetarian status of foods on food labels. These types of representations are subject to relevant consumer laws in Australia, which prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct and false or misleading representations about a food offered for sale.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding food additives, the Code requires ingredients, including food additives, to be declared in the statement of ingredients on the label of most packaged foods (with some exemptions). Food additives are required to be identified by their class name (e.g. 'colour') followed by the name of the food additive or the food additive number. The food additive numbers are based on an international system, set out in the Codex General Standard for Food Additives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A full list of food additive names and code numbers is available on the FSANZ website at: www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/labelling/Pages/Labelling-of-food-additives.aspx. Food additives are the only ingredients that can be listed using a numerical code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Food Labelling</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 November 2023 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding petition number EN4459. I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioner requests that the House of Representatives investigate and ban all wording such as 'meat' from vegan products, noting that these can be misleading to consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian food and consumer laws are designed to provide consumers with the information they need to make an informed choice. It is unlawful for a business to make a representation that is false or misleading.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Food Standards Australia New Zealand is the independent statutory authority responsible for the development and maintenance of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (Code). The Code sets out the legal requirements for food produced or imported for sale in Australia and New Zealand. The Code requires the name of a food to be a name or description that is sufficient to indicate the true nature of the food (Standard 1.2.2, section 2). The Code also allows for the use of a food name with additional descriptors (Standard 1.1.1, subsection 13(4)). For example, the descriptor 'soy' for soy sausage makes it clear to the consumer that the food they are purchasing is not a sausage made from meat.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code also requires ingredient information and a nutrition information panel on most packaged foods to assist consumers make an informed choice about the food they are purchasing and how it compares with other products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is enforced by the independent statutory authority, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), as well as state and territory consumer protection agencies under a 'one law, multiple regulator' model. Amongst other things, the ACL prohibits businesses from engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, or from making a representation that is false or misleading about the quality, quantity, composition or origin of food products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whether the labelling of a plant-based substitute product may be misleading under the ACL depends on the overall impression conveyed to a reasonable consumer by the labelling and packaging. Any such consideration takes into account matters such as specific statements made and images used and their relative prominence, placement and size, and does not hinge on the use of any particular word (such as 'meat') or any particular image.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC has previously considered the labelling of some plant-based substitute products when these issues have been raised with them. In each case the ACCC considered that a court would view the overall impression conveyed by the labelling of these products as unlikely to mislead an ordinary consumer. At most, it may create a sense of confusion, which the courts have found not to breach the ACL.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone can make a report to the ACCC, or their local state or territory consumer protection agency, about a specific product or advertisement they consider is misleading. The ACCC uses information received from reports from the public, as well as other sources of intelligence, to inform its enforcement and compliance work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC undertakes its compliance and enforcement work pursuant to its Compliance and Enforcement Policy. As an economy-wide regulator, the ACCC focuses on issues that have the potential to seriously harm the competitive process or result in widespread consumer or business detriment. Where an issue or conduct is more localised (such as conduct engaged in by a business that only operates in a single state or territory), it is more appropriate to report these to the local state or territory consumer protection agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals also have a private right of action under the ACL and can apply to a court to seek damages against a business, if they consider they have been affected by the business engaging in alleged misleading or deceptive conduct.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition requests an investigation of labelling systems for these meat-alternative products. The petitioner may be aware that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee undertook an inquiry into the definitions of meat and other animal products in Australia. Their report, tabled in February 2022, includes a number of recommendations that relate to the labelling of plant-based meat alternatives. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is currently working with other agencies to finalise the Australian Government response to the inquiry. Both the report, and the Government response once available, can be viewed at www.aph.gov.au by searching 'definitions of meat'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can advise that labelling of plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy products has also been examined through the joint Australia-New Zealand Food Regulatory System. In 2019, the then Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation considered work on misleading descriptions for food. Ministers agreed that plant-based foods mimicking animal-based foods are adequately regulated under the current labelling requirements and consumer and fair-trading laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Earlier work through the Food Regulatory System in 2016 considered dairy substitute beverages, which included consideration of the use of the word 'milk' for these products. Ministers similarly agreed at that time that these beverages are adequately regulated by current permissions in the Food Standards Code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government strongly affirms the importance of clear food labelling. In May 2022, the Government made an election commitment to improve existing regulations to deliver accurate and clear food labelling for products so that consumers can make informed choices. The Government will consider the views of all sectors and the effectiveness of existing regulations as it takes this work forward.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 November 2022 to the Minister for Health and Aged care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding petition EN4477 requesting the waiver of any consultation for the implementation of the Dialysis Treatment Buses in Far West New South Wales (NSW) measure announced in the October 2022-23 Budget. I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the importance of improved and timely access to dialysis treatments in regional and remote areas of the country. This measure will help to reduce the distance patients have to travel to receive dialysis, thereby ensuring they receive the care they need and enabling them to remain on Country and connected with their communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to achieving better health outcomes for First Nations people and key to this is pursuing and delivering on its commitments in a manner that gives practical effect to the Priority Reforms of the National Agreement on Closing the Gap (National Agreement).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Priority Reforms One and Two of the National Agreement in particular, the Government has committed to pursuing formal partnerships and shared decision-making arrangements and to building the community-controlled sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure the measure is implemented in line with the National Agreement and Priority Reforms One and Two, it is crucial that robust engagement is undertaken with key delivery agents, particularly the local Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service, Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation (Maari Ma).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This will ensure Maari Ma's views, along with those of NSW Health, guide the design of the measure so that it both meets the needs and aspirations of communities in Far West NSW and ensures the ongoing sustainability of any dialysis service in the region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised officials from the Department of Health and Aged Care will be meeting with Maari Ma, NSW Health, and representatives from local communities later this month and potentially into August to finalise proposed delivery arrangements. I also understand the Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health, Senator the Hon Malarndirri McCarthy will also seek to engage with representatives from local communities in the July meetings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am confident this investment will make a real and positive difference in the lives of people with end-stage kidney disease in the Far West NSW community and surrounding areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 enclosing Petition EN4581, with 5,270 signatures, concerning the number of on hand Skilled Regional Visa (subclass 887) visa applications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the important and valuable contribution regional visa holders, including subclass 489 visa holders, make in closing labour and skills gaps and supporting businesses and communities through their commitment to living, working and studying in regional areas of Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the number of on hand visa applications, including in the subclass 887 caseload, is a priority for the Government. The Government appreciates that all applicants seek to have their visa applications finalised as quickly as possible.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While subclass 887 visa applicants already hold visas with work rights, the Government is actively seeking to address this situation and has dedicated resources to continue progress made on reducing visa backlogs. To that end, over 10,000 subclass 887 visas have been granted by the Department of Home Affairs since 1 July 2022.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a well-functioning payments system offering various payment methods, including the use of cash. The Government has committed to ensuring that Australians have continued access to cash. This commitment is contained in the Government's recently released Strategic Plan for the Payments System—https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2023-404960.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands that new technologies and processes can raise concerns for citizens, and I acknowledge the petition's concerns regarding a potential Australian central bank digital currency (CBDCfdie). As part of our commitment to modernise the Australian financial system to keep up with an increasingly digital economy, the Government is working with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to explore the benefits and risks of a CBDC. This includes the current pilot being run by the RBA and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, and is in line with the work of governments and central banks around the world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this time, no decision has been made to issue an Australian CBDC. However, I understand citizens' concerns about government oversight, programmable money, and monetary policy. These risks are not inherent to a CBDC but would result from specific design choices and features. I can assure you that the research work being conducted by the Government and the RBA is guided by principles of privacy protection.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 regarding Petition EN4641 which seeks to revise the employment regulations precluding people with coeliac disease from joining the Australian Defence Force (ADF).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence's medical entry standards govern the necessary health standards required of military personnel to meet operational requirements. These standards are set to ensure members are able to perform their duties safely in a deployed or operational setting. They also prevent members placing themselves or others at risk, such that the operation or mission may be compromised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An individual diagnosed with coeliac disease must adhere to a strict lifelong gluten free diet. This is currently the only management for coeliac disease as any exposure to gluten has the potential to cause small bowel damage and other serious health consequences. Consequently, current medical entry standards for the ADF excludes applicants who have coeliac disease. Considerations for this exclusion include the dietary restrictions and inability to take certain medications. There is also increased risk of incapacity and complications requiring medical treatment for those with coeliac disease which may not be available when deployed on operations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While an individual is able to manage their diet in a domestic environment, the ADF may be unable to guarantee a suitable diet during military exercises, operations, or service onboard a sea-going vessel. Simply procuring gluten-free ration packs does not offer sufficient mitigation to protect an individual with coeliac disease. In the case of vegetarians, if food options are exhausted, individuals can still obtain sufficient nutrition from non-vegetarian options. For individuals with coeliac disease this is not the case, and could place the individual at risk of harm due to the potential exposure to gluten.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">That said, Defence has retained members with coeliac disease who were diagnosed while in service, with appropriate employment and deployment restrictions. These decisions are made on a case by case basis, considering the member's condition stability, time since diagnosis, symptoms and dietary compliance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The recently released Defence Strategic Review recommends the Government review its recruitment framework to improve eligibility and the Government has agreed to this recommendation. This review will necessarily include matters such as how coeliac disease is dealt with at the time of recruitment.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to clearing visa backlogs. Strong progress has been made. As announced at the Jobs and Skills Summit on 1 and 2 September 2022, a one-off investment of $36.1 million has been made by the Government to fund an extra 500 positions to support temporary and migration visa processing undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs to reduce on hand visa applications, including in the subclass 494 caseload. We have finalised 5.42 million temporary and migration visa applications since 1 July 2022.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">There is more work to do to further reduce processing times. As the Department continues to uplift staff capacity and capability, implement new policy settings and streamline processes, processing times will trend down.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Waste Management and Recycling</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding Petition Number EN4664 about the removal of all non-biodegradable soft plastics in packaging.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to being a leader in resource management and recovery and achieving greater sustainability. Driving a circular economy approach for packaging will see our valuable materials reused, while reducing the environmental harm and carbon emissions that come from a linear production-to-landfill approach. We cannot achieve a circular economy or solve the plastics challenge without transforming Australia's packaging to be designed sustainably, collected efficiently, and recycled into valuable materials and new products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing and responsibly managing Australia's plastic waste is a priority for the government. In the short term, my department is working closely with industry to see soft plastic collection and recycling systems restored as soon as possible. Medium to long term solutions will include improved packaging design to ensure packaging materials are easier to recycle, new approaches to how packaging materials are collected and managed, and new technologies to recycle soft plastics back into food grade packaging or other marketable plastic products. The issues facing soft plastic collection and recycling are unfortunate, but they are temporary. Coles, Woolworths, and Aldi have released a roadmap that outlines the pathway to resume instore collection, which can be found on the supermarkets' websites. Industry has a lead role in improving the sustainability of plastics they use, and the government will continue to support them in delivering solutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In October 2022, all Environment Ministers agreed to reform the regulation of packaging by 2025 to ensure that all packaging available in Australia is designed to be recovered, reused, recycled, and reprocessed safely in line with circular economy principles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This reform is an opportunity to mandate obligations for industry and provide a framework to support and monitor industry progress against design and circularity objectives. I am committed to working with industry and the states and territories to address barriers to achieving the targets and to have a new fit-for-purpose regulatory scheme for packaging in place by 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is also supporting industry through infrastructure investment under the Recycling Modernisation Fund, fast-tracking the phase-out of problematic and unnecessary single-use plastics, and supporting households to recycle packaging correctly using the Australasian Recycling Label.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are many factors to be considered in the design and use of plastics to reduce the impact on the environment. While there is increasing interest from industry and consumers about biodegradable plastics, the term biodegradable can be misleading by implying packaging will safely degrade outside of a processing system. Some biodegradable plastics release toxic components into the environment as they degrade, fragmenting or breaking up into microplastics that further contribute to plastic pollution. There is also no requirement for products labelled as biodegradable to specify the conditions and timeframe within which the material must break down.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast, compostable plastic packaging certified to Australian Standard AS4736 or AS5810 must degrade or break down within relatively short timeframes and comply with important quality and ecotoxicity criteria. Certified compostable packaging can also offer value as part of a circular economy as an alternative for single-use plastics for facilitating the recovery of food waste where it is accepted through food organic recovery systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to recognise that there are many circumstances where recyclable plastic packaging will have a preferable outcome over biodegradable or certified compostable packaging. For example, conventional plastic packaging which can be recycled and reused multiple times in new packaging and other products has an improved life cycle outcome over biodegradable plastic which can take years to degrade and cannot be reused.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To reduce the environmental impact of soft plastic packaging it is essential that industry both reduces the use of plastic and adopts sustainable design principles. A central pillar of the government's reform of packaging regulation will ensure industry complies with obligations for the sustainable design of soft plastic packaging. These requirements could include the use of mono-materials, an overall reduction of plastic use, only using ink and labels compatible with recycling processes, increasing the use of recycled content, and adopting the Australasian Recycling Label. The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation's Sustainable Packaging Guidelines and the international CEFLEX soft plastics guidelines are currently available for industry to use as best practice models for soft plastics design.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are undertaking a comprehensive and ambitious program to address this significant national challenge in close collaboration with industry and state and territory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Superannuation</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4665 on changes to annual lodgements of the transfer balance account report (TBAR) for self-managed super funds (SMSFs). Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The law provides that the responsibility for the administration of Australia's superannuation and taxation system rests with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Given that the ATO is an independent body, the operation of certain aspects of the regulation of SMSFs is conducted by the ATO. This includes the aspects in relation to which the petition has raised concerns. Neither the Treasurer nor the Assistant Treasurer can legally intervene in the ATO' s exercise of its statutory powers. This ensures that its decisions and actions are, and are seen to be, free from political influence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO has advised that Australians who hold their retirement savings in an SMSF are not required to complete a TBAR unless they have a retirement phase event that impacts a member's transfer balance account. For example, the most common events to report involve starting a pension or death benefit income stream, or commuting a pension into a lump sum superannuation payment. This means that SMSFs do not need to complete a quarterly TBAR where one has previously been completed at the commencement of a pension, and the only transactions involve ongoing pension payments or investment earnings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO has also explained it consulted widely before revising the administrative arrangements for SMSF TBAR reporting. Overall, there was strong support for streamlining TBAR reporting for all SMSFs, as it is expected to reduce complexity for professionals and their clients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 6 March 2023 concerning Petition EN4674 which calls for the House of Representatives to make restriction, deletion, demotion, hiding or unpublishing of any fair and factual promotion of a Parliamentary e-petition by media or social media companies a contempt of Parliament. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to protecting and promoting the rights and freedoms of Australians, including freedom of speech and expression. These rights and freedoms underpin Australia's democracy and the Government continues to work to protect and promote these rights and freedoms.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As private companies, digital platforms are able to make decisions about the content on their platforms in line with their Terms of Service. Digital platforms often have Terms of Service and community standards that determine how users can interact with each other and how the content on their platforms will be moderated. Many digital platforms use technology to automatically detect and remove content that violates their Terms of Service and policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If someone is concerned with a decision made by a platform regarding the removal, moderation or banning of content, they may wish to contact the platform directly to lodge a complaint. Many of the major digital platforms have complaints mechanisms or systems to appeal decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 11 November 2022, the Treasurer, the Hon Jim Chalmers MP, and the Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, the Hon Dr Andrew Leigh MP, released the ACCC's 5th interim report for the Digital Platforms Services Inquiry (the report). The report recommends, in part, that the Government introduce specific consumer measures to improve the dispute resolution processes of digital platforms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Treasury undertook a public consultation process on the recommendations contained in the report through a consultation paper released in late December 2022. The Government is now considering the outcomes of this consultation process and feedback provided by stakeholders including in relation to social media dispute resolution mechanisms.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It has been the longstanding practice of successive Governments to manage the orderly delivery of Migration Program outcomes against planning levels. The Australian Government sets the size and composition of the Migration Program each year through the Government's Budget process, following consultations with state and territory governments, business and community groups and the wider public.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Processing times for Parent visas are impacted by a range of factors, including the number of places the Government allocates to a program each year, and the level of demand for each visa category. High volumes of Parent visa application lodgements, which for a number of years exceeded annual migration program planning levels set by successive Governments, have resulted in extended processing times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the availability of key assessment services, such as health checks. This impacted applicants' ability to meet visa criteria, and disrupted the Department of Home Affairs' visa processing services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The time taken to process visa applications can also vary according to the individual circumstances of each case. The quality and completeness of applications, applicants' responsiveness to requests for information, and the complexities often involved in assessing character, health and security requirements, may all influence processing times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The processing of Family visa application backlogs, particularly in the Parent program, remains a priority for the Government. Reducing the Parent visa backlog is a complex issue and will require a number of strategies to be successful. The lengthy processing times for Parent visas was one of the key issues raised in public submissions to the 2021-22 Senate inquiry into the 'Efficacy, fairness, timeliness and costs of the processing and granting of visa classes which provide for or allow for family and partner reunions'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Among a range of other strategies under consideration, the Government has recognised the impact of the above factors on processing times and in the October 2022 Budget announced an increase in the migration planning level for Parent visas from 4,500 in 2021-22 to 8,500 places in 2022-23.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 September 2022, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, announced a comprehensive review of the purpose, structure and objectives of Australia's migration system to ensure it meets the challenges of the coming decade. Further information about the review can be found on the Department's website at: https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-and-support/how-to-engage-us/consultations/australias-22-23-migration-program. The future direction of the Family visa program, including Parent visas, will be informed as part of this review.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 March 2023 regarding petition EN4805 which suggests the provision of routine sepsis screening for children and other at-risk Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government shares the concerns raised in this petition about the impacts of sepsis on the Australian community. The Government agrees that there is a genuine need for improved awareness and understanding, early detection and better treatment of sepsis, particularly for First Nations people who are disproportionally affected by sepsis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To address this issue, in September 2019 the Government committed $1.5 million to the National Sepsis Program (NSP) to deliver a broad range of research activities and other measures to improve the awareness, diagnosis and the management of sepsis. The NSP was led and coordinated by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (Commission) in partnership with Sepsis Australia through The George Institute for Global Health (TGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The aim of the NSP is to assist in raising awareness of the key symptoms of sepsis, resulting in earlier presentation to health care services, and a subsequent reduced burden of disease and mortality arising from sepsis complications. It further aims to improve the recognition of sepsis in all health care settings and ensuring appropriate care for sepsis survivors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the NSP, the Commission developed a new Sepsis National Clinical Care Standard, which was launched on 30 June 2022. This clinical care standard provides guidance to consumers, clinicians, and healthcare services to help ensure that sepsis is recognised early, and patients receive coordinated, best practice care. In addition to this standard, the NSP includes a further seven projects assisting to achieve the NSP's aim. More information is available at:  www.safetyandguality.gov.au/our-work/national-sepsis-program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has committed to providing a further $2.1 million over two years from 2022-2023 for the NSP Extension. This additional funding will build on the first phase of the NSP as well as delivering additional projects.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The projects under the NSP Extension include:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The development of targeted sepsis education resources for undergraduate health programs and health professionals across primary and acute care settings is an important component of the NSP Extension. It will include sepsis subject curriculum development for medical, nursing and allied health undergraduate program. It will also include the development and post-implementation evaluation of training models and education resources to ensure a greater understanding of sepsis recognition and management. This education will assist the Australian health workforce to become better trained in the diagnosis and screening of sepsis, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given their longstanding expertise of sepsis in Australia, the Commission will continue to work in partnership with TGI and Sepsis Australia under the NSP Extension. The Commission will also work with relevant stakeholders, including but not limited to, consumer organisations, consumers, First Nations organisations, researchers, health professionals, hospitals and health care services, and state and territory government agencies to deliver on these activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also committed to health and medical research and invests in Australian research and its translation into practice to ensure Australia's entire health system is prepared for current and future challenges. The Government provides direct support for health and medical research through the complementary Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From inception in 2015 to 31 March 2023, the MRFF has invested $21.22 million, through eight research grants, on sepsis. One of these research grants, awarded to Flinders University, has a particular focus on equitable access to full blood evaluation testing at the point-of-care in remote primary health, providing fast access to blood test results to help early diagnosis of sepsis or other infections. More information on the awarded grants is available at www.health.gov.au/ resources/publications/medical-research-future-fund-mrff-grant-recipients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this MRFF funding, between 2000 and 2022, the NHMRC has expended $78.1 million to research relevant to sepsis. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 17 May 2023 regarding Petition EN4810 asking the House of Representatives to ban messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines in Australia or to introduce a two-year moratorium so that further safety testing can be done.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safety of the Australian population has always been the Australian Government's highest priority and we strongly support immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure. The COVID-19 vaccine program's primary goal is to minimise the risk of severe disease, including hospitalisation and death. For this reason, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines are based on the expert medical advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the national medicines regulator.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can assure you that the COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia have received the same high level of scrutiny as other prescription medicines and vaccines. The TGA, part of the Department of Health and Aged Care, has comprehensively evaluated each of the COVID-19 vaccines to ensure that they meet Australia's high standards of safety, 'quality and efficacy prior to their approval for use and inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Once included on the ARTG, the TGA continues to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Alongside the TGA, experts in ATAGI closely monitor all current and emerging evidence on COVID-19 vaccines to make recommendations to the Government on whether to include a provisionally approved COVID-19 vaccine in the national vaccine rollout program. This includes safety, efficacy and effectiveness data from clinical trials, data on waning of immunity and local and international epidemiology. A body of evidence from clinical trials and extensive real-world evidence supports the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines and has resulted in ATAGI preferencing the use of mRNA vaccines in the COVID-19 vaccination program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ATAGI will continue to review and update recommendations when required due to a variety of factors, including the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, changing local and international epidemiology, emergence of real-world safety and efficacy data, and the addition of new vaccine formulations to the program. ATAGI statements on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, including their rationale for decision making and relevant references, are available at www.health.gov.au using the search term 'ATAGI'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, all COVID-19 vaccines were initially approved via the provisional approval pathway. A vaccine is provisionally approved by the TGA after a rigorous evaluation process is completed, and the benefits of the vaccine are considered to be much greater than any potential risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since provisional approval was granted, more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide and over 51.5 million mRNA vaccine doses have been administered in Australia. The safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated in clinical trials has been thoroughly substantiated by real-world use, providing reassurance about the safety of these vaccines. This includes that vaccination is highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalisation, and death from COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Continued approval is dependent upon the evidence of longer-term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment. As part of the provisional approval, sponsors are required to continue to submit longer-term evidence to the TGA. As this implies, these studies are continuing to gather data on longer-term safety and effectiveness to complement post-market monitoring and spontaneous adverse event data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine SPIKEVAX recently received approval from the TGA for full registration. In making this decision, the TGA carefully considered long-term follow-up data from a number of studies that confirmed the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA works closely with other regulators around the world to monitor and analyse COVID-19 vaccine safety data covering hundreds of millions of people, and reviews the latest evidence from clinical trials and peer-reviewed medical literature. This information continues to overwhelmingly support the safe and effective use of COVID-19 vaccines. It remains the consensus view of international regulators and health departments that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination continue to far outweigh the risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support the robust safety monitoring system, the TGA strongly encourages consumers and health professionals to report suspected adverse events, even if there is only a very small likelihood a vaccine was the cause. The easiest way to do this is to submit a report online at www.tga.gov.au and click on 'Report a problem' at the top right of the page, or call the Adverse Medicine Events line on 1300 633 424 to submit a report with the help of a pharmacist.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With large scale COVID-19 vaccination across the Australian population, it is possible that new symptoms or illnesses may coincidentally occur in the days or weeks after vaccination. This does not, however, automatically mean that these have been caused by the vaccine. In many cases, a definite causal relationship is not certain. The adverse event could be coincidental, related to an underlying illness, or due to other factors.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 17 May 2023, concerning the petition relating to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security (Tables for the Assessment of Work related Impairment for Disability Support Pension) Determination 2011</span> and nurse practitioners (EN4834).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Determination contains 15 individual Tables designed to assess a person's eligibility for Disability Support Pension (DSP) and are intended to assess a person's loss of functional capacity that affects their ability to work. The Tables are consistent with the World Health Organization's <span style="font-style:italic;">International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health</span>. As such, they are function-based rather than diagnosis-based and describe functional activities, abilities, symptoms and limitations that affect an individual's ability to work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new Determination, <span style="font-style:italic;">'Social Security (Tables for the Assessment of Work-related Impairment for Disability Support </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Pension) Determination 2023</span>' was registered on 2 March 2023 and took effect on 1 April 2023. The 2023 Impairment Tables built on the previous 2011 Determination, with changes made to improve consistency, address advancements in medical technology and terminology, and aim to ensure there is better clarity regarding eligibility for the DSP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to the implementation of the 2011 Determination, an Advisory Committee was established that considered the question of diagnosis very carefully. The Committee determined a high level of diagnostic expertise was required for the purposes of DSP and that a medical practitioner is most appropriate for providing a diagnosis. This has not changed and the requirement for a medical practitioner to provide a diagnosis has been retained in the new Determination. This is a consistent requirement across all of the Tables with the exception of Table 9—Intellectual Function due to the type of assessment used for this Table.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Building on the review conducted for the 2011 Determination, a more recent review was conducted prior to the introduction of the 2023 Determination. This process included extensive public consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, disability peak bodies, advocacy groups, medical and other health professionals, Services Australia staff (including the Health Professional Advisory Unit, which includes nurses) who interpret the Impairment Tables and individuals with lived experience of the DSP process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consultations were multi-phased allowing for public feedback on both the 2011 Determination and Exposure Draft of the new Determination, which was released in October 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My department's Engage website, a publicly accessible website used for large public consultations, was used for both phases of the consultation process. This was to ensure the views of a broad range of stakeholders were captured. These consultations took place throughout June-July 2021 and October-November 2022. Submissions made to the Senate Inquiry into the Purpose, Intent and Adequacy of DSP (the Senate Inquiry) relevant to the Impairment Tables were also taken into consideration as part of this review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there was a very broad and open consultation, nursing peak organisations were not explicitly consulted as part of this process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, medical practitioner diagnostic requirements were not raised as a general issue within the consultation process and review, nor was it a recommendation resulting from the Senate Inquiry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding concerns about nurse practitioners' role in supporting DSP claims, a diagnosis cannot be provided by a nurse practitioner for the purpose of DSP. However, nurse practitioners have always been able to provide corroborating evidence in support of a patient's claim. This may be in the form of assessments or reports, as well as supporting a medical practitioner to make a diagnosis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Evidence may be provided by a number of sources however not all sources are referenced by name within the Determination. Examples of types of evidence and health professionals that may provide it are not intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will continue to monitor policy settings of the Determination to ensure they remain appropriate. Input from individuals, groups and organisations is an important part of the policy review process and I acknowledge the concerns that have been raised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 17 May 2023, concerning a petition (EN4835) presented to the House of Representatives on reducing the retirement age for Aboriginal people in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no official retirement age in Australia. Retirement decisions are a matter for each individual.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Age Pension qualification rules are consistent across all population groups, including for Indigenous Australians. Consistent with legislation passed in 2009, the Age Pension qualification age has been increasing by 6 months every 2 years until it reaches 67 years on 1 July 2023. It is currently 66.5 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Age Pension qualifying age is not adjusted for factors which affect a person's longevity such as disability, race, or other social determinants of health. It reflects the accepted Australian community standard where seniors are no longer expected to participate in the labour force, rather than providing pension benefits for a particular number of years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All Australians under Age Pension age who need support, whether due to unemployment, illness and disability or caring responsibilities, are supported by Australia's social security safety net. This includes payments such as JobSeeker Payment, Carer Payment, Disability Support Pension and Parenting Payment. There are also payments for people undertaking study or an apprenticeship. More information about the different supports available is online at www.servicesaustralia.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When people reach 60 years of age, they may also become eligible for extra concessions from state and local government authorities through the Seniors Card. Recipients aged 60 or over are able to access their superannuation tax-free if they are paid from a taxed superannuation fund, which is another concession that benefits many seniors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 17 May 2023, about a petition (EN4851) presented in the House of Representatives on 9 May 2023 seeking Commonwealth financial support for current nursing and midwifery students while on clinical placements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Getting more Australians into work remains a key objective for the Government. For those who are studying and need additional help, our income support system is designed to be a safety net. Students who undertake placements as part of their studies may be eligible for student payments such as Youth Allowance or Austudy. To be eligible as a full-time student, a student must be undertaking at least 75 per cent of the normal full-time study load for that course. Practical training or placement off campus can count towards the full-time study load if the educational institution assigns credit points to the placement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that living on income support payments can be challenging, especially with the increases to the cost of living. As part of the Government's $14.6 billion cost-of-living package announced in the 2023-24 Budget, there are changes to income support payments including:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Increasing working age and student payments, including Youth Allowance and Austudy, by $40 per fortnight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 15 per cent, which is the largest increase in more than 30 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will commence from 20 September 2023, subject to the passage of legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Beyond income support, the Government is also delivering a number of targeted initiatives and programs to support nursing and midwifery students.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) Debt Reduction for Health Practitioners Program, which will encourage doctors and nurse practitioners to live and work in rural, remote or very remote areas of Australia by waiving indexation provided they meet the eligibility criteria, and reducing their outstanding HELP debt once they have met their obligations to complete the required amount of work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth is also working in collaboration with all jurisdictions to develop Australia's first National Nursing Workforce Strategy. The Strategy will provide a national-level strategic approach to nursing policy, seeking to fully realise the value of nurses, and the need to ensure that this highly qualified and skilled workforce is supported in Australia. It is expected to look at career pathways and specialisation for nurses across all settings and sectors. Opportunities to participate in consultation on the Strategy will be shared in the Commonwealth Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer's newsletter: www.health.gov.au/using-our- websites/subscriptions/subscribe-to-our-nursing-and-midwifery-newsletter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also providing $25.2 million over 5 years from 2022-23 to establish and deliver a National Nurse and Midwife Health Service (NNMHS), to provide free counselling and health support services for nurses, midwives and nursing and midwifery students, as well as referrals to other support services were required. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation will deliver the NNMHS, and it is anticipated the service will be operational in a phased approach in the second half of 2023.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also announced funding of $50.2 million over 4 years to expand the future nursing and midwifery workforce through a new Primary Care Nurse and Midwifery Scholarship program, to offer a total of 1,850 post-graduate scholarships for nurses and midwives. These scholarships will support registered nurses and midwives to undertake post-graduate study by supporting registered nurses to become nurse practitioners and midwives to become Eligible Midwives.</span>

The Accord Panel will focus on key priority areas including the affordability of, and contribution arrangements to, higher education. The panel will devise recommendations and performance targets that will improve the quality, accessibility, affordability and sustainability of higher education. The Accord Panel's final report is due to be presented to Government in December 2023.</span>

Regarding your query about emergency workers, states and territories are the first responders to any incident that occurs within their jurisdiction and have primary responsibility for the protection of life, property, and the environment within the bounds of their jurisdiction. This includes responsibility for ensuring their emergency services are trained to fulfil their emergency response roles and responsibilities.</span>

NEMA may receive a request for assistance from the states and territories during crisis response and recovery, especially where a disaster or crisis exceeds their capacity to respond. NEMA works closely with jurisdictions and communities to better prepare for disasters and recover long-term and remains committed to working collaboratively to identify challenges and provide viable solutions. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 May 2023 regarding Petition number EN4872—to improve access to Medicare for telehealth consultations with GPs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The design of permanent Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items for telehealth services was informed by the findings of the MBS Review Taskforce and other clinical experts. The requirement for a patient to have an established clinical relationship to be eligible for most common MBS telehealth services by GPs is aimed at promoting high-quality patient care. The available evidence suggests the best clinical outcomes from telehealth are achieved when it is part of a continuum of care, for patients' known medical conditions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For GP telehealth services, an established clinical relationship requires telehealth services to be provided by the patient's usual practitioner; defined as a medical practitioner (other than a specialist or consultant physician) who has provided at least one face-to-face service to the patient in the past 12 months; or is located at a medical practice at which at least one face-to-face service to the patient was provided, or arranged by, in the past 12 months. The established relationship requirement is an ongoing requirement with respect to every telehealth consultation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The requirement for a patient to have an established clinical relationship with a GP to access Medicare funded telehealth services with GPs has been in place since July 2020. This followed the rapid expansion of telehealth in response to COVID-19 and was designed and implemented in consultation with primary health care peak representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For each telehealth consultation, the patient must meet the established clinical relationship requirements, unless one of the following exemptions applies.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Patients who are housebound due to chronic illness or disability are encouraged to discuss the possibility of a home visit with their GP to fulfill the annual face-to-face requirement. Higher Medicare fees and rebates are a longstanding provision for services provided outside of consultation rooms, recognising the additional effort of GPs who travel to provide care to their patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is an Australian Government priority to maintain the highest standards of care for people and telehealth services cannot substitute for all in-person care. Regular face-to-face appointments remain important to ensure that patients, particularly those who have complex medical needs, are provided with comprehensive care including opportunities for physical observations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have asked the MBS Review Advisory Committee to monitor the use and impact of permanent telehealth arrangements, for both patients and practitioners and provide advice to Government in late 2023. This includes consideration of the established relationship requirement, existing exemptions and consideration of requests for additional exemptions for specific patient cohorts.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In regard to patients' concerns about attending GP clinics in person for fear of contracting COVID-19, the Government has released a 'National COVID-19 Health Management Plan for 2023 (National Plan) which is available at www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022- 12/national-covid-19-health-management-plan-for-2023 0.pdf.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Hospitals: Perinatal Bereavement Suites</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 17 May 2023 on behalf of the House of Representative's Standing Committee on Petitions regarding petition EN4873, which seeks a bereavement suite or room to be included in every hospital in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that each year in Australia, up to 110,000 families experience stillbirth or miscarriage. The death of a baby is a devastating and traumatic experience for parents, their families and support people, regardless of when the death occurs or the reason for the loss.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, maternity services are delivered through a mix of public and private services. The planning and delivery of Australian maternity services is predominantly undertaken by the states and territories through publicly funded care models, with the Australian Government providing national direction and supporting efforts to improve maternity care and outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA), agreed between the Government and all states and territories, sets out the governance and funding arrangements for public hospital services in Australia, including maternity services. The NHRA recognises that state and territory governments are the system managers of their public hospital systems, responsible for both system wide planning and the day-to-day administration of their public hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In their system manger role, states and territories determine the policies and arrangements to ensure the respectful and patient focussed provision of birthing services in their public hospitals, including any dedicated bereavement suite or room for families who have suffered a stillbirth. The Government does not have the power to mandate that states and territories provide specific services or facilities in public hospitals. Additionally, the Government does not regulate or licence private hospitals in respect of maternity facilities. As such, the petitioners may also wish to contact their respective state or territory Health Ministers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working closely with state and territory governments to improve the quality and safety of health services in health care setting across Australia, and to this end, providing funds for the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (Commission). The Commission aims to ensure that the health system is better informed, supported and organised to deliver safe and high-quality care through the development of standards such as the Clinical Care Standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Clinical Care Standards are nationally accepted standards of care for specific clinical conditions, for use in health services across Australia. The Stillbirth Clinical Care Standard describes the care that should be provided to women and also addresses bereavement care for parents who have experienced any form of perinatal loss.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">According to the Stillbirth Clinical Care Standard, healthcare services should ensure policies, procedures and protocols are implemented to support clinicians in providing respectful, comprehensive and culturally safe bereavement care to families experiencing a perinatal loss. This includes caring for families in locations that are private, quiet, and separate from other mothers and newborn babies, whenever possible. Further information is available online at www.safetyandquality.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government has invested a total of $44.5 million in measures to reduce stillbirths and support families affected by stillbirth under the National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan. Components of this funding include:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$4.2 million for Red Nose Australia's Hospital to Home Program, which offers targeted support services for families who experience stillbirth, including early support to assist in the transfer of bereaved families between hospital and support services</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$5.1 million in grants for three organisations to develop and implement holistic and individualised bereavement care for women and families from higher-risk population groups who have experienced stillbirth or miscarriage, and education for the health professionals who support them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also led the development of the Woman-centred care: Strategic directions for Australian maternity services to provide national strategic directions to support Australia's high-quality maternity care system and enable improvements in line with contemporary practice, evidence, and international developments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 May 2023 regarding petition EN4886 on the delisting of Fiasp(R) and Fiasp FlexTouch(R) from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From time to time, medicines are delisted from the PBS. This generally occurs at the request of the company responsible for the supply of the medicine in Australia (sponsor). If the sponsor requests to delist the only brand of an item listed on the PBS, a formal request and. a reason for delisting must be submitted to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) for consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBAC is an independent expert body which advises the Australian Government about the listing of medicines on the PBS and comprises of experts in the fields of medicine, health economics, social policy, health technology and pharmacology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government relies on the advice of the PBAC when considering the removal of medicines from the PBS. It also cannot change the circumstances of a listing on the PBS unless the PBAC makes a recommendation in favour of doing so. When considering a medicine for proposed PBS delisting or listing the PBAC is required to give consideration to the effectiveness and cost of the medicine, including by comparing with that of alternative treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Pty Limited, the sponsor of the brands Fiasp and Fiasp FlexTouch, requested the delisting of these brands from the PBS from 1 April 2023 due to a commercial decision. The Summary of Changes is published on the PBS website at www.pbs.gov.au/publication/schedule/2023/04/2023-04-01-general-soc.pdf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBAC considered the delisting of these brands and noted patients would be able to switch to other PBS-listed forms of insulin aspart. There are currently four forms of insulin aspart (supplied as five brands) subsidised through the PBS, which are set out in the table below:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 17 May 2023 regarding Petition EN4892 which requests NBN upgrades for Smythesdale, Scarsdale and surrounding regional towns in Victoria.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Improving the quality, resilience and reliability of telecommunications services for regional Australians is one of the Government's top priorities. The Government is investing in the NBN to improve regional connectivity and deliver benefits to millions of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Residents in Smythesdale and Scarsdale are among the one million premises in regional and remote Australia that will have access to higher speeds on NBN fixed wireless services or greater data limits on Sky Muster services as a result of the Government providing $480 million towards an upgrade of the NBN fixed wireless network by the end of 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All premises in the new, expanded fixed wireless coverage footprint will be able to access higher peak speed services of up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download with peak upload speeds of up to 20 Mbps. Around 85 per cent of fixed wireless premises will be able to access a service with peak download speeds of up to 250 Mbps and peak upload speeds of up to 20 Mbps. The upgrade is also expected to allow the fixed wireless network to achieve typical wholesale busy period download speeds of at least 50 Mbps (for consumers on broadband plans with higher advertised speeds than 50 Mbps).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The upgrade has also enabled NBN Co to launch the new Sky Muster Plus Premium plan that delivers 100 per cent unmetered data usage and faster burst speeds of up to 100 Mbps. This follows a successful trial with over 10,000 Sky Muster Plus customers to test the feasibility of the new product.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sky Muster Plus Premium is the latest step in enhancing the NBN Sky Muster satellite network to keep pace with customer expectations and advancements in technology to deliver more capacity for satellite users, enhanced network performance and enhanced data allowances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At present around 400,000 homes and small businesses are able to connect to the NBN via satellite but this number will drop as the fixed wireless upgrade progresses. By the end of the fixed wireless upgrade, around 300,000 premises across Australia will have access to the NBN via Sky Muster services. This reduction in numbers, will support NBN Co to provide enhanced consumer experience to those on Sky Muster services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, the Government has committed $656 million to the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia which aims to further improve communications services in regional and rural communities, including through further rounds of the Regional Connectivity Program (RCP).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applications are now being accepted for Round 3 of the RCP and are open until 11 August 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the application process, the Government has also launched an online project noticeboard to help regional communities like Smythesdale and Scarsdale, as well as local, state and territory governments and other interested parties to form partnerships with the telecommunications sector and to develop applications for funding. The noticeboard can be accessed on the department's website at www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-communications-arts/internet/regional-connectivity-program/register-your-project-proposal-rcp.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also requests a mandate for internet service providers (ISPs) to support IPv6 services. While many ISPs in Australia support IPv6 services, many do not. The delivery of telecommunications services is highly competitive, which empowers consumers to choose service providers that support their needs. Consumers may wish to consider whether their provider complies with IPv6 when comparing available services. It is not current Government policy to mandate the use of IPv6 by ISPs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the notice of a petition referral (petition number EN4899) dated 17 May 2023, regarding the Disability Support Pension and the partner income test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's social security system is designed to provide a safety net for people who, for reasons such as age, disability, caring responsibilities or unemployment, are unable to fully support themselves. The Australian Government is committed to a welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, encourages those who are able to work or study, and is sustainable for future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The social security income test uses the gross income of both partners, even if one of the partners does not receive a social security payment. This is based on the principle that couples are able to pool their resources for their mutual benefit. Couples generally share their expenses, such as various utilities including electricity, gas, internet and water. Accordingly, the income of each member of a couple is assessed for the purposes of the social security income test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Taking into account the combined gross income and assets of both partners also ensures that partnered couples with similar (combined) levels of resources receive similar support from the social security system. If a partnered person's income support entitlements were based solely on their own income, this would result in unfair outcomes. For example, a couple where one person earned $80,000 and the other earned no income would receive more income support than another couple who both earned $40,000. In a needs-based social security system, this would not be equitable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a partnered person's income support entitlements were based solely on their own income, it would also create the situation where some couples could arrange their affairs so that only one member of a couple earns income—for example, income from investments—with the other member of the couple able to obtain a higher level of support from the social security system than would otherwise be the case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services Australia (Centrelink) has social workers who can assist people who are struggling financially. They can provide information or a referral to financial counselling services which are free. The Department of Social Services also provides funding to community organisations to deliver free, voluntary and confidential financial counselling services. Under these services, financial counsellors work with people in financial difficulty to address their financial problems, manage debt and make informed choices about their money in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention and hope the above information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 23 May 2023 regarding petition number EN4903 regarding mandatory military service for school leavers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not believe that there is a need for a mandatory conscription scheme for school leavers at this time. Defence' s primary role is protecting and advancing Australia's strategic interests. The Government believes that maintaining a well-trained and highly professional ADF is the most effective way of delivering on Australia's Defence requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The nature of military service in the current environment is such that our service personnel require substantial training to enable them to operate in complex and varied situations. To train a conscript force to a competent and safe level would require significant resources and take those highly trained and experienced personnel away from their primary role of delivering Defence capability to the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Notwithstanding the above, the Government does believe Australia's youth can benefit from close association with the ADF. There are a number of Defence initiatives to support youth engagement including the Cadets, the Young Endeavour Youth Scheme, the Defence Work Experience Program and the Gap Year program. More information is available at www.defenceyouth.gov.au.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence dated 17 May 2023, concerning petition EN4919 that seeks the Australian Government to increase Parenting Payment (Single).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government welcomes feedback from the community, and I acknowledge the concerns raised in the petition about the financial circumstances of single parents on income support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the important role that parents play as carers of children in Australia. The Government is committed to building a social security system that provides a strong safety net to support and supports single parents, women and people in Australia who rely on income support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 Budget, the Government announced a $1.9 billion expansion of Parenting Payment (Single) by raising the youngest dependent child age limit from 8 to 14 years. Under this measure, eligible single principal carers will no longer transfer to JobSeeker Payment when their youngest child turns 8 and will continue to receive support through Parenting Payment (Single) until their youngest dependent child turns 14. By 14 years of age, children have typically settled into high school and need less parental supervision, and single parents are in a much stronger position to take on paid work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This measure will enable eligible single parents to continue to receive the higher level of support provided by Parenting Payment (Single), with a current base rate of $922.10 per fortnight, until their youngest child turns 14. With these changes, eligible single parents currently on JobSeeker Payment will receive an increase to payments of $176.90 per fortnight. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More than 90 per cent of parents who will benefit from this change are single mothers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recipients transferring from JobSeeker Payment who earn income will also benefit from the more generous income testing arrangements associated with Parenting Payment (Single). They will continue to receive the same level of support from Family Tax Benefit (Part A and Part B) and other applicable supplements such as Rent Assistance, Pharmaceutical Allowance and Telephone Allowance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will commence from 20 September 2023, subject to the passage of legislation. This timing aligns with the next round of legislated indexation changes for Parenting Payment. This means recipients will receive the increases announced through the Budget and any increase resulting from indexation, at the same time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust the information provided will be of assistance. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter conveying Petition EN4926.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is deploying all elements of national power to make Australia more stable, confident and secure at home, and more influential in the world. Australia exercises our own agency and makes decisions in our own interests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Alliance between Australia and the United States has never been more important given our current strategic environment. The United States has been an indispensable partner whose contributions to the strategic balance in our region has guaranteed a long, uninterrupted period of stability and prosperity. As our region has changed, so too has our Alliance with the United States. For example, we are building cooperation across economic development, climate change, health and disaster management. We recognise that Australia's security and prosperity is best served by a strategic equilibrium in our region, to which the United States plays a crucial balancing role.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to defend and advance the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, both at home and abroad. All countries have room for improvement in their human rights situations, and the United States is no exception. Australia has regular engagement with the United States on human rights. The United States has a diverse and robust polity with checks and balances, and varied pathways to ensure that fundamental rights and freedoms are guaranteed. The 2020 Universal Period Review of the United States, undertaken by the Human Rights Council every five years, recognised longstanding US leadership in shaping and protecting international human rights. Australia has also welcomed President Biden's very clear support for sexual and reproductive health and rights, as demonstrated by his Executive Orders to safeguard access to these health services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our Government will continue to ensure that Australia's alliances and partnerships serve our national interest and support the peace, stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email sharing a petition calling for Australia to work with other countries to establish a ceasefire and peace talks relating to Russia's war in Ukraine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia condemns Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Russia's invasion renders stark Australia's commitment to a world in which no country dominates and no country is dominated. It is a gross violation of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. Australia seeks a world that is peaceful and predictable, that is governed by accepted rules and norms, and where all countries can cooperate, trade and thrive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia supports President Zelenskyy's 10 Point Peace Formula, which articulates Ukraine's terms for a just and lasting peace. Ukraine has made clear that the only way to achieve peace is to restore Ukraine's territorial integrity and hold Russia to account for its war of aggression. We continue to work with partners to empower Ukraine to resolve this conflict on its own terms. This objective underpins both our support for Ukraine and our efforts to impose costs on Russia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia unequivocally supports Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and right to self- determination. Through the Quad Leaders' Joint Statement in May, Prime Minister Albanese affirmed that Australia stands for "adherence to international law, peaceful resolution of dispute and respect for principles of the UN Charter". The Prime Minister earlier reiterated the need for "an immediate cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution to the conflict" in the Joint Statement of the 1st Australia-India Annual Summit held in March.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's calls for peace and respect for international law are reflected in our actions. Australia co-sponsored and voted in favour of the resolution 'Principles for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine' at the United Nations General Assembly on 23 February 2023. Through this resolution, the General Assembly reaffirmed its commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, underscored the need to reach a lasting peace in Ukraine as soon as possible and called on UN member states to redouble diplomatic efforts to achieve this. It also called on Russia to completely and unconditionally withdraw its military forces from Ukraine and to cease hostilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to holding Russia to account for its illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine; an invasion that cannot be minimised and cannot be normalised. We are working closely with Five Eyes, G7 and other partners to impose significant economic and political costs on Russia and those supporting its invasion. The Government continues to expand Australia's comprehensive suite of sanctions and trade measures against Russia: denying Russia access to our markets and ensuring Australia does not inadvertently fund Russia's war machine. We have imposed more than 1,100 targeted financial sanctions in response to Russia's full-scale invasion. We have also joined a core group of partners to file an intervention at the International Court of Justice in support of Ukraine's case against Russia to ensure Russia's leadership is held accountable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to our diplomatic efforts and defence assistance for Ukraine, Australia is proud to have provided $75 million in humanitarian aid to help meet the needs of the Ukrainian people.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 17 May 2023 regarding Petition EN4939 requesting that telecommunications companies be prevented from imposing direct debit only payment options on customers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will do what is necessary to ensure that telecommunications services enrich the lives of all Australians rather than cause them inconvenience, frustration, or detriment. I am considering the existing telecommunications consumer protections framework to determine whether it remains fit for purpose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware of concerns being raised about the increasing preference of telecommunications providers for direct debit payment and limiting payment options. I thank the petitioners for raising this matter and note it has also been raised by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) and the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network. I am looking at the issue closely.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By way of background, I note that telecommunications-specific consumer protections are contained in various legislation, industry standards and service provider determinations. They are also contained in industry codes, such as the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code (TCP Code), which is designed to protect consumer rights and to make clear the obligations of telephone and internet service providers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TCP Code provides safeguards on issues such as sales and customer service, contracts, billing, credit and debt management and changing suppliers. The TCP Code requires, among other things, telecommunications providers to offer at least one free bill payment method. However, I note the ACMA has not formed the view that direct debit payment options breach existing rules. Further information is available on the website of the ACMA at: www.acma.gov.au/telecommunications-consumer-protection-code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TCP Code was developed by the telecommunications industry body, Communications Alliance, in consultation with stakeholders. It was then registered by the ACMA. The current version of the code is required to be reviewed in 2024, however, the review process has already commenced. You can find further information on the website of Communications Alliance at www.commsalliance.com.au/Documents/TCP-Code-Review-2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recently held a consumer roundtable with key stakeholders to discuss the retail-level consumer protection framework. Participants included consumer and industry representatives, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the ACMA. I am considering advice provided at the Roundtable including calls for greater use of directly enforceable regulation, in conjunction with (or instead of) aspects of the TCP Code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I will make any further announcements in relation to the consumer safeguards framework in due course. I refer the petitioners to my Department's website where I will publish any relevant announcements, there is also a subscription service to receive notifications, at www.minister.infrastructure.gov.au/rowland/media-release. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 17 May 2023 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning Petition EN4948—Victoria Cross Medal awarded to Leading Seaman Ronald Taylor 20863 for his actions serving in HMAS Yarra on 4 March 1942.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Leading Seaman Taylor's actions were reviewed during the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) Inquiry into 'Unresolved Recognition for Past Acts of Naval and Military Gallantry and Valour'. A copy of the 2013 Inquiry report is available at: https://defence-honours-tribunal.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/Valour-lnquiry-Report.pdf</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Chapter 24 of the Inquiry Report details the Tribunal's consideration of recognition for Leading Seaman Taylor. The Tribunal found Leading Seaman Taylor's case was not handled properly at the time. The Tribunal conducted merit reviews into his actions on S February and 4 March 1942, and concluded 'that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the award of an individual gallantry honour to Taylor for his actions'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Tribunal recommended Leading Seaman Taylor, along with the other crew members of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Yarra</span>, be recognised as a collective ship's company with a Unit Citation for Gallantry. On 2 March 2014 the Governor-General awarded HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Yarra</span> (II) a Unit Citation for Gallantry for acts of extraordinary gallantry in action off Singapore on 5 February 1942 and in the Indian Ocean on 4 March 1942.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the petitioners' interest and advocacy for Leading Seaman Taylor. However, noting the conclusions and recommendations of the Tribunal Inquiry there are no plans to review recognition for Leading Seaman Taylor.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If the petitioners have new evidence or information that was not available to the Tribunal Inquiry and may support a case for another merit review of the actions of Leading Seaman Taylor, they may contact Defence Honours and Awards via email at dha.policy@defence.gov.au for guidance on preparing an application for review.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence dated 17 May 2023, concerning petition EN4958 that seeks the Australian Government to cease the biannual indexation of unemployment payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The social security system is a safety net that delivers on the Government's commitment to support vulnerable people and ensure no one is left behind. Australia's social security system is a non-contributory system designed to support the basic living standards of all Australians, and increase their social and economic participation. It is a means-tested, residence based system, designed to provide income support to people who, for reasons such as age, unemployment or ill health, are unable to support themselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Income support payments, including the JobSeeker Payment, are designed to support people in Australia who are unable to support themselves whilst they look for a job or have a temporary injury or incapacity. Generally, most recipients of unemployment payments are also required to meet mutual obligation requirements. Mutual obligations policy is carefully considered by the Government in order to help people connect to employment and become job ready through engaging with employment services, job searching and participating in other activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that living on income support payments is challenging, and it is important rates of payments keep up with the cost of living. To address the effects of inflation on cost of living for those on a payment, income support payments such as JobSeeker Payment are increased each year in March and September in line with the Consumer Price Index.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Indexation of income support payments is a longstanding practice and is set out in legislation in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security Act 1991</span>. Payment indexation helps to ensure that Australians on some of the lowest incomes are able to continue to afford essential goods and services, by maintaining the real value of payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People who depend on income support for long periods rather than paid work face increased risks of financial hardship and exclusion from the workforce. The Government believes that every person should have the opportunity to find suitable employment and experience the benefits of being in a job, rather than relying on income support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The income and assets tests aim to ensure that income support is directed to those most in need with support reducing as the capacity of recipients to provide for themselves increases. The income test for income support payments includes income test free areas and proportional income test withdrawal rates. This gradual reduction of income support as a person earns more means that recipients are better off if they or their partner earn additional income, rather than relying solely on income support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 17 May 2023 on behalf of the House of Representative's Standing Committee on Petitions regarding petition EN4969, seeking to make sterilisation accessible to those who want it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Supporting, protecting and promoting the health and wellbeing of all Australian women and girls is a key priority for the Australian Government. The health of Australian women and girls is critical to their overall wellbeing and ability to participate in society. Women's health impacts not only individuals but also their families and communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), there are currently items to support access to permanent contraception surgical procedures, which may include sterilisation procedures or procedures that remove reproductive organs such as hysterectomy (uterus) or oophorectomy (ovary). These procedures can only be provided in-hospital. There is also an MBS item available for a unilateral or bilateral vasotomy or vasectomy that can be provided in or out of hospital.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For all medical services funded through Medicare, including permanent sterilisation, it is the responsibility of the practitioner providing the service to ensure that the service is clinically relevant and that all of the requirements of the relevant MBS item, as detailed in the item descriptor and associated explanatory notes, have been met. A medical service is considered clinically relevant if it is generally accepted in the medical profession as necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's National Women's Health Strategy 2020-2030 (Strategy) outlines a national approach to improving health outcomes for all women and girls, particularly those at greatest risk of poor health, and aims to reduce inequities in health outcomes. The. Strategy proposes action in five priority areas including maternal, sexual, and reproductive health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has established the National Women's Health Advisory Council (Council) to provide strategic advice and recommendations directly to Government to improve health outcomes for Australian women and girls. The Council membership is comprised of a mix of peak stakeholder organisations, consumer groups, academics, and medical and professional bodies to contribute the breadth of knowledge, expertise, and experiences necessary to inform all aspects of women's health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Senate Community Affairs References Committee recently released its report from the Inquiry into universal access to reproductive healthcare titled 'Ending the postcode lottery: Addressing barriers to sexual, maternity and reproductive healthcare in Australia' (the Report). The Inquiry aimed to address barriers to achieving priorities under the National Women's Health Strategy with reference to sexual and reproductive health information, treatment and services that offer options to women to empower choice and control in decision making about their bodies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is currently considering the recommendations of the Report, including enhancing access to and affordability of contraceptives, and will provide a response.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2023 regarding petition number EN4972—increase resources and funding for eating disorders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the substantial impact eating disorders can take on a person's mental, physical, and psychological wellbeing, as well as for their family and carers. The Australian Government is aware of the gaps within the eating disorder system of care and is committed to improving eating disorder services and treatment options to improve patient outcomes and relieve the strain on hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise the national significance of investing in ensuring all Australians can access affordable and appropriate supports and services for eating disorders. The Government has committed $271 million to eating disorder initiatives between 2018-19 and 2025-26 to address the gaps within the system of care and to improve eating disorder treatment and services nationally. The Government has committed to the following eating disorder initiatives:</span>

Wandi Nerida is a private facility on the Sunshine Coast operated by the Butterfly Foundation and this centre is operational.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The NEDC is currently undertaking an activity to map eating disorders content in tertiary curricula for health professionals. This project will identify potential pathways for change in curricula to better equip a range of health professionals to respond to eating disorders.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Voluntary assisted dying (VAD), sometimes referred to as euthanasia, is a very sensitive and complex issue, and I appreciate that members of the community have a range of views about this topic. The underlying principle of the Australian Government's investment in health services is quality of life, and this includes end-of-life care and supporting people to die with dignity, compassion and minimal pain.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2023 regarding petition EN4982 received by the Standing Committee on Petitions in the House of Representatives. Thank you for bringing this petition on the duration of bachelor degrees to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This issue relates to the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), the national policy that incorporates the qualifications from each education and training sector into a single comprehensive national qualifications framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each qualification type in the AQF has a volume of learning specified. Volume of learning is the typical duration that is required for a student to achieve the learning outcomes for that qualification type. For example, the volume of learning of a Bachelor Degree is typically 3 to 4 years, while the volume of learning of a Certificate II is typically 6 months to 1 year, A typical year of full time study is considered to be around 1,200 hours. For more information, access www.aqf.edu.au/publication/volume-learning-v2-20l4.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The volume of learning allocated to a course of study should include all teaching, learning and assessment activities required to achieve the learning outcomes. These activities may include some or all of the following: guided learning (such as classes, lectures, tutorials, on-line study or self-paced study guides), individual study, research, learning activities in the workplace and assessment activities. Therefore, whilst a Bachelor Degree may only require 15 hours of classes per week (as stated in the petition), this is only a fraction of the total learning required in order to successfully complete the qualification.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the petition's comment that "Tradies should be taught by teachers not other tradies", I note that the Registered Training Organisation Standards require training and assessment to be delivered by persons who have the training and assessment credentials specified in the Standards. All trainers and assessors must also undertake professional development and hold vocational competencies at least to the level being delivered and assessed, current industry skills directly relevant to the training and assessment being provided, and current knowledge and skills in vocational training and learning that informs their training and assessment.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2023 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, regarding Petition EN4985 discussing financial support for current nursing and midwifery students while on clinical placements. I am responding as the Acting Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the valuable contribution of the health professions in the community and is committed to making sure the highly qualified and skilled practitioner workforce is available to those who need it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Student clinical placements are intended to provide the opportunity to apply the theory and skills learned in a professional workplace. Students completing placements are not considered to be employees and therefore are not remunerated under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where a student's contract with the host business or organisation entitles them to receive money for the work they perform, the placement will likely turn into an employment relationship. You can find more information on this topic on the Fair Work Australia website at www.fairwork.gov.au and searching 'student placements'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer meets with jurisdictional counterparts regularly to discuss the nursing and midwifery workforce. From these discussions, Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania have established paid student nursing positions within their public health services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In some other jurisdictions, nursing students can work as Assistants in Nursing (or however named) once they have completed 12 months of their degree program. In addition, many registered and enrolled nursing students work as personal care or support workers in the aged and disability care sectors while completing their degrees in nursing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may wish to contact your relevant jurisdiction to discuss their programs for nursing students. Contact details for each jurisdiction can be found on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au by searching 'Local state and territory health departments'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be interested to know that the Government is investing in a significant incentive for eligible doctors and nurse practitioners to live and practice in rural, remote or very remote areas of Australia by way of introducing the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) Debt Reduction initiative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This initiative aims to increase the number of doctors and nurse practitioners living and working in rural, remote or very remote areas of Australia by reducing outstanding HELP debt for those who meet the eligibility criteria and obligation requirements of the program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Eligible doctors and nurse practitioners will be encouraged to live and work in rural, remote or very remote areas of Australia, with an offer from the Government to reduce their outstanding HELP debt, provided they meet the eligibility criteria and their obligations to complete the required amount of eligible work.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2023 regarding petition number EN4994 requesting the listing of Trikafta(R) (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients aged six to 11 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, Trikafta was first listed on the PBS from 1 April 2022 for patients with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older, who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I was pleased to recently announce the expanded listing of Trikafta on the PBS from 1 May 2023. This expanded listing provides subsidised access for patients with cystic fibrosis aged six to 11 years, who have at least one FS08del mutation in the CFTR gene.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This listing is expected to benefit over 500 children a year. Without PBS subsidy, this treatment could cost more than $250,000 per year.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2023 regarding petition number EN5000 calling for a Commonwealth Royal Commission into the COVID-19 pandemic response in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has well established arrangements in place to respond quickly and effectively to a range of health emergencies. These arrangements are set out in health sector emergency management plans, which are designed to integrate with broader national emergency plans, particularly the Australian Government Crisis Management Framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has world-class public health systems, and we are well-prepared to respond to communicable disease challenges. Australia works closely with the World Health Organization to ensure that it aligns with One Health activities across the suite of pandemic prevention, preparedness and response as part of its obligations under the International Health Regulations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be informed by leading experts, including the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Comprised of all state and territory Chief Health Officers and chaired by the Australian Chief Medical Officer, the AHPPC works with state and territory health departments to develop and adopt national health protection policies, guidelines, standards and seek alignment of plans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 30 June 2022, the Government commissioned an independent review of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine and treatment procurements. In September 2022 the review, led by Professor Jane Halton AO, handed down eight recommendations. The Government responded to the review in February 2023, accepting seven of the eight recommendations in full. The remaining recommendation, relating to the National Medical Stockpile, was partially accepted noting it was largely outside the terms of reference for the review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, has indicated the Government will undertake, at an appropriate future time, an inquiry into Australia's COVID-19 response that will examine the impact of the pandemic and the respective actions of governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note all states and territories, except the Northern Territory, have conducted, or are in the process of conducting, parliamentary inquiries into their COVID-19 responses. The timing of any national inquiry must be well considered, noting Australia is still experiencing COVID-19, with heightened risk during winter months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is establishing an Australian Centre for Disease Control (ACDC) which will enhance Australia's ongoing response and preparedness for current and emerging public health emergencies. Once established, the ACDC will help ensure ongoing pandemic preparedness, lead the federal response to future disease outbreaks, and work to prevent both non-communicable (chronic) and communicable (infectious) diseases. A staged rollout of the CDC is planned to commence in early 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additional information on the establishment of the ACDC, including a summary of consultation feedback, is available on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au/our-work/Australian-CDC.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2023 regarding Petition EN5014—Remove testicles to be recognised as a woman in law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes all people are entitled to respect, dignity and the opportunity to participate in society regardless of their personal attributes. It recognises to enjoy civil and political rights on an equal basis with others, people need to be able to do so free from discrimination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws make discrimination on the grounds of gender identity unlawful in a wide range of areas, including education, employment and the provision of goods, services and facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 'Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender' (Guidelines) standardise the evidence required for a person to change their sex or gender in personal records. Under the Guidelines, sex reassignment surgery and/or hormone therapy are not prerequisites for the recognition of a change of gender. The Guidelines apply to all Commonwealth departments and agencies. Marriage, passports and records held through agencies such as Medicare and Centrelink are matters for the Commonwealth, whereas birth certificates and gender recognition certificates are within the jurisdiction of states and territories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government does not adopt a single definition to define a person's gender. Consideration is given to chromosomal makeup, gender assigned at birth, and gender with which a person identifies. Health policies and access to health programs are based on clinical evidence and clinical need for all Australians, regardless of gender identity, biological characteristics, or genetic variations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All Government programs are designed to be inclusive and to provide better health and wellbeing for all Australians.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition number EN5016, presented in the House of Representatives on 22 May 2023, advocating for the imposition of sanctions and entry bans on Chinese individuals involved in perpetrating human rights violations and abuses in China.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australia Government has grave concerns about human rights in China: including human rights violations in Xinjiang; reports of the erosion of educational, religious, linguistic and cultural rights in Tibet; the persecution of individuals and groups on the basis of religion or belief; and the continuing erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has been clear and consistent in raising these concerns, publicly and privately, directly with China and in multilateral forums. I have raised human rights concerns in all of my engagements with my Chinese counterparts. On 1 March, Assistant Foreign Minister Watts delivered a statement at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), expressing Australia's concerns about human rights in China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. Australia has joined all eight joint statements at the HRC and UN General Assembly about human rights in China—including Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong- and regularly raises these concerns through national statements at the HRC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government employs every strategy at its disposal towards upholding human rights, consistent with our values and interests. Consistent with longstanding practice, we will not speculate on sanctions. Sanctions are only one tool available to government, and will rarely be our first choice in responding to human rights situations of concern. We will continue to convey our grave concerns about the human rights situation in China, and advocate directly with the Chinese Government, including at the highest level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 22 May 2023, concerning petition EN5020 to the House of Representatives, which relates to the residency requirements for the Age Pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the request in petition EN5020 for the inclusion of a discretionary power in relevant legislation enabling me, as Minister for Social Services, to make exceptions to Age Pension claim rules, where an individual is overseas due to extenuating circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a non-contributory, residence-based system. Under longstanding legislation, to claim an Australian social security payment, such as the Age Pension, a person must be both residing in Australia and physically present in Australia at the time of claim. Payment is also subject to other eligibility criteria, such as age requirements and income and assets tests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The only exception to these rules is for former Australian residents living in a country that has a social security agreement with Australia. Australia currently has social security agreements with 31 countries, which enable eligible people living in an agreement country to apply for certain payments, such as the Age Pension, from that country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has no plans to change these rules at this time. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the notice of a petition referral (petition number EN5041) dated 20 June 2023, regarding the partner income test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's social security system is designed to provide a safety net for people who, for reasons such as age, disability, caring responsibilities or unemployment, are unable to fully support themselves. The Australian Government is committed to a welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, encourages those who are able to work or study, and is sustainable for future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The social security income test uses the gross income of both partners, even if one of the partners does not receive a social security payment. This is based on the principle that couples are able to pool their resources for their mutual benefit. Couples generally share their expenses, such as electricity, gas, internet and water. Accordingly, the income of each member of a couple is assessed for the purposes of the social security income test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Taking into account the combined gross income and assets of both partners also ensures that different couples with similar (combined) levels of resources receive similar levels of support from the social security system. If a partnered person's income support entitlements were based solely on their own income, this would result in unfair outcomes. For example, a couple where one person earned $80,000 and the other earned no income would receive more income support than another couple who both earned $40,000. In a needs-based social security system, this would not be equitable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, basing a person's income support entitlements solely on their own income would create the situation where some couples could arrange their affairs so that only one member of a couple earns income—for example, income from investments—with the other member of the couple able to obtain a higher level of support from the social security system than would otherwise be the case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are safeguards in the social security system for victims of family, domestic, and sexual violence who are receiving or claiming an income support payment. These provisions outline how family, domestic, and sexual violence should be considered by Services Australia when determining whether a person is a member of a couple for social security purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services Australia (Centrelink) has social workers who can assist people who are struggling financially. They can provide information or a referral to financial counselling services which are free. The Department of Social Services also provides funding to community organisations to deliver free, voluntary and confidential financial counselling services. Under these services, financial counsellors work with people in financial difficulty to address their financial problems, manage debt and make informed choices about their money in the future.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Bureau of Meteorology</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 concerning <span style="font-style:italic;">EN5060 BOM use of actual thermometer temperatures and publishing of long term data.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bureau's methods for gathering, storing, analysing and reporting on weather and climate data have been developed over many decades, in collaboration with international peers and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The Bureau's methods have been independently peer reviewed and demonstrated to be sound and fit for purpose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bureau makes four main types of weather and climate data available, to meet a range of different purposes: raw data, quality-controlled data, homogenised data and gridded data. Each of these data types is publicly available and the Bureau does not prescribe or proscribe their use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Raw data are mostly used for applications that require data to be available in real time. You can see these data on the Bureau's Weather App. Raw data can also be found in field books, which are available via the Australian National Archive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Quality-controlled data, which exist for a larger range of locations and variables, are suitable for many purposes, such as providing records of observed historical rainfall or temperature data for a particular location, and are used for most standard reporting, such as hottest or coldest days on record. These data are available on the Bureau's website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Gridded data are derived from observations at individual automatic weather stations. These form the basis for the Bureau's mapping products. The Australian Gridded Climate Data monthly rainfall set is an example. You can access these data on the Bureau's website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Homogenised data allow historical data to be compared with recent data on a consistent basis. Sets of quality-controlled data from a range of stations representative of a region are homogenised to take into account changes over time in measurement technology and geographical locations of observation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bureau maintains stringent version control of its homogenised data. All revisions are documented, and both the original and the homogenised versions of data are made available on the Bureau's website (www.bom.gov.au/climate/data). This enables third parties to analyse data and make comparisons with the Bureau's work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the WMO's guidelines for best practice, the Bureau has installed over 700 automatic weather stations (AWS) across Australia. AWS readings are taken more frequently, available instantly, and are generally more precise than manual measurements.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 20 June 2023 regarding petition EN5071, which requests the Australian Government legislate that only flags of Australia be flown from public buildings and government-owned flagpoles in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian Government Flag Protocols encourage the dignified and respectful use of flags within Australia and its territories. The Protocols are based on longstanding practice and policy, and are not a matter of law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a decision for each organisation, including local councils, as to which flags are flown on their premises. The Government encourages all Australians to follow flag protocol, however, there is no proposal to legislate which flags should be flown.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian Government buildings fly or display the Australian National Flag when practicable during business hours in accordance with the flag protocol. The Government also respects the Australian Aboriginal Flag and the Torres Strait Islander Flag, and encourages all Australians to fly them along with the Australian National Flag. At times of special significance, this is especially encouraged as a symbol of respect and reconciliation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There may be cases where the national flag of another nation is flown on an Australian Government premises. For example, the Questacon building in Canberra has flown the Australian National Flag with the Japanese National Flag due to the significant history and relationship between Australia and Japan. Further information about this and the history is available on the Questacon website at www.guestacon.edu.au/science- communication/international-engagement/questacon-and-japan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are also circumstances where an Australian Government agency may share a building with other organisations, including representatives from another nation. In these cases it may be appropriate to display the national flag of another nation together with the Australian National Flag.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to the Australian Government's attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 referring to me for response petition EN5076 relating to the submission of petitions from repeat petitioners. The petition asks the House to 'ignore e-petitions from serial complainants'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petitioning of Parliament by citizens has a long history within the Westminster parliamentary tradition. In Australia, petitioning Parliament remains a fundamental right of the citizen. It is the only means by which an individual can directly place grievances before the Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rules for the content and form of petitions are set out in the standing orders of the House of Representatives. Relevantly, the standing orders do not prescribe a limit on the number of petitions which may be received from a single petitioner. Petitions may be received by the House on public or individual grievances, provided that they relate to matters over which the House has jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any changes to the standing orders are a matter for the House as a whole; it is not within the power of the Speaker to make changes. I trust that the Petitions Committee has had the opportunity to consider the petition and may reflect on the matters raised in future inquiries into its procedures.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 regarding petition EN5080 on the Australian Government's decision to increase maximum dispensing quantities for some medications listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's decision to implement this recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to increase the amount of medication a patient receives for more than 300 medicines is one that has patient benefit and reducing cost-of-living pressures at its core.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing medicine quantities provided on a single script will deliver significant savings for patients, which is why it is an accepted practice in many comparable jurisdictions around the world. Patients in countries that Australia most commonly compares itself with have similar arrangements in place, where patients can access up to 90 or 100 days of commonly used medicines on a single script, including France, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Claims of increased risk of overdose and misuse from some of the medicines eligible for 60-day dispensing is unfounded. Only patients with certain chronic medical conditions on stable treatment regimens will be eligible for these increased quantities. The option to prescribe two months' worth of medicine is a clinical decision made by a doctor. In making its recommendations, the PBAC applied the following guidance criteria to identify medicines that should not be listed with higher quantities:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">medicines where being able to stockpile large quantities could pose a risk to patient safety (for example: narcotics, paracetamol/codeine, psychostimulants, psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">medicines with a requirement for regular monitoring and frequent dose titration</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">medicines where the drug regimen is associated with management of progressively worsening disease or the symptoms are associated with relapse of disease and the patient is not expected to be stable for the next 12 months</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">medicines prescribed for short-term management of symptoms in chronic diseases</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">medicines in the Palliative Care section of the Schedule</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">medicines where the PBAC has recommended a listing that enables prescribers to prescribe less than six months therapy per prescription.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">National medicine shortages will not be exacerbated due to this initiative. Increasing maximum supply to two months will not increase the total volume of supply of these medicines, rather it will space supply intervals further apart as the same patients currently obtaining these medicines monthly, will attend the pharmacy every two months instead. Many people will also benefit from fewer GP visits because they will not be forced to renew a script every six months, resulting in millions of visits to the GP being freed up; reducing waiting lists and making it easier to see a doctor.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian pharmacies already do much more than just dispense medicines, and the Government wants our trusted pharmacists to play an even bigger role in the health care of Australians. That is why every dollar saved by the Government through fewer dispensing payments will be re-invested back into community pharmacy, to support these highly trained professionals to deliver expanded services, and better recognise pharmacists' scope of practice. As part of the 2023-24 Budget, the Government has committed to providing opportunities for community pharmacists to step out from behind dispensary and provide clinical services to patients, including:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$654.9 million over four years for Community Pharmacy Programs. This includes increasing the total budget for these programs under the Seventh Community Pharmacy Agreement (7CPA) from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion to ensure these could continue without any amendment, as well as securing funding for programs to be delivered beyond the 7CPA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$377.3 million over four years for a nationally consistent Opioid Dependence Treatment Program. This funding is in addition to the dispensing-related remuneration pharmacy owners will receive for these medicines being dispensed under the Section 100 Highly Specialised Drugs Community Access Program. Pharmacy owners are expected to receive $175 to $191 per patient per month under these new arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$114.1 million over four years for Commonwealth-funded administration of vaccines to those aged five years and over through the National Immunisation Program. Pharmacists will be paid $18.85, with no cost to the patient, per vaccine administered. This is the same amount paid to GPs for a Level A Consultation when delivering the same service—something pharmacy stakeholders have asked successive Governments for. Which vaccines can be administered by pharmacists is determined by state and territory legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$79.5 million over four years to double the total annual budget of the Regional Pharmacy Maintenance Allowance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to consider options to support community pharmacy. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's Research Training Program (RTP) is a stipend scholarship offered, on a calendar year basis, to higher education providers to support living expenses for both domestic and overseas students undertaking research doctorate and research masters degrees, known as higher degrees by research (HDRs). It is not considered as income for employment or employment-related activities, and as such is not linked to any benchmarks such as the National Minimum Wage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Universities have discretion to award RTP stipend rates within a base and maximum range. In 2023, the full-time base RTP stipend rate is $29,863 and the maximum rate is $46,653. This range acknowledges universities are best placed to determine the stipend rates that will enable them to achieve their research training priorities and meet the needs of students. The stipend rates currently offered by universities vary, and several universities have exercised their discretion to raise their minimum rates in recent years to above the full-time base rate.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence to me, received 20 June 2023, concerning Petition EN5089 on the goods and services tax (GST) threshold for individuals and non-profit organisations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the special role played by charities in the community and in recognition of this provides a higher threshold for GST registration compared to the threshold for businesses. The $150,000 (of GST turnover) GST registration threshold for not-for-profit organisations is required to achieve a balance between including all not-for-profit organisations in the GST system and avoiding unnecessary compliance costs for such organisations. The same principle applies with the GST turnover of $75,000 registration threshold for businesses. There is no GST threshold for individuals as they are not required to register with the Australian Taxation Office for GST purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A change to the existing registration threshold would amount to a change in the GST base. The GST is levied by the Government on behalf of the states and territories and any change to the GST base or rate requires unanimous support of the states and territories. The revenue from the GST goes to the states and territories and provides a secure source of funding to assist them in providing essential services to the community, such as health and education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once again, thank you for taking the time to write.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has not made any funding commitment towards Stage 4 of the Gold Coast Light Rail. The Queensland Government and Gold Coast City Council are currently undertaking planning works to assess options on a preferred route and consider the potential impacts on the community, cultural heritage and the environment.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Until the outcomes of the Review are known, the Government is not able to pre-empt the recommendations of the Independent Review, but will continue to work closely with the Queensland Government to deliver projects already under construction, and the Government's 2022 election commitments.</span>

If the Petitions Committee finds that a petition meets the requirements as set out in the standing orders, the petition is published on the parliament's website and is presented to the House. Once presented, a petition becomes part of the official record of the House and its terms are included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> for that day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, the Petitions Committee may also refer a petition to the minister responsible for the matters raised, for a written response. Under the standing orders, a minister is expected to provide the response within 90 days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost all petitions received by the House are referred to a minister for a written response. However, the Petitions Committee is currently seeking feedback on this approach from petitioners and other interested community members. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of electronic petitioning in 2016 has influenced the volume and nature of petitions received by the House. Given the ease of electronic petitioning, it's not surprising that there has been a significant increase in the number of petitions received in recent years. The total number of petitions presented to the House has jumped from 263 in the 44th Parliament, to 799 in the 45th Parliament, to 1,761 in the last Parliament. So far in this parliament 644 petitions have been presented. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has also been an increase in the number of petitions received with a very small number of signatures; and more people are choosing to submit multiple petitions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, the ministerial referral process is a valuable part of the House petitions system. What we are seeking feedback on is whether petitions with only a small number of signatures should be referred. In our discussions, the committee has considered the benefits of providing ministerial responses to petitioners, as well as the allocation of resources needed to coordinate and prepare a considered written response. We also want to ensure that petitions with a large amount of community support continue to receive responses of substance from the relevant minister, in a timely manner. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of its review, the committee has looked at procedures in other Westminster parliaments. In the House of Commons in the United Kingdom, petitions with 10,000 or more signatures receive a government response. In the Canadian House of Commons, petitions must receive 500 signatures to be presented in the house and referred to a minister. Some Australian state and territory parliaments also have a signature threshold for the referral of petitions for ministerial response, and others don't. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the spirit of petitioning, the Petitions Committee has decided to ask the Australian people for their views. An electronic survey is currently available on the House of Representatives petitions homepage on the parliament's website. It will be on the website for four weeks and we look forward to hearing from as many people as possible. The results of the survey will inform our approach to referring petitions moving forward and I look forward to updating the House in due course. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">1. review the practices and procedures of the House, with a view to improving safety, respect and inclusiveness, and,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">2. examine the House's sitting pattern and hours, considering the wellbeing and work/life balance of parliamentarians and workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee made six recommendations, based on the evidence received and in the spirit of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard</span> report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary chambers are unique work environments. Freedom of speech and the robust exchange of ideas are core principles of parliamentary democracy. But that doesn't mean that our debates shouldn't be respectful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of offensive language and disorderly conduct are already prohibited by the standing orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee recognises that specifying discriminatory language as offensive under standing order 89 would strengthen the Speaker's ability to rule such language out of order and set more explicit expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, the committee has recommended amending standing order 89 to specify that offensive language includes words that are sexist, racist, homophobic and otherwise exclusionary or discriminatory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The codes of conduct developed separately by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Standards, once adopted, will also contain specific prohibitions against bullying, harassment and discrimination in the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second recommendation is for an additional option to assist the Speaker to manage disorderly behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the Speaker can direct a member to leave the chamber for one hour under standing order 94(a). The alternative is to 'name' the member—a much more serious sanction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard throughout the inquiry that the one-hour withdrawal is not a significant deterrent to poor behaviour. We have therefore recommended changing standing orders so the Speaker can exclude a member for three hours for continued or more serious disorderly conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A three-hour penalty would mean a badly behaved member is more likely to miss speaking opportunities and important votes, and should help the Speaker address disorderly conduct swiftly and proportionally in instances where naming is not appropriate or warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our third recommendation is for a review of the training and guidance material available to members on the standing orders relating to language and behaviour in the chamber, and the avenues available for members to draw the Speaker's attention to potentially disorderly conduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our report acknowledges the need to balance several competing priorities when setting the days and hours of sitting. Australia's diverse demography and geography means that some members spend significant time travelling to Canberra and long periods away from their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the improvements made in successive parliaments, the committee has not recommended changes to sitting hours, but we will maintain a watching brief to monitor the careful balance between making the most of members' time in Canberra and maintaining wellbeing and safety. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee agreed that there would be benefits in establishing a House standing committee on gender equality, diversity and inclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such a committee would not only be able to scrutinise potential legislation referred to it and the work of the Public Service from a gender, diversity and inclusion perspective, but would provide an important forum for debate on these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee considers that it would be timely for the House to consider making the language in the standing orders gender-neutral during the next major review. This would help bring the standing orders into line with modern drafting practices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 5 is that the House consider establishing a standing committee on gender equality, diversity and inclusion. The coalition rejects this recommendation, especially pertaining to scrutinising the Public Service from a gender, diversity and inclusion perspective. The coalition also does not agree to scrutinise the potential effects of proposed legislation on gender equality, diversity and inclusion, as it is clearly unworkable and would prevent the efficient passage of legislation through the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the coalition notes that all legislation is prepared in accordance with a statement of compatibility with human rights, which considers, amongst other things, protection and discrimination on the grounds of sex. It is noted that members currently have the opportunity to speak to topics of their choosing on several occasions each sitting week. This includes the adjournment debates, members' statements, the grievance debate and private members' motions. It is open to members to discuss matters of gender equality, diversity and inclusion if they wish.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition rejects recommendation 6, which recommends that, during the next major review of the standing orders, the removal of masculine and feminine pronouns from the standing orders be considered. There is already gender-neutral language that naturally exists in the Australian parliament, as noted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard</span> report. The member of an electorate, when given the call, is already gender neutral, as well as the use of 'Speaker', 'Deputy Speaker', 'Chair', 'Deputy Chair', 'Minister' or even 'Prime Minister'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to reiterate that the coalition has no issue with the first four recommendations of this report; however, we believe that recommendations 5 and 6 would not improve the working order of the parliament, and we believe them to be unnecessary.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill lays out 13 reforms to improve transparency, reduce financial influence and level the playing field. These changes have the broad support of the crossbench, democracy think tanks, civil society organisations and academics, some of whom are here in the chamber today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms build on the work of many other crossbenchers, including the members for Mayo, Clark, Warringah and Indi and the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are also likely to be supported by the one-third of Australians who didn't cast their primary vote for a major party last year and anyone who thinks transparency and a level playing field are good for democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first five changes relate to the current lack of transparency. Over the last 20 years, only 21 per cent of major parties' private funding has been disclosed donations. We need to fix disclosure requirements and ban lies so voters can make an informed choice about their representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes to lower the disclosure threshold from more than $16,000 to $1,000 and require disclosure within five business days. I ran a completely transparent real-time campaign. Ninety per cent of donors chose to reveal their names on my website. We didn't find out anything about where my opponent's funds came from until 10 months after the election and then we were only told about the source of 21 per cent of the Liberal Party's private revenue, for the whole party. We will never know who donated how much to my opponent's campaign or where it came from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes changes to broaden the gift definition and improve the so-called Transparency Register. This would mean that $14,000 dinners and $35,000 business roundtable subscriptions could not be hidden. It would also mean we could see exactly how much revenue the Labor Party earns from pokies. Over the last 20 years, 21 per cent of all private funding to the major parties came from undisclosed sources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill bans lies in political ads, using the approach proposed by the member for Warringah. The 2016 'Mediscare' incident and the 2019 death tax incident showed that both major parties are guilty of this and Australians deserve better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next three changes are aimed at reducing financial influence. Australians worry that politicians make decisions for vested interests, not for all of us. We need to reduce financial influence so we trust governments to make decisions in the best interests of the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes banning donations from companies inflicting social harm. Last year gambling and alcohol companies contributed $2 million to major parties, including $19,000 from Sportsbet to Minister Rowland, who is in charge of regulating gambling, in the week of the election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also proposes banning donations from current or potential substantial government contractors. The big four accounting firms contributed $4.3 million in donations to major parties in the last 10 years. During this time, the value of their government contracts has increased by at least four times. Three-quarters of OECD countries don't allow these types of donations, and it's time Australia joined them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill requires member approval for corporate and union donations. Australians are concerned about unions and companies having disproportionate influence in politics. The unions contributed $16 million to the Labor Party last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporate donations are banned completely in half the OECD countries. While this may face constitutional challenges in Australia, requiring member approval is a modest governance requirement that enhances transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The remaining five changes are about levelling the playing field. Last year, voters decided they wanted more political choice, with one-third casting their primary vote outside the major parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an uphill battle for community candidates, who face at least 13 party advantages and five incumbency advantages. Equalising some of these advantages would enable healthy political competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, the bill proposes to limit government advertising before elections. The coalition spent $31 million on its positive energy campaign before the last election, trying to convince us we weren't the worst OECD country on climate change. This was paid for by taxpayers. This was consistent with at least a doubling in government advertising before every election. Governments should not be able to use taxpayer funds to promote their party's achievements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill cleans up the postal voting process. Postal voting is an important part of our election process. But political candidates have been using this to harvest personal data and in many instances cause confusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill removes the political party exemptions from the privacy and spam acts so that political parties have to protect personal data and can't send election day spam text messages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also proposes setting up an independent campaign entity for independent candidates, to equalise access to voters and reporting dates between independents and parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also requires all new candidates to provide 100 signatures from the electorate, whether they're an independent or in a party. This will stop parties from parachuting in candidates with little support from the community they are meant to be representing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the coming months, the government will respond to the JSCEM report on the inquiry into the 2022 election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's up to all of us to make it clear to government that we expect its response to incorporate these changes and not just entrench the two-party system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I second the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Restoring Trust) Bill 2023, and I commend the member for Curtin for introducing this important electoral reform legislation. Public trust is key to proper functioning of democracy, and yet the Australia Talks National Survey found some very distressing data: 56 per cent of us agree with the statement that Australian politicians are often corrupt, and 89 per cent of us are confident that most politicians in Australia will lie if they feel the truth will hurt them politically. That is an indictment on the state of affairs, and it shows a profound disillusionment with politicians and the erosion of trust in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill contains 13 provisions aimed at restoring trust in our democracy through building in protections for integrity. These provisions have broad support from across the crossbench and the political spectrum in our communities. They include provisions to stop the lies in political advertising, which I previously advocated for in this place and which should have been in place to protect the referendum. It has the support of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters interim report tabled earlier this year, and the government needs to get moving on this. Making headlines again today are alleged breaches of confidence and public trust by big four consultancies. This time it is KPMG in the media spotlight for overcharging Defence for work not completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes measures aimed at ending the close association between businesses that benefit from public sector contracts and members of the government. The big four have donated some $4.3 million to major parties over the past decade. In the same time, they have seen a 400 per cent increase in the value of their government contracts, and we only know 21 per cent of the source of donations to major parties. So there is such a gap there that we need to absolutely claw. We need to restore trust in our democracy and in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These important reforms—like increasing transparency around political influence, limiting financial influence and levelling the playing field—are what the Australian people are calling for. If the Prime Minister is listening at all to the outcome of the 2022 election and if the Leader of the Opposition is listening at all to the message that came loud and clear from the Australian people: they want better, they want more transparency and they want more integrity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past 12 months the Albanese government has been spruiking its 'cheaper child care' policy. They promised that out-of-pocket costs would be lower and fees would not increase. When we asked about lack of access and the overworked and burnt-out educators, they basically shrugged their shoulders and said: 'Don't worry. We've got a plan.' Well, it's a plan that we're yet to actually see, and 1 July hit like a ticking time bomb for Australian families. My office has been inundated with emails from families who are further out of pocket now than they were before 1 July. Their fees have increased, eating most or all of their subsidy. Sarah in Jamisontown had her fees increased by $18 a day, and Naomi in Rothwell is now paying $45 more a day for her two children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Parenthood, 90 per cent of families have watched their childcare fees increase in recent weeks. The Prime Minister promised families they would be better off. But what I've been hearing is that families are struggling to pay their rent, their mortgage, their bills and their early learning fees. Many families were hoping to have extra money to pay for electricity bills, petrol for their car and other expenses. Instead they've been left under further economic stress. The last time Labor was in government fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years. They've already increased by eight per cent in the past nine months alone. And while Labor says fees will go down, it's pretty clear you can't trust a thing that comes out of this Prime Minister's mouth. Labor lied to the Australian people at the last election. They've broken promise after promise, and they'll continue to do so to stay in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last month I travelled to South Australia, to Victoria and to Tassie, visiting regional and rural communities, many of whom have no access to any care or are stuck on waiting lists as far as the eye can see. I spoke with highly educated, capable women and men who want to return to the workforce as teachers, nurses, GPs and even small-business owners. But there's no local centre, there's no local family day care, the closest provider is 40 minutes away, and the waiting list already has 50 families on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd had high hopes that the government would do something meaningful with the Community Child Care Fund, a program established by the coalition to support regional and rural communities. Yet when the government announced the $19 million grant round earlier this year I scanned the list of eligible communities and was severely disappointed. Many of the communities I've been to or heard from were not on that list and therefore were not eligible to apply—communities like Tumby Bay, Cummins, Augusta, Charlton, Biggenden, Wilmington, Ardrossan, and the list goes on. Labor spent $4.7 billion on childcare subsidies, and not $1 of that went to increase access. And none of it's going to regional, rural or remote communities, who have zero access. Labor have left these communities behind, and it's disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also warned the government that their policy would put further demand on a sector already under great pressure. I've spoken to hundreds of educators who are stressed, burning out, unsure how much longer they can stay in their jobs. They're working all day on the floor, and then they've got after-hours staff meetings, professional development and paperwork up to their eyeballs that they need to complete. They don't feel respected or valued, but they should be, because they care for and educate our youngest Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we ask about the plan for workforce, Labor simply rabbit on about their fee-free TAFE and University places. But what they fail to mention is that while Australians may enrol in early learning courses at TAFE at university many of them simply don't complete those courses and enter the sector. Those free places also won't support educators who have already completed their education and have been in the sector for many years. While we want to see more Australians at TAFE and university, there's no real plan to increase the number of educators in the pipeline and help retain them. It's become very clear that the Albanese government has no idea what it's doing. They have no plan to increase access, no plan to address rising fees and no plan to fix workforce concerns. With out-of-pocket costs rising yet again under Labor, Australian families deserve to know why they always pay much more under Labor.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I am grateful to the member for Moncrieff for bringing on this very important debate. It's just a shame that she seems to be the only member on the benches opposite who cares about this issue. We didn't hear a word about child care during the federal election, and we didn't really hear a word about child care during the nine years the previous government was in office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many of the issues the member for Moncrieff spoke about—the rising cost of child care, the workforce shortages and the waiting lists—are issues of real concern, but they are issues that have been around for many years. In fact, under the watch of those opposite, childcare costs increased by 41 per cent. What was their action? What was their plan to reduce the cost of child care? Nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in 2021, 73,000 people who wanted to work didn't look for work, because of the prohibitive cost of early childhood education and the impact that had on household budgets. As the member for Moncrieff said, child care was eating into a significant portion of household budgets. People were having to decide between paying for child care and choosing to work extra days, or choosing to work at all. That was a difficult decision they had to make when those opposite were in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that wages for early childhood educators stagnated. If people are considering a career in a particular industry, one of the main things they will ask is, 'What are the wages and conditions like in that industry?' Under those opposite, wages for early childhood educators flatlined; they stagnated. How do you attract someone to a profession when you do not give them a proper wage increase? That's what we saw for nine long years under those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Albanese Labor government, we've seen a real sense of purpose. In the very first budget, one of the signature pieces was around child care and making it more affordable for families. That goes to the heart of what we are trying to do as a government. We are getting more people in the workforce, particularly women—whilst there have been big gains when it comes to parenting and both parents stepping up, we know that it is often women who are left to bear the burden of caregiving. We're making it more affordable for families to send their kids to child care. This is an important measure that will help children, with all the rich learning that they experience in child care. It is also a good productivity step. Having more people in the workforce is good for our economy and good for productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The then Leader of the Opposition knew that at the time. That is why he made child care a signature policy that he campaigned on, and now we have delivered it. This is a significant policy decision of more than $4 billion injected into the early education sector that will benefit 1.2 million families. It is the biggest increase the sector has seen in a number of years, and it will have a tangible benefit for so many families. It means that, yes, they will see relief in their household budgets, but also we know that more kids are able to pick up days at school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by sharing an anecdote from my own son's experience at child care. He came home and told me that he knew about the solar system because he learnt about it at child care. We went through it together, and then he stopped before he got to Pluto. I reminded him that Pluto is a planet. He said 'No, Mummy, Pluto is not a planet.' And that is what child care does. It teaches kids things that even their parents have failed to learn.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  This motion on child care moved by the member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister, is an important one because it recognises that the Albanese government's cheaper child care policy has actually driven up the cost of early childhood education and care for families across Australia since it was implemented in July this year and that families across Australia continue to be unable to access early childhood education and care, particularly in regional and rural areas, which this side of the Houses, obviously, is particularly focused on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Reid, I note that the previous coalition government actually almost doubled childcare investment, to nearly $11 billion in 2022-23, and locked in ongoing funding for preschools and kindergartens. In fact, we made the biggest reforms of the childcare system in over 40 years. An ACCC report found that the average out-of-pocket cost to households had decreased since 2018, thanks to reforms undertaken by the coalition, which, as I said, were the biggest in 40 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes without saying that raising children is the most important responsibility for adults and parents in our country. The conversation occurring right now across Australia for those with young children—in their lounge rooms and in coffee shops and playgroups—is how does our family manage its budget with the cost-of-living challenges? Tough decision are being made by families every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House respect the need for choice and flexibility when it comes to the childcare and early childhood education system. We endeavour to have a light touch from government where we make it easier for families and parents and respect the choices they need to make. I fear that, in this place, we have become obsessed with a government sanctioned model of child care to the exclusion of all others, one that doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of life, particularly in rural and regional communities. We have become obsessed with long day child care at the expense of other models which families are seeking to explore to better fit their responsibilities and the way they manage their own family budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I challenge those opposite to work with the opposition in this case and work with the shadow minister, who is leading the way in having conversations with families around the country about how different models of child care may suit the modern Australian family. Right now, we have families making the tough choice about whether they can afford to have another child. That's a very sad decision for a family to have to make if they're desiring to have another member of their family—to start a family or expand their family. I believe the government has a responsibility to make sure that parents are respected in that decision and given the opportunity to make a decisions which is right for their own family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From my own experience and the countless conversations I've had in my community, most families have quite a hybrid model approach to the way they're managing their family budget and the way they're managing their care arrangements. The hybrid model involves parental care; kinship care, with a lot of grandparents being brought back into the unpaid workforce to assist in that regard; family day care models; and childcare centres. I don't think we should be casting any judgement on any family or any parent that has to make a decision that enables them to properly care for that No. 1 responsibility in their family. There should be no judgement whatsoever if a parent—primarily it tends to be a mother in modern Australian society—decides they want to spend more time at home and be a stay-at-home mum for an extended period. That shouldn't be the subject of judgement from the rest of the community. It's a reasonable choice to make, particularly if they believe they can make a more substantial contribution to their child's upbringing by being home more often. Likewise, a family, or a mother or a father, demanding longer hours in a childcare centre because of their own individual circumstances shouldn't be judged either. It's a reasonable choice to make. We should respect the choices that Australian families have to make. We need to move to a model that respects all those choices and offers greater flexibility for Australian families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In making those comments, I want to acknowledge the work of the shadow minister and the tireless advocacy she has put into her role in terms of meeting with people, particularly in rural and regional communities, where we have childcare deserts families would like to pick up more shifts and to return to the paid workforce but simply don't have the option of formalised child care available to them. I don't want this to be a debate where we just sling arrows back and forth across the chamber. I want this to be a debate where we recognise that Australian families charged with the incredible responsibility of raising children want to see the government work with them, offer them choice and flexibility, but, most importantly, offer those rural and regional members access to centres that are required to address their cost-of-living pressures but also give their children the absolute best opportunities to achieve their full potential in the Australia community. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Recently we celebrated Early Learning Matters Week. To celebrate our early learning educators and how important early learning is, I accepted an invitation to visit the Jerry Bailey Early Education and Care Service at Shoalhaven Heads. I was greeted by the friendly team of early learning educators and the very inquisitive children at Jerry Bailey's children's service. It was very easy to see the wide variety of educational and fun activities that the children were working on, which they got me to help them with. I particularly liked one of their most recent activities, a game with Indigenous words and pictures they proudly told me was made by a local Aboriginal woman. The children had been artistic before my visit, too, making a giant welcome and 'Thank you for visiting' card, complete with colourful painted children's handprints and artwork.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked how the Albanese government's cheaper child care had been received by parents. I was told that it was a very welcome relief indeed. Our cheaper child care is helping provide cost-of-living relief for around 4,800 families in Gilmore. It's also good because we know that the early years of a child's life are a critical window in a child's development. It is about investing in the early years, which will deliver long-term benefits for children, families, and our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, after the Albanese Labor government's cheaper childcare measures began to take effect, I met with local mum Lisa from Gerringong. Lisa told me that our cheaper childcare measures were great for her family. Lisa told me that cheaper child care means she doesn't have to choose between progressing her career as a health professional and being a mum. That's a huge win. I don't want to see a situation where people must choose between having a family and progressing in their careers. In Lisa's case, the Albanese Labor government's cheaper childcare measures are helping her have both. But cheaper child care isn't just good for Lisa's family, because Lisa works in health care and she works with children. Cheaper child care allowed Lisa to do another day at work per week. As part of her work, she could then help other families whose children needed her specialised services. Cheaper child care is about letting people make the choices they need and allowing them to do what is best for their family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that after a decade of inaction by the Liberal government and their deliberate design strategy to keep wages low, there are many challenges in the early learning sector, including low wages of early learning educators and the dire shortage of early learning places—it's a vicious cycle. I was recently contacted by a local mum due to go back to work as a teacher but was unable to secure a childcare place. Sadly, after years of neglect by the former government, this is common, but we are tackling the issues head on. Our cheaper child care is one important part of that, but we are also doing so much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of our early childhood educators is essential to the successful development of our children and our nation. It should be valued on its own merits, free of discriminatory assumptions based on the gender of the people who perform the work. As a result, last year, we passed the secure jobs, better pay bill, which allows for greater access to bargaining for lower paid and feminised sectors through the supported bargaining system, which will help workers negotiate better pay and conditions. We did this because we know that we have to do more to help lift early learning educators' pay and close the gender pay gap. It's why we have also implemented fee-free TAFE in industry skills shortage areas, like child care, and funded university places for early education teachers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a comprehensive Productivity Commission inquiry into Australia's childhood education and care system to help us chart a course for a universal and affordable early learning system in the great tradition of universal Medicare and universal superannuation. The inquiry will make recommendations to support affordable, accessible, equitable and high-quality early childhood education that reduces barriers to workforce participation and supports children's learning and development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot to do to support early learning educators and our early learning centres. We are getting on with the job. We know just how crucial the first five years are for children and their families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  I rise to support the member for Moncrieff's motion as families in the Flynn electorate need child care that is available and accessible, as well as affordable. However, in many communities, families cannot find a childcare place for their child, which is preventing parents from returning to work. At the last election, the Prime Minister promised Australian families lower out-of-pocket costs for early childhood education, yet 12 months since the Labor government has come to power, it's clear that its cheaper childcare policy will not deliver on that promise. Instead, we've seen fees and out-of-pocket costs increase and no additional places created for families. Early learning providers are increasing their fees—some twice in the last 12 months—and families are watching as their new subsidy is completely eaten up by those new fees. The last time Labor was in government, childcare fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years. They've increased by eight per cent in the last nine months. Labor has no plan to address increasing fees, no plan to increase access, no plans to address current workforce pressures faced by educators and no plans to address thin markets and childcare deserts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government said their policy would get thousands of women back into the workforce. The reality is that families are stuck on waiting lists and centres are capping enrolments because they don't have the workforce to cater for the additional families and extra days. Parents who want to return to work or take up extra hours can't because this government didn't do the work to make that happen. There are currently more than nine million Australians living in a childcare desert with little access to early learning education or none at all. Many families are struggling to access a spot for their children, especially those under 18 months and especially in rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year my office conducted research on child care in the Flynn electorate. The research found that there are 36 childcare providers in Flynn offering a maximum of 2,419 places. There are no childcare vacancies in Boyne Island, Gayndah, Mount Morgan, Mundubbera or Wondai. There are also childcare centres in Agnes Water, Emerald and Gladstone that do not have any childcare places either. Since this research, the kindergartens in Mount Morgan and Biloela have announced they will be closing, all because of lack of funding and bureaucratic red tape. Labor's plan states that Indigenous children will be able to access 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight from July 2023. Woorabinda and Eidsvold, with large First Nations populations, do not have those childcare places available. How can every Indigenous child be given 36 hours per fortnight when there are no places to be had?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government is doing nothing to support families, nothing to increase access for families who need it most and, on top of this, nothing to ease the cost-of-living pressures. Cost-of-living indexes released by the Bureau of Statistics lay bare the rising cost of living under the Albanese government, especially for working Australians. Working households experienced the highest annual rise on record, or 9.6 per cent, based on mortgage rate increases. Mortgage interest expenses blew out by 91.6 per cent—another record. In the last quarter, indexes for all five household types measured by cost-of-living indexes rose by up to 1.5 per cent. Insurance and financial services are the leading component, again driven by mortgage interest rate increases and larger insurance premiums. The data confirms that all Australians have experienced significant—and sometimes record—cost-of-living increases on Labor's watch. Families are reporting an increased cost of their daily fees in excess of $20 a day. The cost-of-living crisis in Australia is driving up the cost of rent, mortgages, groceries and everyday bills, like early childhood education and care bills for Australian families. On top of this, the government's inaction to address workforce shortages is limiting access to early childhood education and care for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Moncrieff is correct. This government must deliver more access to early childhood education and care places to support Australians to return to the workforce, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  I rise to highlight the work that the Albanese Labor government has undertaken to make child care cheaper, as well as its targeted cost-of-living measures that are being provided to Australians. In my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast there are many young parents and families benefiting from our government's cheaper childcare policy. From the month of July this year, 6,900 families in Robertson received an increase to their childcare subsidy. What this means is that an average family on a combined income of around $120,000 with one child in care will save around $1,700 in the first year of our policy coming into effect. That is $1,700 kept in the pockets of families living on the Central Coast and right across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, under the former Liberal government, we saw childcare fees rise by 49 per cent with no plan to help Australian families with these rising costs. I am proud to be part of a Labor federal government that continues to waste no time and is getting on with the job of supporting Australian families with cost of living. Across Australia there are now 1.2 million families benefiting from cheaper child care, which means more Australian families accessing affordable early childhood education and care across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government knows the importance of early childhood education and care and how critical those first five years are for the development of a young mind. Research supports the powerful role that early childhood education and care provides. Our government will continue to work on ways to make child care more accessible and more affordable for more Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the opportunity to thank all the early childhood educators on the Central Coast and right across this country that provide outstanding education and care. The work that you do is so important, and you have a federal government that is on your side. But there is more work to do, and I am confident in the leadership of the Minister for Education and the Minister for Early Childhood Education who are steering our government's approach towards making early childhood education and care more equitable and more accessible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's targeted cost-of-living relief does not stop at cheaper child care. This government has a suite of targeted cost-of-living measures that are helping Australians across the nation, and an area that I am particularly pleased to see investment in is Medicare. Australians know that it was the Australian Labor Party who built Medicare. It's only the Labor Party who will strengthen it and it is only the Labor Party that will continue to protect it. In the 2023-24 federal budget it was great to see the Treasurer announce an investment of $3.5 billion to triple the bulk-billing incentive. This injection supports patients and general practitioners and will strengthen what is the heart of Medicare, and that is bulk-billing. This is the largest ever increase to the bulk-billing incentive in the history of Medicare. I'm pleased to report that this investment will benefit 73,130 people living in the electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, which means more equitable access to a doctor and targeted cost-of-living relief for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Central Coast, the Albanese Labor government is progressing with our commitment to deliver two Medicare urgent care clinics, with one to be established in the north in Dobell and one in the south in my electorate of Robertson. Medicare urgent care clinics are game changers. They have been seen to be quite effective in other countries, like Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. They will be bulk-billed, and they will be open seven days a week, with extended operating hours. After nine long years of cuts and nine long years of neglect, the Albanese government is making Medicare stronger for all Australians, providing relief for Australians accessing health care and providing equitable access to general practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, another area where our government is easing the cost-of-living is energy bill assistance. In New South Wales 320,000 eligible small businesses will receive a $650 rebate towards their electricity bill, and we will continue to develop measures to ease the cost-of-living for all Australians.</span>

In fact, it came on the back of a report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which found that in the major cities there was an average of 400 childcare places per thousand children, but the numbers steadily decline as you head towards the country. In inner regional Australia we have 332 places per thousand; in outer regional areas we have 295 places per thousand; in remote, 212; and in very remote Australia we have 166 places per thousand children. Eighty-five per cent of my electorate is either outer regional, remote or very remote, and the remaining 15 per cent is inner regional. In none of those areas do we have the kind of levels that people enjoy in the city.</span>

He says that poor access to child care in the regions had been accepted as a universal experience and it was unacceptable. The article goes on to say that this would be one of the single biggest things that we cannot afford to have as a universality. It would improve the outcomes for a whole host of industries and people living in regional Australia. In fact, while the number of childcare places across Australia grew by 17 per cent in the past four years, it is primarily in the larger population areas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am indebted to our shadow minister, the member for Moncrieff. Angie Bell has been in my electorate twice in the last few months. We've met with over eight communities, all desperate for more child care. Where they have it, they don't have enough; and in the smaller centres, towns with typically less than a couple of thousand people, they don't have any child care at all. It's leading to people recruiting new workers, and then when they roll up they say, 'I can't stay here, because there's no child care;' people not accepting the job; and people leaving communities because they cannot juggle their career and child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of great concern to me that the government has chosen to put $4.7 billion into child care. This is not creating one new place. The privilege of these people who live in underserviced areas is to pay more tax so that other people in overserviced areas or better serviced areas can access a service which they cannot. There is a serious inequity here. I make the point that people would have cheered about the extra money the government is ploughing into child care, only to find now that their childcare centre is raising its rates by virtually as much as the increased subsidy—a $20 a day extra, in some cases, which is soaking up most of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Reid has just been on his feet and said the coalition government presided over a 49 per cent increase over the nine years we were in government. The problem for the member for Reid is that I've been here a bit longer than him. I can remember the previous Labor period of government, if he wants to go back and look at history. It was a six-year period where prices went up by 53 per cent, around nine per cent per annum. It's interesting that in the last nine months alone childcare fees in Australia have gone up by eight per cent. There is certainly no control over the price that parents are paying to access this service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my communities that I am petitioning for, we have a system in South Australia called Rural Care. It's run by the state government through the education department, and they are able to access the subsidy. They are intently opposed to expanding it, but it's limited to three staff maximum. So in a town that's got a couple of thousand people, it's simply inadequate. It's a good service, though; it works quite well. In my mind, in these populations that are subcommercial, the obvious players to come into that space are the state based education departments. State governments may not want to go down this pathway, but I think it's imperative that we reach an agreement with them from the Commonwealth government to say: 'These are communities that are missing out. We need to reach a mutual agreement.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I want to thank the member for Higgins for bringing forward this very important motion, which I'm very happy to support. It doesn't matter where you go on the New South Wales South Coast; the lack of affordable and social housing is at a crisis point. Every week, I hear from more and more people that are homeless or at risk of being homeless. And it doesn't discriminate. Families are at risk. Older people suddenly find themselves with nowhere to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We took our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund plan to the 2022 federal election. It's a plan that will provide 30,000 homes in the first five years. Importantly, it will be set up forever, regardless of who is in government, providing a steady supply of affordable and social homes for those that need them most—older people, families, frontline workers, veterans. It's a plan that has widespread support from industry, community housing and homelessness providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is now blocking the Housing Australia Future Fund and more social and affordable homes? The Liberals and the Greens. It's hard to believe that anyone in the parliament could block affordable and social housing. But we're getting on with it. That's why the Albanese government is delivering immediate action, like the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator to deliver thousands of new social rental homes across Australia, including $650 million in New South Wales. We have an ambitious housing agenda which will boost the supply of all housing with more social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I visited two local disability providers, Yumaro at Moruya and Jindelara at Ulladulla, that are crying out to build more independent living for people with a disability. I attended the opening of the Southern Youth and Family Services opening of accommodation for young people at Warilla, which is a fantastic project that looks amazing. But there is already a thirst from Southern Youth and Family Services for a similar facility in the Nowra area. Then there are the many people who contact my office, needing help with somewhere to live—like Lee, from Ulladulla. Lee contacted my office in 2020, saying that she was homeless and had nowhere to go. It was a very sad and, unfortunately, common story. Lee was told that, if she changed her area of preference to another town, she would be more likely to get housing. But Lee had family and connections in Ulladulla. She was born and raised there and, understandably, didn't want to leave. I did all I could to help Lee, and, thankfully, she is now in housing in Ulladulla. But it shouldn't have been that difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much demand for affordable and social housing, but who are getting in the way? The Liberals and the Greens—that's who. The Liberals and Greens are now blocking more affordable and social homes, and every day of delay by the Liberals and Greens means $1.3 million is not being spent on social and affordable housing for people who need it most. So I say to the Liberals and Greens: get out of the way and back this secure, ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable housing. We'll keep delivering to ensure that more people have a safe and affordable place to call home.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I say to the member for Gilmore: you still had 25 seconds; you could have bagged the Greens a little bit more. But I digress. The social and housing situation, in terms of affordability and availability, is a major issue, but the Greens are using what is essentially and primarily a state issue to garner votes in inner-city electorates to win federal seats. I know the Prime Minister has called this out and, to that extent, I agree with him. These days, all too often, the difference between state and federal spheres of government is diluted by people who should know better and who do know better but who use situations and policy areas, such as housing, to get votes. They know it is a state issue, yet they push on with federal seats in mind, and more's the pity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need more houses available for people who are doing it tough. They're doing it tough for a number of reasons. It's not only because we've got a Labor government in power and cost-of-living issues are going through the roof, and people are finding it so difficult to pay their power bills, their grocery bills and their rents, which are going up and up. But it's not the federal government's prerogative, responsibility or remit to put freezes in place on rents or to put situations in place whereby people who are quite rightly, honestly and accountably putting in place such things as negative gearing, which has been in place since the Hawke government. These are things which enable people to get into the housing market. These are things which enable people, quite rightly, to make the most of their own finances. What the Greens would do, if they had control, would be to have this parliament run everything, and that's not how it works. The states can't be let off the hook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Premier of New South Wales is in Wagga Wagga today on his first visit since he took charge of the state. I note that he has indicated, via Twitter, that he's having a bit of a crack at the fact: 'I might be in Wagga Wagga right now, but that won't stop me cheering on the mighty Matildas—let's bring this home!' I don't know why he feels he needs to have a whack at Wagga Wagga, which is the largest inland city New South Wales. It's a very progressive and very forward-thinking city, and he's making out that he's in some remote backwater. I note that yesterday he visited Gavin King's Prefabulous in Wagga and talked about that as part of a solution to the housing crisis. To that extent, I agree with him; they're doing a very, very good job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just about making funds available; it's also about having the resources and the workforce in place to build these social houses and housing in general. I note that Metricon last year was doing it very tough. Queensland firm Solido Builders, a small company specialising in luxury houses, appointed administrators last year. Perth based Home Innovation builders went into liquidation on the same day as another Western Australian company, New Sensation Homes, was placed in the hands of administrators. Condev Construction in Queensland specialised in multiunit residential constructions. It went into liquidation. ProBuild, a major construction company, was placed in administration. Other homebuilding companies going belly up included two Tasmanian based firms, Hotondo in February last year and Inside Out Construction in November 2021. They're doing it tough. Dennis Family Homes, Melbourne based, is scaling back its regional operations.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's this government doing about this? Very little, making it so tough, not addressing the major issues. You all go around, Labor members, and talk at your constituents instead of listening to them, talking about the things that quite frankly they're not discussing around the barbecues, around the sporting fields and around the weekend events. Start to get a little bit in touch with the electorate. Yes, we do need more social houses. What are you doing about it, apart from reading from your Labor dirt and talking points?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  The Albanese government has a broad agenda for safe and affordable housing. It's focused on providing security and dignity for all Australians, and I'm proud to be part of a government that knows a secure home will give more Australians the foundation for a better future. Our comprehensive strategy will create thousands of social and affordable homes across Australia. The housing sector is a complex one, so one strategy is not enough. The Minister for Housing is implementing a raft of strategies to address the housing and homelessness issues across the spectrum. Our strategy aims to increase housing supply sooner but also to provide a pipeline of secure funding for housing developments into the future, because this is an ongoing problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that homelessness numbers jumped between the 2016 and 2021 censuses. We also know housing, both rental and for purchase, is increasingly unaffordable for many Australians, so the responses need to be urgent. But they also need to be effective and evidence based. Ultimately the one thing that ends homelessness is housing. What ends the rental rises is more rental supply—basic demand-supply economics. The Albanese government has a plan that incorporates a number of strategies to address housing and homelessness across the spectrum: more houses, more homes. We recently announced an additional $2 billion in funding, bringing the Albanese government's investment in housing and homelessness to more than $9.5 billion in this financial year. This additional $2 billion needs to be spent or committed by the states and territories within two years and result in a net gain in social housing properties. This is real dollars, driving real change, building more homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all. This commitment builds on the actions we've already taken immediately to address Australia's serious housing shortages: $575 million in funding unlocked in the National Housing Infrastructure Facility and a widening of its remit, with houses already under construction across the country; and the Housing Accord we announced in last year's budget, which includes federal funding to deliver 10,000 affordable homes over five years from 2024. The Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee is already helping thousands of Australians into homeownership. We're delivering new action to help Australian renters, expand opportunities for homeownership and bolster frontline homelessness services. We're delivering a $67.5 million boost to homelessness to states and territories over the next year, and this funding will assist frontline homelessness services across the country through the $1.7 billion National Housing and Homelessness Agreement currently being renegotiated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my career working in the homelessness sector I saw firsthand the inaction by the former Liberal-National government. Their inaction has left Australians with significant challenges across the country. I recently went back to Catherine House, an organisation I led prior to coming to this place, and saw their plans to rebuild and expand. Catherine House, in Adelaide, is a women's homelessness service that provides crisis accommodation and support services for women experiencing homelessness across South Australia. They have plans to expand their homelessness service so they accommodate women currently, right now, sleeping rough on the streets of Adelaide, homeless in the middle of this cold, cold winter. Their plans for Catherine House will directly result in expanded crisis accommodation but also in social housing. I saw their plans, which are ready to go—shovel-ready. All they need is the Housing Australia Future Fund legislation. They need certainty of funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's not just for this development. Social and community housing providers need to be able to plan for the future, for developments next year and the year after, and that is what the Housing Australia Future Fund does. So I'm appealing to the Liberals and the Greens to stop their posturing and do what is right for the Australian people. The HAFF is backed by homelessness services, community housing providers, Shelter Australia, the building industry, developers—the people who actually know how the sector works and what works for homelessness. What makes a difference for homelessness is social housing. When I talk to the sector, they tell me that what they need is certainty of funding going into the future. They are ready to go, shovel-ready; they are waiting for the Housing Australia Future Fund; and they are watching us—watching what happens here in this place and watching those opposite block solutions. So again I say to those opposite: stop standing in the way of more housing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I thank the member for Higgins for this motion. But, while members of the government like to list the ways in which they're addressing the housing crisis across Australia, I want to draw attention to what is largely missing from this debate: housing for regional, rural and remote Australians. The member for Higgins's only mention of regional Australia was the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee, but the member failed to mention what the take-up of the guarantee's 10,000 places actually is. People in the electorate of Indi don't talk to me about this guarantee, and I wonder if one of the reasons is that there simply aren't many homes to purchase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said it before and I'll say it again: in rural and regional Australia we were told, 'Build it and they will come.' Well, they've come and we haven't built it. Regional Australia grew by 70,000 people in the first year of the pandemic. The combination of increased regional migration, rising rental prices, a decline in affordable housing supply and a rise in living costs is having devastating effects. According to the national campaign Everybody's Home, 61.4 per cent of mortgage holders in my electorate of Indi are experiencing mortgage stress. On top of that, 40.6 per cent of renters in Indi are experiencing rental stress. Homelessness rates are deeply concerning. According to the 2021 census, homelessness in our region has increased by 19 per cent since the 2016 census. This housing crisis is happening not just in the cities but in the country areas too, and the government must not forget this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm the first to acknowledge that there is no silver bullet to this problem, but I've been consulting widely on what solutions there could be, and what I've heard is that we need funding for critical enabling infrastructure. I'm talking about poles and pavement, drainage, sewerage. It's not sexy, there's no ribbon to cut, but to build homes in rural and regional Australia we need this kind of infrastructure. Regional areas struggle to attract developer investment to build this infrastructure, and, with big geography and a small ratepayer base, local councils don't have the money to build it on their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Wangaratta there's a perfect example of this challenge. The local council have earmarked a former technical school site to deliver social and affordable and key worker housing in a specialised precinct—to deliver the vision of 200 safe, quality, energy-efficient and beautiful houses for young people, pensioners and essential workers. But they need funding to clear the site, including asbestos removal. They also need to build water and sewerage infrastructure. They then can get going with the building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I've put forward a proposal for government to set up a dedicated regional housing infrastructure fund. This fund would unlock investment in new houses by building the basic infrastructure needed for new multitype developments—private housing, built-to-rent social housing and essential worker housing. It would have the flexibility to fund social infrastructure and provide local government assistance to fast planning approvals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also called on the government to ensure their proposed Housing Australia Future Fund, the HAFF, delivers for regional, rural and remote Australians. I successfully secured amendments to ensure the Housing Supply and Affordability Council could have a regional focus when undertaking its work. So much more could be done to improve this bill for regional Australia, and, with negotiations on foot, we have the chance to do that. I introduced further amendments that would ensure an object of the HAFF is to deliver funding in regional, rural and remote Australia, including funding for the critical enabling infrastructure that I've described.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up these amendments. Rural Australia makes up 30 per cent of our population, provides 90 per cent of the food we eat and brings in 50 per cent of Australia's tourism income. Rural Councils Victoria estimates that, if we don't build the extra homes we need, we could lose up to $1 billion in gross regional product over the next 15 years. That's a call to action if ever I heard one. I know the government is focused on delivering bricks and mortar housing, but funding for the roads, footpaths and streetlights is a key part of this discussion. It's a key part of the solution for regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government, the Minister for Housing and the Prime Minister: help us on this fundamental piece of work that needs to be done in order to unlock housing in rural, regional and remote Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Higgins. It is especially poignant to be moving a motion on social housing now that it is National Homelessness Week. There are a number of events being held within this place over the course of the week, and I'd encourage members to attend if they are able to. This is not to say that I think anyone is in an ivory tower, but, for all of us, it would be worth our time to learn a bit more about the what, why and how. It would give members a wake-up call as to why funding social housing is something that we need to start doing yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of us can see the overt signs of homelessness and unstable housing situations within the borders of our electorates. We know that homelessness isn't just those sleeping rough; it's people without a truly fixed address—those who couch surf, even though to those who don't have a stable housing situation due to short-term periodic leases. Whether visible or not, the effects are felt. It affects someone's ability to keep a job, to send their kids to school on time every day, to find a job and to participate in society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of South Australia, we have a long and proud history of providing social housing, with the South Australian Housing Trust having been created in 1936. It was the nation's first state housing authority, created during the time of a Liberal government in South Australia. Over the long course of history, social housing hasn't been a partisan issue, though—over the course of our history—the extent of its importance has been. Having more stocks of social housing and affordable housing should be an aim of any government, but we know that growth in social and affordable housing certainly stalled over the previous nine years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to necessarily put the causation before the correlation—I doubt we would see any degree of remorse from those opposite when the numbers were put to them, in any case. However, last week we saw the member for Deakin, in his contribution to this debate, ride out of the gates to attack Daniel Andrews. Premier Daniel Andrews may be a mortal, but he is someone who, in the heads of the members of the Victorian Liberal Party, appears to live rent free, even during a rental crisis. I suppose there is room for that now, given the vacancy in their heads now the Greens are again frenemies with the Liberal Party and the National Party. Blocking the Housing Australia Future Fund legislation in the other place with new friends—new old friends—I'd like to hope they aren't blocking the legislation for the same reason, but it does make for a very confused coalition of ideals. One side cares about the issue; the other, displayed over nine years in government, could not care less about social and affordable housing. I remember a time when a Liberal MP could say the words 'Labor-Greens coalition' three times, turn around and expect to see that they had summoned a pair of Birkenstocks; now the footwear of their partnership will more closely resemble boat shoes, I suppose. Whatever the footwear in question, it'll be what they are wearing whilst they run away from their responsibility to the Australian people by blocking much-needed funds into social and affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting a fund in place that provides funds for social housing is important, given we cannot always rely on the better angels of future governments. This is clearly evidenced by the previous government and its lack of care in funding social housing. It had a missed opportunity with HomeBuilder and instead ignored social housing completely. A fund, much like our Future Fund, lasts the test of time and helps to fund unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities. Sovereign funds are not some alien concept. I know the Greens would portray this as playing the market, imagining the Prime Minister in front of his laptop in the wee hours of the morning exclaiming that some kind of digital coin is going to the moon—ludicrous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, by having a fund which generates a baseline funding level for social housing, no matter the party in government, those funds are earmarked for this purpose so we can avoid what we have seen under nine years of Liberal-National government. We can futureproof social housing against the whims of a future Liberal-National government or Liberal-Green government—who knows. There is always going to be a mechanism allowing for a steady level of investment in social housing, and this can only be a good thing. Every penny beyond that will depend on the economic climate at the time and—as history would suggest—whether there is a Labor government in power at the time. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  In rising to speak to the motion moved by the member for Higgins on the critically important topic of the nation's housing policy, I want to offer the observation that Higgins and North Sydney have a lot in common. Like North Sydney, in 2022 Higgins voters felt that the then government wasn't listening to them and in turn they voted to see politics done differently. What this should mean is genuine, transparent and non-politically motivated debate on how to get better outcomes for communities, but, sadly, this has not been the case. In an area as complex as housing, we all need to admit that we won't find perfect solutions overnight, but this should not stop us from being ambitious and having the debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In North Sydney many are facing extreme frustrations in finding an affordable and suitable home to rent or buy. The reality is property prices and lack of availability mean that most people who work in the electorate don't actually live there. Most notably, essential workers, including those in the health and aged-care sectors and teaching sectors, are literally having to travel sometimes up to an hour just to get to work. As a result, not surprisingly, many are taking roles in other communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing has become a fundamental issue of equity between homeowners and renters, between workers and residents and across generations. As I've previously stated in this place, the Housing Affordability Future Fund is a step in the right direction but it's a very small and very unambitious step. Revitalising our public and affordable housing stock is critically important and we need to commit more public and private sector funding towards the challenge over the longer term, but that's just one piece of the puzzle. Other parts of the puzzle include rental property quality and security. In a recent survey we conducted on the rental experience, one of my constituents said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our rental has no heating or cooling, it is damp and we had a mould problem for months. We are often feeling unwell due to the cold. But we can't move because it is too hard to find rentals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent told me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are afraid to bother our landlord with simple repair tasks, such as faulty storage, for fear of reprisal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has proclaimed that it is working with the states' housing ministers to help develop more aligned rental laws that address tenancy rights. However, there is little transparency over this process. Consequently the people of North Sydney remain in the dark about whether those discussions will result in tangible improvements to people's current living situations. I receive complaints from people regularly about substandard rental quality. In this context I ask the government to let the people of North Sydney know how much of this new funding, whether it be via the HAFF or via the housing accelerator fund, will go towards basic maintenance of our existing social housing stock. In the end, efficiency can be just as important as availability and affordability, as we seek to build true equity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 51,000 people on the waiting list for social housing in New South Wales. I am yet to develop any true assurance that this government's policies are going to make a meaningful dent in that number. Building more homes won't be easy. The level of building approvals for new homes is now lower than it has been in 10 years, and home building costs are the highest. We don't have enough skilled tradespeople to meet demand. We must provide the right training to address these shortages and ensure our immigration system brings the workers that we need into our country. These issues are systemic and go beyond the current housing crisis debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For these reasons, housing policy experts have been calling for strategic long-term planning for housing for many years. But this complex ecosystem is full of vested interests. Every time we look at more ambitious changes—be they reviewing tax settings, better aligning transport and service infrastructure planning or raising expectations on developers to guarantee affordable housing—vested interests swoop in and throw their weight around, often leading to a poorer outcome for our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With all of this said, I do support the HAFF Bill and getting the Housing Supply and Affordability Council up and running so that they can look at a range of out-of-the-box solutions and help break the current gridlock. I do not underestimate the size of the challenge ahead. We need to have an honest discussion not dominated by political posturing. Housing policy should be about a safe and adequate home for all, not a political football.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I thank the member for North Sydney, the member for Indi and other members for their contributions, and I thank the member for Higgins for bringing on this debate. I want to address a couple of issues mentioned by the member for North Sydney. Yes, it is complex but it's also simple. When you build more houses, you increase supply. When you increase supply, you bring down the pressure on prices and rents. You also increase the capacity for the quality issues that you mentioned, Member for North Sydney. When you've got more choice in the market, tenants suddenly have more power in the market. Tenants can say to landlords, 'Unless you fix the lighting and the damp, I'm moving down the road to the other rental that has become available.' You can only increase choice by increasing supply, and that's what will be before the Senate: a fund to increase supply by 30,000 new homes in the next five years. It is a fund that will fund housing forever, a perpetual fund. Ten billion dollars is the biggest single housing investment proposed by any government in more than 10 years. Ten billion dollars is nothing to sneeze at. That's in addition to all the other things the government's doing through record rent relief and the help-to-buy and help-to-rent schemes, including across regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that in her contribution the member for Indi called for an expansion of the HAFF, and I think she has foreshadowed some amendments to the bill. To be honest, I'm a bit concerned by what she said—although I think she has good intentions—about expanding the remit of the HAFF to include support for infrastructure like drainage and sewerage. That would chip away at it. We want the HAFF to build houses. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:</span>
                  </a>  Well, if I'm mistaken I'll take that on board, but that's what I heard. I don't pretend to know what goes on in the electorate offices of the opposition or the Greens, but I suspect that it's similar to what goes on in my office, where every single day my staff and I are talking to constituents who are desperate for safe and secure housing. This has traditionally been an issue for state governments. It is increasingly coming to our orbit, and we are determined to tackle it head-on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past few months I've spoken to working families, older women, single parents, grandparents caring for grandchildren, students, and women and children escaping domestic violence. All have stories of spending years on public housing waiting lists—some on emergency housing waiting lists—and making do in the meantime by sleeping rough or relying on friends or family for a roof over their heads. The answer is to increase supply, to build more houses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office staff and I do all that we can to assist each and every one of the people who come to ask for help, but the stark reality is that there are just not enough houses to house people. We've got 4½ thousand people on the housing waiting list in Tasmania alone. The member for North Sydney says there are 51,000 people in New South Wales. We can argue till we're blue in the face about the reasons we got here. I can tell you it's about decades of underinvestment by successive state governments across the nation. But the federal government are not willing to sit idly by. We have a plan of action backed by a $10 billion fund. It's a plan of action we took to the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I simply cannot fathom how members opposite, particularly the Greens members on the crossbench and the Greens members of the Senate, are blocking the bill. They blocked the last bill. We've reintroduced it. We want it to go through. Tasmanian Greens senators Nick McKim and Peter Whish-Wilson need to look homeless Tasmanians in the eye in Homelessness Week and explain why they have been blocking the building of 30,000 homes over the next five years, 6,000 of them to be built in Tasmania, that will put roofs over heads. They say they want cheaper rents. You get cheaper rates by increasing supply. Tasmanian Liberal senators Jonathon Duniam, Wendy Askew, Claire Chandler and Richard Colbeck need to explain why they were happy for billions of dollars to be rorted under their government but they aren't prepared to support billions being invested for vulnerable Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very real human cost to the political parlour games being played by the Greens and the Liberals. It's a cost borne by people who have no roof over their head or who are stuck in a violent home because there is nowhere else to go. This week politicians of all stripes will be going out for Homelessness Week and sleeping rough. That doesn't build houses. It's a nice symbolic gesture. We don't need symbolic gestures. We need the Housing Australia Future Fund passed by the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The corridors of this House are roamed by lobbyists given free rein to talk to whichever politicians they please. Too often they are close and old friends of some of our ministers and staffers, hired because of their personal connections, and useful to corporate interests because they open doors that 99.9 per cent of Australians will never have access to. This is a broken system. The most powerful people in our country spend vastly more time speaking to employees of lobbying firms than they do to people on JobSeeker, to tradies, to students, to small-business people or to refugees. Lobbying firms and powerful corporations are experts at political persuasion. They've figured out how to turn politicians' personal relationships into profit, and the loser is the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public servants and elected representatives must act with integrity, transparency and honesty. In recent decades in Australia we've seen access and influence skew increasingly to the interests of businesses and powerful individuals. Lobbying aims to influence government decisions, such as policymaking, legislation, procurement and grants. Over the past 30 years commercial lobbying in Australia has grown into a lucrative multibillion-dollar-a-year industry. It's hard to think that industry and those private interests don't expect a return on their massive investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a federal level, a Lobbying Code of Conduct applies only to professional or third-party lobbyists placed on a register of lobbyists operating under an administrative code of conduct. That code of conduct is inadequate. In-house lobbyists are not subject to the code of conduct and they're not included on the lobbyists registry. Almost 1,800 in-house lobbyists currently hold orange passes, which give them unrestricted access to secure areas of Parliament House. We don't know who they are. We don't know who gave them access. Only one in four of our lobbyists is actually on our Register of Lobbyists. We don't know who our government representatives are meeting with and we don't know why. Responsibility for monitoring lobbyists activities in Parliament House lies with the Attorney-General's Department, but this is a toothless system. The penalty for any breach of the code is deregistration from the register, but no fine—a punishment approximately as severe as being whacked about the face with a tissue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ministerial and staffer diaries are an invaluable accountability mechanism. They help the public know who has access to our ministers, and they help them to know those issues that are of interest to those who do have access to the ministers. We should know about the timing, the frequency and the nature of representations made to ministers and senior staffers by lobbyists. Ministerial and staffer salaries are paid by public funds. It is difficult to conceive of any rational basis for refusing publication of those diaries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another integrity concern is former politicians, senior political staff and high-ranking government officials leaving office then taking on related roles in the private sector and lobbying on behalf of their new employees—the so-called 'revolving door'. One in four former ministers takes on a role with a special interest group after leaving politics, and nearly 40 per cent of our registered federal lobbyists worked for the government in some role before they became lobbyists—how cosy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lobbying is a legitimate part of the democratic process, but it must be carried out ethically and transparently. Our ministerial standards and the Lobbying Code of Conduct are sketchy, limited and unenforceable. The regime imposes weak rules with no independent oversight and no real punishments for infringement. These rules do not ensure integrity or transparency. It is no wonder that the public has such little faith in the integrity of what goes on in this place and that it fears that influence can be bought in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our electoral act should be amended to legislate a lobbying regime, replacing and expanding upon the current toothless Lobbying Code of Conduct. Administrative responsibility for that code should be placed with the Attorney-General's Department, and the Anti-Corruption Commission should have the ability to investigate breaches of that code. We need more transparency over ministers' diaries. We have to enforce revolving door bans. The people of Australia deserve to have faith in the integrity of their government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  When I decided to run for parliament, to represent the people of Tangney, I was seriously concerned, because I believed that our country faced a challenge. This challenge was one that affected all areas of government. I'm talking about the lack of transparency that the Albanese Labor government is bringing to an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To mention a few examples: I remember a high-ranking official of the Liberal Party involved in shady deals with their former partners. I also remember car park rorts, with the announcement of $121 million later inflated to $300 million, just to benefit political friends. I remember sports rorts that handed out money to applicants that were not the ones that deserved it the most, according to the Australian National Audit Office. But this should not come to us as a surprise. How can we expect transparency from the people led by a super minister—a man that appointed himself as minister of everything?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should consider ourselves privileged. Our constituents deposited in us their faith and their hopes. They expect us to lead this country with integrity, and we cannot betray their trust. I believe in justice, and I believe that those who act against the public interest eventually are exposed. I believe that selfishly putting your own interests above those of our nation comes at a great cost. I would not want to be in their position and have to go to bed with a heavy conscience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government can be proud of being different. In the first year of this government, the National Anti-Corruption Commission was created—an independent body with the authority to investigate any case suspected of corruption. I had the honour to work on this legislation, side by side with many talented, wise colleagues. But even though we have made progress, we still know that corruption is not limited just to public officials. Many will try to take advantage of their personal relationships, their position of influence and their economic power, but we have rules in place to prevent private interests interfering with the development of public policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a Labor government that established the Lobbying Code of Conduct. This way, government representatives can always be aware of whose interests lobbyists represent. Any person who expects to lobby the government on behalf of a third party must be registered and compliant with the integrity and transparency framework set out in the code.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Attorney-General's Department does a good job enforcing this code, including investigating alleged or potential breaches. Under the code, a lobbyist that has committed a serious breach can be barred. Furthermore, if they fail to comply with their obligations they might be removed from the register. The court has been updated recently, with the last time being 2022. Those modifications aim to strengthen the compliance and enforcement options available to the secretary of the department, introduce continuous disclosure requirements and improve transparency where former ministers, advisers and officials are engaged in lobbying activities. Lobbying is not the main concern of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, but, where breaches to the code could consist of systematic corruption, the commission would have jurisdiction to investigate. With the work our Attorney-General's Department does and the National Anti-Corruption Commission in place, we have a solid defence against corrupt interests. That way we can guarantee that the work we do here is for the benefit of all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I'm pleased to rise in support of this important private member's motion, particularly so soon after introducing my private member's bill on restoring trust in federal elections this morning. Both this motion and my earlier bill are consistent with the role of the expanded crossbench in this parliament, pushing for better transparency, greater integrity and more accountability in politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opaque role of lobbyists and the effect on policy are real concerns for a healthy democracy. When conducted in an open and transparent manner, lobbying can make a positive contribution to the development of public policy by ensuring that government understands the consequences of laws. But access is uneven. Not all voices have the money to pay for a lobbyist. Activities that are not transparent can have a negative effect on policymaking and public confidence in government. At the moment, some unregistered in-house lobbyists can wander the halls of parliament and walk unannounced into the offices of everyone, from ministers to backbenchers to crossbenchers, at any time, vastly increasing their ability to exert influence. As the Grattan Institute has observed, policymaking can be distorted if some interests are consistently heard while others are not. The Hon. Anthony Wheely KC, Chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, says it succinctly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Lobbying has become a large unregulated industry. The revolving door sees MPs and Ministers using their connections to further private interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third-party lobbying is currently governed by a code of conduct, with lobbyists listed on the lobbyist register and overseen by the Attorney-General's Department. Under the current system, only third-party lobbyists are required to register. If you're employed directly by a company to influence government and policy rather than through a third party, you're not covered by any regulation. If you can get a parliamentarian to authorise a sponsored APH access card, you can walk the halls of parliament freely. As at 15 February this year there were 1,791 people holding a current sponsored APH access card, with 891 of those passes being issued in the current parliament. Many of these are family members of parliamentarians, but this also includes an unknown number of passes issued by parliamentarians to in-house lobbyists. These in-house lobbyists are able to conduct invisible lobbying activity without any regulation or oversight. The Australian Professional Government Relations Association has its own code of conduct to support transparent, accountable and ethical practice, but not all lobbyists are members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly believe that we need greater governance over lobbyists. The UK and Canadian parliaments and the US Congress have legislated lobbying regimes rather than an administrative code of conduct. The law in those jurisdictions includes arrangements to allow scrutiny of passes granted by parliamentarians. Australia must follow this precedent, particularly in light of the fact that one anonymous parliamentarian in the 47th Parliament has already signed off on 55 sponsored access passes. We have the right to know who is accessing our ministers and our executive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reform should also include extending the cooling-off period for former MPs and senior government officials to three years, in keeping with international best practice, rather than the 12 or 18 months we have here in Australia. It should include a penalty for breach of lobbying rules and regulations. Lobbying misconduct should be punished by denying access to government, including for more minor breaches involving a failure to report on their lobbying activities. I urge the government to consider these reforms to ensure that policy decisions are not unduly influenced by the loud voices of the powerful minority rather than the interests of the Australian public.</span>

                  <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I also rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for Kooyong. Integrity and transparency are clearly important matters for all members participating in this debate. This is not a new journey. This motion focuses on the Lobbying Code of Conduct introduced under the Rudd Labor government in 2008. Currently, the intent of the code is to ensure that contact between lobbyists and Australian government representatives is conducted in accordance with public expectations of transparency, integrity and honesty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The code sets out the requirements for contact between third-party lobbyists and government representatives as well as outlining the type of information that will be available to the public through the register. Lobbyists who do not comply with the code may be removed from the register. The register requires lobbyists to adhere to a number of obligations or risk being completely deregistered if they failed to conduct business with the government appropriately. Some of those principles include:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… not make misleading, exaggerated or extravagant claims about, or otherwise misrepresent, the nature or extent of their access to Government representatives, members of political parties or to any other person … keep strictly separate from their lobbying activities any personal activity or involvement on behalf of a political party … use all reasonable endeavours to satisfy themselves of the truth and accuracy of all statements and information provided by them to clients whom they represent, the wider public and Government representatives …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its current form, the lobbying code allows the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to remove a lobbyist under a wide range of criteria. The code requires government representatives, including ministers, assistant ministers and their staff, most Commonwealth public servants and all ADF personnel, to avoid knowingly and intentionally being party to lobbying activities by lobbyists who are not registered under the code.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The code was updated as recently as last year under the former government. These updates include: strengthening compliance and enforcement options available to the secretary of the department; the introduction of continuous disclosure requirements for lobbyists for any material change to their registrations; and improved transparency where former ministers, advisers and senior officials are engaged in lobbying activities. In addition to these updates, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is currently reviewing the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018, which also regulates lobbying activities. The Albanese government looks forward to the committee's report and will consider any recommendations it may make, including in relation to lobbying activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the last causes of this motion discusses the need to ensure that the National Anti-Corruption Commission can investigate alleged breaches of the lobbying code. Let's for one second appreciate this country now has an established commission. Unsurprisingly, this is something the party of robodebt were unable or unwilling to deliver. This completely independent Commonwealth agency has been tasked with detecting, investigating and reporting on serious or systemic corruption in the Commonwealth public sector. It also has a role to educate the Public Service and the public about corruption risks and prevention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission can investigate the following: conduct of any person that adversely affects a public official's honest or impartial exercise of powers or performance of duties; conduct of a public official that involves a breach of public trust; conduct of a public official that involves abuse of office; and conduct of a public official or former public official that involves the misuse of documents or information that they have gained in their capacity as a public official. The commission was not legislated with the authority and jurisdiction to enforce any penalties under the Lobbying Code of Conduct. To maintain the integrity and mission of the commission, it's critical to avoid the assumption that we can simply assign additional functions and powers to the commission and, by doing so, we can solve an issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Lobbying Code of Conduct was established by the last Labor government to ensure that government representatives who are approached by lobbyists know whose interests they represent. The government expects lobbyists and government representatives to comply with the code. To let this fall under the commission, while well intentioned, would potentially dilute the capacity of the commission and the incredibly important work it's already doing to restore integrity and enhance transparency across the Commonwealth public sector.</span>
              </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  There are more than 3,000 construction businesses and more than 560 manufacturing businesses in my electorate of Macquarie, as well as a number of sandstone quarries, and so it's for the thousands of construction, manufacturing and quarry workers in and around my electorate that I speak in support of the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's now well documented how great the risk of engineered-stone manufacturing is and the horrifying impact that it can have on people exposed to its dust. We've already seen people die from silicosis in this country, people who were otherwise young and healthy. Rates of silicosis and other occupational respiratory diseases are unacceptably high here. These are entirely preventable illnesses and, all too often, entirely preventable deaths. I want every family in Macquarie to know that when they wave goodbye to a loved one as they go off to work in the morning, no matter what the worksite is or whether it's their mum, dad, son, daughter or partner, they're going to see them come home and they're not going to be exposed to deadly silica dust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth comparing the actions that were taken by governments when asbestos was first identified to what we're doing today in these bills. The safety risks of asbestos were first identified in 1898, but it wasn't until the 1970s that meaningful action began. Now, as a parliament, we are not making that same mistake again. We are looking at a range of things that can be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I want to make clear exactly what silicosis is. It is preventable, but it typically has scarring on the lungs called 'pulmonary fibrosis'. Over time, breathing in those tiny silica dust particles triggers an inflammatory response that leads to small nodules growing on the lungs. They can cluster together, causing the lungs to be stiffer and reducing the transfer of oxygen into the blood. In the early stages of the disease, people can have a cough and can be breathless or tired, but they're well, generally. The more the disease spreads in the lungs, the harder it will be for someone to breathe. There is no cure. A lung transplant may be the only option, although much work is being done on new treatments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The incidence of silicosis has really come to light in recent years. When we talk about this dust getting into people's lungs, a lot of it has come from the use of dry cutting in the engineered-stone benchtop industry, where those big slabs of stone are cut to size using handheld power saws and grinders to form those holes for the sink, the taps or the stovetop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That generates the crystalline silica dust which can be released into the air and inhaled. We know that using water in this process can suppress the generation of dust significantly but, until recently, dry processing was by and large the way the industry operated. The Victorian government has done some good analysis, and they have found that almost 70 per cent of workers with silicosis in Victoria indicated they spent more than half their time at work in an environment where dry processing was occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland was the first state to ban dry-cutting in 2018 and Victoria followed in 2019, with New South Wales in 2020, so there has been progress made to protect workers. Around the time the Victorian government brought in its ban it launched enforcement blitz, and WorkSafe Victoria implemented a free screening program for the estimated 1,400 workers in the stone bench industry across the across the state. The findings are interesting. Some 18 per cent of the initial 324 workers who completed the assessments were diagnosed with silicosis. There were similar results in Queensland where, as of February 2021, the government had screened about a thousand stone masons exposed to crystalline silica dust from artificial stone. Some 21 per cent were diagnosed with silicosis, including 32 with the most severe form, called progressive massive fibrosis. These are the sorts of numbers that show the extent of the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting now that I am one of many people who, in organising a new kitchen a decade ago, opted for this product in my kitchen. There are lots of other options to use when it comes to the material of choice for a kitchen benchtop. In Australia, around 45 per cent of the benchtop market is artificial stone—compare that to the United States, where it is only 14 per cent. That is one of the reasons the numbers we are seeing are really quite high. It is worthwhile saying to people—and I would take this advice now had my house burned down this year and not 10 years ago, and were I building a new kitchen—that there are many alternatives that contain little or no silica, like wood, laminate, steel or marble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to where we are as a parliament and the sorts of things we can do to be tackling this very insidious issue. The Albanese government is committed to tackling occupational respiratory diseases and we are bringing in a suite of reforms to ensure Australia's prevention and treatment measures are world-class, protecting workers from unacceptable health risks. The package includes the National Silicosis Prevention Strategy and the national action plan, done in collaboration with health professionals, unions and industry. We're also investing in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve not only that prevention, which is so important, but also the detection and treatment. We are also exploring measures to limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban—that's where individual consumers have the individual choice and can make a difference. We're also working with states and territories to ensure we have a coordinated approach to keep workers safe. This particular bill delivers on the recommendations of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish a National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry. It follows the increase that we have seen, and will capture information relating to respiratory diseases that are believed to have been occupationally caused or exacerbated. It will support the use of the information to understand the true scale of all these diseases in Australia and take action to reduce further exposures in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine, as well as occupational and environmental medicine, who diagnose certain occupational respiratory diseases to notify the diagnosis, the patient and the exposure details to the national registry via an online portal. These physicians may also notify other occupational respiratory diseases, where that individual provides consent—and you're going to hear the word 'consent' throughout this debate because there is a recognition that there needs to be protection of individuals' privacy, and that is embedded in the design of this register. Consistent with the recommendation of the taskforce, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease. The Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to add other diseases to the list of prescribed diseases, following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state or territory. The bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians. We are very mindful that we are asking medical practitioners to do more things, so this limits the mandatory elements that must be notified to a 'minimum notification'. A minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease, the respiratory disease that has been diagnosed and details of the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further additional information can also be supplied where the individual has provided consent, and there are many people that I crossed paths with who want these details to be known because they know that information may provide additional insights into detection, prevention or treatment. That additional information may include relevant medical test results and demographic and lifestyle information, such as their smoking history and employment status. They may want to add details of each job where the individual believes that they had an exposure to a respiratory disease-causing agent. A really good example demonstrates that it isn't only those who are holding the saws and cutting the stone who are affected. We've had a really disturbing case study of a woman who worked in the office of a quarry where she ended up covered in dust every day without having any idea of what the effects of that exposure year after year might be. Being able to capture those details and some of the history of that person might provide really important insights, but each individual will determine what additional details they want captured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to ensuring notified information is available to the physicians treating that individual, the bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about that person that are made to the national registry, including to prescribed Commonwealth state or territory authorities and to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies will increase awareness of the prevalence of occupational respiratory diseases in that state or territory and will enable actions to be taken to reduce further exposure of workers to those diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill recognises that several jurisdictions have registry functions currently in operation and doesn't exclude or limit the operation of any state or territory laws requiring the reporting or disclosure of information around occupational respiratory diseases. Where notification is already mandatory in state legislation, the bill provides for notification of these diseases to occur through the national registry, should the state allow it. This will remove the potential for a physician in those states to be required to notify twice—that is, once nationally and once again on the state register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the national registry will complement actions across all Australian governments to reduce exposures in the workplace and demonstrates the government's commitment to keeping workers safe. That, ultimately, is our goal here. It is really important for those of us who care about our workers. I don't think there would be a single person in this place who would not want to know that, as someone in their community went to work, their work was not leading to them being exposed to something that could be life-threatening to them down the track, so I look forward to the support of this bill by everybody in this place. It is a commitment by the Albanese government that the rights of workers and the safety of workers be at the forefront of our minds. As someone who has run a small business for 25 years and worked with many, many businesses throughout that period, I know how important our workers are, and I know that employers want to make sure they're providing a safe workplace. I hope that this bill will assist in that process by expanding the information we have. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  I acknowledge the contribution of my friend and colleague the member for Macquarie just before me. This National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023 is a bill of great significance and great importance to the health and wellbeing of Australian workers, and it should come as no surprise that this is a bill introduced by a Labor government. I am very pleased therefore to stand in this House and speak in support of the introduction of a new national occupational respiratory disease registry. This is an important bill, as I said, and I would expect it enjoys the support of every single member in this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers on the recommendations of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish this National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry in response to what have been some quite shocking increases in silicosis among Australian workers. Silicosis is an irreversible lung disease, but it is entirely preventable. Tragically it is a disease that is caused by worker exposure to silica dust, and health screening conducted by some jurisdictions in recent years has indicated that nearly one in four of the engineered stone workers who have been in the industry since before 2018 have suffered from silicosis and other silica dust related diseases. That is a most unacceptable statistic, nearly one in four engineered stone workers suffering from some type of exposure to silicosis dust. These are, as I said, entirely preventable diseases and conditions. Not only are they entirely preventable but the deaths are often entirely preventable as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from a region where respiratory diseases have shockingly high rates of prevalence. We know the devastation that is the black lung disease for coalminers, which has reared its ugly head in some parts of Australia again in more recent times, but we have shockingly high rates of respiratory disease across the board. So I am very fortunate to have some of Australia's most preeminent researchers and specialists in respiratory and lung diseases based in Newcastle, and I do want to give a special acknowledgement to Dr Susan Miles, who was recently awarded a terrific acknowledgement from her exceptional work as a clinician but also as someone with excellence in clinical teaching at the Calvary Mater hospital in Newcastle. She was rightly recognised for her outstanding contributions not just to general medicine more broadly at the mater hospital and, as I said, as an outstanding clinical teacher, but also as a very valued member of that team and at the university, and I know she has worked with many other important researchers to understand what is going on with these new cases of silicosis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the work that Dr Miles and Dr Geoff Tyler did four years ago which alerted us to a number of new cases of silicosis. They were saying that there were 18 new cases each month coming through. Their role has been as researchers and medical advisory members on what used to be the New South Wales Dust Diseases Authority—I think iCare has taken over that role. These people have been at the forefront of alerting us to the increased prevalence and, of course, what we can do in order to prevent these shocking statistics from continuing to escalate. It was a real challenge that we didn't understand the size of the problem, particularly in New South Wales, so heartfelt thanks and a very big shout-out to people like Dr Susan Miles and Geoff Tyler, who've done incredible work to bring this to our attention and to really alert us to the dangers related to the exposure to manufactured stone products. They have also made clear just how we can improve the diagnostic work there and the need for something more than just X-rays if we are to truly detect the extent of this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today establishes the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry, which will capture information on respiratory diseases that are believed to have been occupationally caused or, indeed, exasperated. The national registry will also capture associated respiratory disease-causing agents that can lead to the disease, and that's obviously really important information as well. The national registry will capture and share data, where appropriate, on a number of things. I want to step us through what that role looks like. Firstly, it will alert us to the incidence of occupational respiratory diseases and their respiratory disease-causing agents; and the last and main exposures, including the place of business or the industry and occupation and the job task at hand. It will capture the respiratory health data that we need to ensure we have a really accurate picture of what is happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is vital information that will aid in detecting new and emerging threats to workers' respiratory health. It will inform incident trends, which obviously we want to know as far in advance as possible. It will help inform actions to be taken to reduce further worker exposure. It supports, as I mentioned earlier, some really important research that we still need to do in this area into occupational respiratory diseases. I know that doctors and specialists in respiratory disease in my region and the Hunter are very keen to ensure that we have the necessary data to support the critical work they need to do on the frontline of this disease. This information will also assist in targeting and monitoring the effectiveness of the interventions and prevention strategies that we deploy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine, and occupational and environmental medicine who diagnose certain occupational respiratory diseases to notify of that diagnosis and ensure that the patient and exposure details are also part of the national registry, and they will be doing that via an online portal. This is not, of course, unfamiliar to most of our medical specialists in this field already. They are well equipped to start putting valuable data into this national register. And the bill provides for the minister for health to have the power to make rules prescribing which occupational respiratory diseases require notification, and that is consistent with the recommendations of the National Dust Disease Taskforce. They have asked that initially it be mandatory for only silicosis to be reported. However, this power, which would require further consultation before it is executed—and I want to make that clear—will ensure that the national registry can respond to other threats to workers' respiratory health in the future, and I would think that is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we don't have unfettered powers for ministers. There will be a consultation process there. But we do want our ministers to be able to respond in a speedy manner to new data and information coming through. If there are other threats to workers' respiratory health then we would want to be doing everything we can to get on top of that quick smart. We don't want to see long, drawn-out delays like we saw with asbestos and the awareness raising and necessary legislative responses to those shocking implications for workers who, for too long, continued to work with those dangerous products. We don't want to see a repeat of that. Sadly, in Australia we have a lot of experience in dealing with these respiratory issues for workers, whether it's asbestos related, whether it's coal dust related or, now, on the new frontier of silicosis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the bill will allow respiratory and occupational physicians to notify to the national registry information about an individual who has been diagnosed with a non-prescribed occupational respiratory disease where that individual provides consent. The member for Macquarie, who spoke before me, talked about the importance of having consent in all these steps of the process. The bill provides for two categories of information to be notified to the national registry—the minimum notification information as well as the additional notification information. The minimum notification information is that which needs to be supplied to notify the national registry of an occupational respiratory disease. This includes information identifying the individual who has a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease. It requires notification of the respiratory disease itself and details on the exposure, including the last and main points of exposure. These pieces of information are all vitally important in order to get ahead of the spread of this disease and to get better and better at targeting our prevention strategies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional notification information is information that can be supplied where the individual has provided consent. That might include relevant medical test results. It might include demographic and lifestyle information, such as smoking history and employment status, and details of each job where the individual believes they've had an exposure to a respiratory-disease-causing agent. That builds a bigger picture for us all, really. And this bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about an individual made to the national registry, including the respiratory and occupational physicians treating the individual as well as prescribed information to the Commonwealth, states or territories, state and territory health agencies, and work health and safety agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short amount of time remaining, I want to say that this bill does not exclude or limit the operation of any existing state or territory laws, and that is important. For those states and territories that already have laws that require the reporting or disclosure of information concerning occupational respiratory diseases, we don't want to see any exclusion or limitation of that. In my home state of New South Wales we have an existing register that requires the mandatory reporting of some occupational respiratory diseases by physicians. This bill will allow for those New South Wales registers to remain intact, but it will make clear that notification of these diseases will occur through the national register so that there is no need for a physician to double-report—they won't have to report to the state register and then the national register; they will only report to the national register. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  Silicosis is the fastest-growing occupational disease. The rates of this and other respiratory diseases in Australia are unacceptably high. These are entirely preventable illnesses and often result in entirely preventable deaths. In a nutshell, when oil, sand and granite are worked on during blasting, crushing, cutting and drilling in construction and associated industries, such as tunnelling, quarrying and mining, silica is released as a very fine dust. One of the most potent sources of silica dust is engineered stone, used mainly for kitchen benchtops. When breathed in, this dust is small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs, causing irreversible lung damage—silicosis. It's incurable, progressive and fatal. About 600,000 workers are exposed to silica dust every year, with about 350 diagnosed with silicosis and 250 with lung cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June 2021, the Australian Workers Union brought a delegation of silica dust victims here to Parliament House. I met with a 35-year-old mum of two, Joanna, who contracted silicosis after working in an administrative role at a quarry for seven years. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's the unknown that is so terrifying. With silicosis there is no cure, and you just don't know how it will progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Joanna is angry, rightly. She says that she 'should never have been exposed to this disease'. I also met with 53-year-old Kevin, who worked for his company for almost 28 years. He says he wasn't aware that he could get silicosis from what he was doing. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every day, walking around the site, we thought we were OK and safe, but we weren't. For years we had inappropriate PPE, safety rules and regulations. I was even offered second-hand equipment. This should have never happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixty-one-year-old Craig worked at a Victorian quarry for 36 years, until he was diagnosed with silicosis in 2019. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My health, family, work, and finances have been devastated. Silicosis has affected my day-to-day life and completely changed my lifestyle. Life now revolves around going from one specialist to another and frequently visiting the hospital. I feel shattered. I will not be able to see my granddaughter grow into an adult, spend time with my wife and loved ones and be there for my family.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Six hundred thousand workers are still being exposed to silica dust every day. A Curtin University study estimates 103,000 workers will now be diagnosed with silicosis as a result of their current exposure to silica dust. The rate of silicosis will skyrocket in coming years if swift, preventative regulatory and compensatory measures are not quickly adopted. Our government is taking this seriously. We are undertaking a suite of reforms to make sure Australia's prevention and treatment measures are world-class. We must protect workers from unacceptable health risks. We are developing a national silicosis prevention strategy and national action plan. We are investing in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve prevention, detection and treatment. We are exploring measures to limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban, and we're working with states and territories to ensure we have a coordinated approach to keeping workers safe.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we are debating today, the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, and its related bills deliver on the recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish a national occupational respiratory disease registry. This will mean that medical professionals will need to notify the national registry so that we can better understand and manage occupational respiratory diseases as well as monitor the prevalence of these horrible respiratory diseases, which will enable action to be taken to further reduce workers' exposure to risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national registry will capture information relating to respiratory diseases believed to have been occupationally caused or exacerbated and support the use of information to understand the true scale of these diseases in Australia and take action to further reduce exposure. Consistent with the recommendations of the taskforce, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease. The Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to prescribe other diseases following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state and territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians and limits the mandatory elements that must be notified to a minimum notification. Minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease; the respiratory disease diagnosed; and details on the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures. Further additional information can also be supplied where the individual has provided consent and may include relevant medical test results, demographic and lifestyle information, such as their smoking history and employment status, and details of each job where the individual believes they have had exposure to a respiratory disease-causing agent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to ensuring notified information is available to the physicians treating the individual, the bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about an individual made to the national registry, including to prescribed Commonwealth state and territory authorities and state and territory health agencies and work, health and safety agencies. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work, health and safety agencies will increase the awareness of the prevalence of these occupational respiratory diseases and will enable action to be taken as a result of the information we are gleaning from the development of this registry. Where notification is mandatory in state legislation, the bill provides for notification of these diseases to occur through the national registry, should the state also allow that. This will remove the potential for a physician in those states to notify twice—that is, once nationally and once again on the state register. This is important to assist physicians and not overburden them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the national registry will complement actions across all Australian governments to reduce these exposures in the workplace and demonstrates our government's commitment to keeping workers safe, because we are committed to keeping workers safe, as I'm sure all members of this parliament are. We need to do this, and we need to do more. We need to do this for Joanna. We need to do it for Kevin. We need to do it for Craig. We need to do it for their families, and we need to do it for so many more like them that are suffering and to make sure that we can reduce, limit and cease more people and their families suffering in the future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  Every Australian worker has the right to be safe at work. However, sadly, for many years, thousands of Australian workers were unknowingly exposed to enormous risks in the workplace. Since the first Australian case of silicosis associated with engineered stone was reported in 2015, thousands of Australian workers have sadly been diagnosed with this insidious disease. Many spent years, or even decades, cutting and grinding the stone without any meaningful protection or understanding of the dangers they faced, covering themselves in deadly silica dust. The National Dust Disease Taskforce estimated in 2021 that one in four workers exposed to silica dust from engineered stone before 2018 has been diagnosed with silicosis—one in four workers. Such is the danger of the dust and the inadequacy of protections in so many Australian workplaces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact that silicosis and other occupational respiratory diseases have on Australian workers and their families is absolutely devastating. Symptoms may not emerge until years after exposure, and might start as a persistent cough or shortness of breath. However, as the disease progresses, the lungs will continue to stiffen as the silica dust causes inflammation and scarring. Symptoms will progress further to chest pain and fatigue as simple breathing becomes increasingly harder. Sadly, Australians diagnosed with the disease will likely never recover. There is no cure and the effectiveness of treatment is very limited. That's why prevention and early detection must be a priority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry forms a key part of the government's response to the National Dust Disease Taskforce's final report. The registry will keep records of individuals diagnosed with or being treated for respiratory diseases such as silicosis. The registry will enable the analysis of data relating to the incidence of occupational respiratory disease in Australia, which will, in turn, assist with the development and evaluation of preventive measures. This analysis will enable us to better understand the true scale of these diseases in Australia which are often underreported and underestimated, as this disease can take years to emerge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there were 579 Australians diagnosed last year, research from Curtin University estimates that up to 100,000 cases of silicosis may emerge from current silica exposure. Clearly, the scale of this challenge requires very significant action. In order to ensure that comprehensive data is captured, this bill will require medical practitioners to report any diagnosis of a prescribed occupational respiratory disease via an online portal. The minimum notification information will include the patient's identity, the respiratory disease they have been diagnosed with and details about the likely exposure that caused the disease. It is essential that this data is gathered to ensure that we have the best chance of preventing further exposures in the future. More detailed information can be recorded with patient approval, and may include relevant medical test results; demographic and lifestyle information such as their smoking history; employment status; and details of each job where the individual believes they may have had an exposure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also includes provisions to share data with prescribed Commonwealth, state or territory authorities, as well as state and territory health agencies and work, health and safety agencies. This is essential to ensure that all levels of government are fully equipped to take action to reduce workplace exposure to respiratory-disease causing agents. The bill further recognises that some states already have a registry in place and provides for notification to state registries to occur through the national registry, should the state approve. This would remove a requirement for medical specialists to notify twice of any specific case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Initially, the only prescribed occupational respiratory disease will be silicosis. However, there are provisions for other diseases to be added by the Minister for Health and Aged Care as necessary. The establishment of this registry will be a critical tool in the fight against silicosis and potentially other diseases in the future. No worker deserves to be put in a situation where they can contract a deadly, life-changing disease by simply showing up at work and doing their job well. We must act to protect these workers, and understanding where, how and why people are contracting silicosis is the first step. The data from the proposed registry will enable us to answer these crucial questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that this is only the first step. Gathering the data alone will not prevent workers from contracting silicosis. Governments and businesses alike must act on that data. In its final report, the National Dust Disease Taskforce made a series of recommendations beyond the establishment of the registry. These recommendations included the enhancement of work health and safety measures, the development of guidelines to identify people at risk and improve the health screening available to them, improving support for people affected by dust related diseases and their families, and improving the diagnostic capacity of the health sector in relation to silicosis. That is why the government is implementing a range of measures to ensure that Australia's prevention and treatment measures are world class, protecting Australian workers from unacceptable health risks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A national silicosis prevention strategy and national action plan is being developed in collaboration with unions, industry and health professionals, whilst investment is also being made in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve prevention, detection and treatment. Importantly, the government is also looking at ways we can limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, for the power of work they have done to bring this issue to the attention of so many in this place. I would also like to particularly thank the very brave union members and workers who have been diagnosed with silicosis and are telling their story in order to raise awareness. With mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, labourers and admin workers all coming forward, it's clear that this disease doesn't discriminate and that workplace safety practices have been totally inadequate for far too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, while occupational exposure only contributes 1.8 per cent of the overall burden of disease in Australia, in the specific case of silicosis, it contributes 100 per cent. One hundred per cent of silicosis cases are a direct result of exposure in the workplace. That means workplace exposure is entirely responsible for the pain and suffering of thousands of Australians diagnosed with silicosis as well as the hundreds of thousands of Australians who may be diagnosed in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst there is still a significant amount of work to be done, it is reassuring to see this legislation receiving broad support from across the parliament, the union movement and the medical profession. I want to acknowledge the opposition, who established the National Dust Disease Taskforce and are supporting this legislation. I very much hope this bipartisan approach to protecting the rights of Australian workers is continued into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill is an important step in protecting Australian workers from silicosis and providing a framework for protection from similar diseases in future. It's about ensuring that Australians can return home safely from work every single day without risking their health now or in the future. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  I rise to make a few contributions towards the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill and urge the House to support it. I also acknowledge the leadership and the campaign work of the activists in this space and their unions in raising this issue. In quite unfortunate circumstances, people with quite advanced rates of silicosis and other related occupational respiratory diseases took the time to share with us why a bill like this and a reform in this area is needed. Rates of silicosis and other occupational respiratory disease are unacceptably high in Australia. These are preventable diseases and illnesses. Far too often there are entirely preventable deaths if we can just get things right in the workplace and in the health response. We also have the unique opportunity right here, right now, to stop the rise of silicosis and other dust-related diseases from becoming the new asbestos and asbestos-related diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While our government is committed to tackling occupational respiratory disease, I acknowledge from the onset that it is not our job alone—it requires the federal government to work in close collaboration with our state and territory governments as well as with workers, unions and industry. It is essential that the federal government act and take leadership on this matter as it is urgent that we institute measures to lower the exposure of silica dust in Australian workplaces. Colleagues have shared stories of workers coming to tell their tales of how they developed silicosis-related diseases, and those tales are heartbreaking—people who worked with engineered stone, not knowing that cutting and the way in which they cut, and the exposure that they had, would lead to this deadly disease; people who didn't even work with cutting stone—in reception or in accounts—but happened to be in a workplace where dust levels were so high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent modelling by the union movement has shown that, without significant change, 10,000 workers in Australia will be diagnosed with lung cancer related to exposure to silica dust, and 100,000 will be diagnosed with silicosis. Existing safety laws do not provide enough protection for these workers or future workers, and that is why we need to take urgent action. It is good to see that this is bipartisan and that the parliament is working together to ensure that silica dust and silicosis doesn't become the next asbestos. Surveys by the National Dust Disease Taskforce, occupational hygienists and unions show that employers are not doing enough to prevent exposure. More than 70 per cent of occupational hygienists surveyed in 2022 said they were concerned about the overexposure of silica dust in Australian workplaces. Hygienists reported that two barriers to protecting workers were: one, management commitment and; two, lack of financial resource. It's little wonder that we are hearing this—similar reasons were cited during the very slow reform to the asbestos industry over the 1940s and 1980s. I guess that's the point I am trying to make here: we need to act now to prevent silicosis and silica dust becoming the next asbestos and asbestos-related diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are we at with asbestos? I am co-chair with the member for Monash of the Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Diseases. What we hear time and time again in our forums is the legacy that we have. There is so much asbestos that is out in our built environment. It's estimated that one-third of buildings built between a certain period in Australia have asbestos in them. There are homes, there are government buildings, there are schools and there are hospitals, and it's fine until it's disturbed. With so much asbestos in our built environment, a lot of the shift has gone from the workers who installed it to the DIY people who are doing their own work on their properties. It has in many ways become a huge burden on our health system, as we don't quite know who has been exposed and how they've been exposed, and the education campaign in relation to exposing yourself to asbestos dust is enormous. If you think about one in three homes in Australia built in a certain period as having asbestos, that's a huge education campaign to ensure people are removing or repairing asbestos. It could be any kind of work. You could simply be hanging pictures in your house and nailing holes into the wall or sanding back a wall to paint, quite common tasks that all of us undertake, but if it is an asbestos wall you could be exposing yourself to that dust. Due to the fact that it's in our schools and hospitals, trying to remove it in a way that is safe and not to expose people working in that space is so critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity here to get on top of it. Silica dust is quite common, it is fair to say. It is a naturally occurring substance that is part of the earth's crust. We can be exposed silica dust to during mining, tunnelling or road construction. Those are the more natural ways. However, one of the most disturbing ways in which people are becoming exposed and where we are seeing most of the cases of silica dust related disease is with the use of engineered stone. It shouldn't be a surprise. Engineered stone is also known as fake marble out in the community. It has started to be used in benchtops and other parts of finishing off homes. It's a cheaper product, which is why people tend to go for it, but it's also a product that is, to be honest, crap. It's a little bit of stone and then a whole bunch of glue, and I see my colleague across laughing.</span>

                    </a>  It's a technical term. He has probably come across it. We might see it in lots of units or apartments, but whilst it might be a cheaper product to install, the legacy it has can be profound. If the workers involved in cutting and installing that stone haven't done it in a safe way, they are exposing themselves to this deadly dust. Once it is there, it's a bit like the asbestos problem. We need to make sure we are monitoring where this stone already exists, where the engineered stone has been used, because in future renovations and future work, particularly on a home, it may have four or five owners before that stone is disturbed. In apartments it's a similar situation. But once it's there, it becomes a legacy, just like asbestos. I do believe, whilst this is a good first step and we are talking about a national plan, we do need to start to work with the states on looking at a ban on engineered stone because we do need to stop its use to make sure we don't have the same legacies as asbestos.</span>

We want to protect workers from unacceptable health risks like those associated with this deadly silica dust.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investigating an education campaign for employers, workers and health professionals on how to improve prevention, detection and treatment. Treatment is critical for those who have already contracted the disease, and prevention is to ensure that further workers aren't exposed. We are exploring limiting the use of engineered stone, including import bans, as I've just mentioned. I believe it's a step we need to take to ensure that we don't have that future legacy and impose a future burden on future workers, future homeowners and so on and so forth. We're working with the states and territories, as I've mentioned, to ensure that we have a coordinated approach across all jurisdictions to keep workers safe.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers on the recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish a national occupational respiratory disease register. It follows an increase in silicosis in stonemasons working on engineered stone benchtops. Whilst it is a naturally occurring substance, and we do see it in some workers in mining, it is particularly a problem in engineered stone and stonemasonry work because they have been using engineered stone. There is some debate in the industry about whether it can be used safely ever, and that is where the science needs to come in to tell us whether it can be used safely in any way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national register will capture information relating to respiratory diseases believed to have been occupationally incurred or exacerbated, and it will support the use of information to understand the true scale of these diseases in Australia to take action to further reduce exposure in workplaces. This bill will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine and occupational and environmental medicine to diagnose certain occupational respiratory diseases and to notify the diagnosis, patient and exposure to the register via an online portal. Information is key to this. This bill is consistent with the recommendations of the taskforce. Whilst the register will be only silicosis initially, there will be the opportunity for the Minister for Health and Aged Care to prescribe other diseases following consultation with states and territories and the Chief Medical Officer. What's really important is making sure that we're capturing future diseases that we are able to detect.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within this space, I want to acknowledge that, as with asbestos, Australia is a leader in the world. I note that any reform we do in this space will be watched in other parts of the world because they look to us for leadership in workplace health and safety. Just as we've been a leader in asbestos education and awareness, we can be a leader in silica dust reform and silicosis too.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians. We will work to make sure that that burden is able to be managed in a way that is minimal, but the notification is necessary. If we really want to get a handle on how far and how deep this is and how many have been exposed, we need the data. The data is the first step that we are taking in our plan to make sure that we are tackling this deadly disease.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every worker has the right to come home safe not just from injuries that occur in the workplace but from longer term injuries that we quite often don't focus on. We focus on being crushed by equipment and on trying to prevent those instant workplace accidents that may occur, but we do also need to make sure we focus on less obvious incidents, like exposure to dust—asbestos dust, silica dust or any sort of dust that may cause respiratory disease. Far too often, individuals exposed to silica dust may develop silicosis or asbestos and develop mesothelioma but have it dismissed as being from other factors, such as living with a smoker or being a smoker, but we know that's not always the case. We need to take seriously what's happening in the workplace in relation to dust.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Register Bill 2023. When someone goes to work, it's fair to expect them to go home at the end of every day, and it's fair to say that no worker should ever have to suffer from long-term health problems resulting from work that sometimes show up years after the work has been completed. But this is the case for many Australians who work with asbestos or were exposed to the harmful particles and who are now suffering from asbestosis. This is just one example of an occupational respiratory disease. Right now rates of these occupational and respiratory diseases are far too high in this country—unacceptably high. Nobody should go to work and contract such a disease, especially not when it is entirely preventable. Yet it still results in the death of people who were just doing their job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another occupational respiratory disease is silicosis. Not unlike asbestosis, silicosis is a long-term lung disease, caused by inhaling unsafe levels of silica dust and usually developing over a period of many years. People who work with materials like granite, slate and sandstone may inhale a fine dust that contains silica. These dust particles, once inhaled, can scar the lungs. This can make it difficult to breathe and in some cases means the patient will require oxygen to help them breathe. Having silicosis also increases the risk of other health problems, like tuberculosis, lung cancer and chronic bronchitis. It is a high price to pay for a day's work, and no-one should expect this to be the consequence of showing up to work to provide for their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More can be done to prevent these diseases. Workers can be spared from suffering the early death that comes from a disease such as silicosis. That is why our government is committed to tackling occupational respiratory disease and is undertaking a wide range of reforms to ensure that Australia is world class in our prevention and treatment measures and to make sure we are protecting workers from unacceptable health risks. Our work in this area has already started. We are talking to health professionals, unions and industry to develop a national silicosis prevention strategy and national action plan. It is in the interests of all these parties to make sure silicosis is prevented where possible. It will mean that unions and employers are looking out for workers. This will result in a  healthier workforce, and medical professionals will have an eased workload, with fewer cases of this disease—which, sadly, are soaring right now in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with so many issues, education can play a major role in the solution. When it comes to preventing occupational respiratory disease, education is vital. This government understands this and is investing in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve detection and treatment. Employers need to know how they can make their workplaces safer for employees. Employees need to know how they can work in a way that is safe, and they need to understand the consequences if they are not making sure that they maintain safe work practices that prevent these diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important for all medical professionals to be aware of and alert to the existence and threat of occupational respiratory diseases so that these diseases can be detected early and receive the right treatment. We all know there are certain materials that increase the risk of producing the dust that contains silica and ultimately leads to workers contracting diseases like silicosis. One of these materials is engineered stone, which is often imported from overseas. We are exploring measures to limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban, so that materials coming into our country and being used by our workers aren't leaving them with lifelong health complications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not the responsibility of the federal government to be the only soldier in the fight to prevent occupational respiratory disease. The states and territories also have an interest in responding to what has become an increasingly large issue. It is important that we work together so that we can achieve the best outcomes and develop an effective strategy and response. This is why we have been working with the states and territories to ensure we have a coordinated approach to keeping workers safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years there has been an increase in cases of silicosis. This increase has been seen to be largely impacting those working as stonemasons and specifically those who have been working with engineered stone benchtops. This issue led to the recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry, and that is exactly what this bill is seeking to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national registry will play an important role in helping to prevent these diseases. It will capture the information relating to respiratory diseases which are believed to have been caused as a result of someone's occupation, or diseases which are made worse in particular lines of work. We know that this is a big issue in Australia, but before we can act to respond properly and effectively, we need to understand the real size of this issue. That is why the information that will be collected by the registry is so important. This information will be vital to understanding the true scale of these diseases in Australia and will make sure that we are able to take action to reduce further exposures in the workplace. If we can't see the issue and its real size, we can't properly respond. This registry established by this bill will help us to see the issues we are facing so that we are able to act, prevent disease and properly protect workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also gives attention to the important role that medical professionals play in fighting these diseases. It will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine and occupational and environmental medicine who diagnose certain occupational respiratory disease to notify the diagnosis, patient and exposure details to the national registry via an online portal. This makes sense because it ensures that this registry is accurate and seeing the full picture of those being implicated by this issue. These medical professionals are also able to notify the registry of other occupational respiratory diseases where the individual provides consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are many respiratory diseases that can arise from a wide range of occupations, all of which present big risks to people's lives, at this stage we are following the recommendations of the taskforce. As a result, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease. But this is still a huge step forward, and one which is necessary to protect workers, which is what the Labor Party does best. Going forward, that Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to prescribe other diseases following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state or territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know these changes that will require medical professionals to notify the registry of any diagnosis of occupational respiratory disease could create some kind of burden. We want to make sure that this burden is as little as possible by limiting the mandatory element that must be notified to a minimum notification. A minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease; the respiratory disease diagnosed; and the detail of the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures. While it may be a small burden, it is necessary to ensure there are fewer of these cases arising and needing the attention of these doctors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There may also be cases where further information will be provided. This additional information can be provided when the individual has provided consent. This information can include relevant medical test results; demographic and lifestyle information such as their smoking history; and employment status and the details of each job where the individual believes they had exposure to respiratory disease causing agents. This is, again, about understanding the full picture, which will help us to work towards preventing these kinds of diseases from impacting workers in the future, and finding ways to better diagnose those suffering with these diseases and give them the best treatment possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This information will be available to the physicians treating the individual, but the bill also ensures the disclosure of notifications about the individual made to the national registry, including prescribed Commonwealth, state or territory authorities and state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies. It is important that the information is disclosed to state and territory health agencies because responding to the issue of workplace diseases requires us all to work together and, importantly, communicate. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies will increase awareness of the prevalence of occupational respiratory diseases in states and territories and will enable actions to be taken to reduce further work exposure to those diseases. If they aren't aware of the issue, they can't respond. This will mean states and territories will be fully aware of the impact of occupational respiratory disease in their state, which should help them to develop ways to take action against it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">States are not unaware of the issue of occupational respiratory diseases, and many states are doing a lot to act and address this issue. The bill recognises that several jurisdictions have registry functions currently in operation and does not exclude or limit the operation of any state or territory laws requiring the reporting or disclosure of information concerning occupational respiratory disease. This is not intended to override or shut down what is already happening in different states around Australia; this is about creating a combined approach and building onto what is already happening in different states. Given this point, it is important to make sure that this does not create a doubling-up of work when it comes to the requirements of the notification. Where the notification is mandatory in state legislation, the bill provides for notification of those diseases to occur through the national registry, should the state allow it. This will remove the potential for a physician in those states to have to notify twice—once nationally and then again to a state register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the only thing that our government is doing to keep workers safe. We're a party committed to making sure that workers in this country can go to work and provide for their families and do it safely. We're a party that was born out of the interests of workers. We exist to fight to improve the conditions of workers because everyone should return home at the end of their shift. In the case of respiratory disease, nobody should suffer as a result of what they did for work. Workers like stonemasons work hard; they should not have to find it difficult to breathe later on in life because of their hard work. The establishment of the national registry will complement actions across all Australian governments to reduce exposures in the workplace. It demonstrates the government's commitment to keeping workers safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see a future without people who have worked hard all their lives having to pay the price of battling life-limiting disease caused by their workplaces in their retirement. We know that these diseases are preventable, and this bill is about finding the best way to ensure that they are prevented. Retirement should be a reward for a lifetime of hard work; it should not be spent battling the consequences of work, such as occupational respiratory disease. This bill is the first step to preventing this reality, and I commended bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I also rise today to speak in favour of the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023. This bill will establish a national occupational respiratory disease registry that will contain specific information on individuals diagnosed with or being treated for occupational respiratory disease such as silicosis. I would like to firstly talk about the disease I just mentioned: silicosis. Silicosis is a long-term lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust over a period of time. It is a silent killer. The particles, once inside the lungs, scar the lungs—this is what causes silicosis. A one-off exposure may not be immediately noticeable, but a career exposed to quartz, sandstone, soil, granite, brick, cement or engineered stone can lead to irreparable damage. In fact, evidence suggests that workers exposed to engineered stone are particularly at risk, as those workers experienced a more rapid disease progression and a higher rate of mortality, despite being exposed to silica dust for a shorter duration. Symptoms may start to appear in the form of shortness of breath, a dry cough and tiredness. These symptoms become worse with time. Worst of all is the fact that there may be no symptoms at all. Eventually, a silicosis sufferer will find walking and climbing stairs more difficult, and they'll start to notice trouble sleeping and will struggle to eat properly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Australian Unions published the story of Joanna, which encapsulates just how unnoticeable silicosis can be. Joanna, a mother of two and a wife in her early 30s, was working in an administration role for a quarry belonging to a huge, multinational company that manufactured construction materials. Joanna's actual job had little to do with the manufacturing side of the business. In her role, Joanna oversaw things like purchasing and payroll from her office located around 90 metres from the quarry's crushing plant. The dust thrown up by the action of the crushing plant, however, was so pervasive that Joanna said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You could taste it on your lips. Every time you'd go home from work you could actually taste it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her administrative duties, Joanna would also frequently run the safety meetings for staff—sometimes even tasked with taking the minutes. Nowhere in any of those minutes of any of those meetings was she or any other worker for the company made aware of a substance called silica. After returning from maternity leave, Joanna went for her routine medical, as required by her employer. Following an X-ray, she was informed that there appeared to be something on her lungs. A medical biopsy revealed that the 'something' was silica dust. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Joanna was fortunate. For many Australians who are exposed to silica dust and who develop silicosis, their risk of developing tuberculosis, chest infections, emphysema, kidney damage and lung cancer drastically increases. Indeed, the Cancer Council has estimated that approximately 587,000 people had occupational exposure to silica dust in 2011. Based on that number, the Cancer Council estimated that 5,780 people will have developed lung cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know today that silicosis cannot be treated, the damage to the lungs cannot be reversed, and only some symptoms can be properly treated to improve quality of life. It was the union movement that successfully campaigned for a National Dust Disease Taskforce and has lobbied successive governments for action since 2019, when members started to flag with their unions that they were suddenly being diagnosed with scarring on their lungs, and healthy workers who'd had long careers in quarries, construction sites, tunnels and masonries were suddenly struggling to breathe, developing lung cancer despite not smoking, and entering retirement stuck to a chair and connected to oxygen. Unions, fearing another asbestos-like health crisis, commissioned reports and surveys and began lobbying hard for government intervention and better outcomes for their workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was these unions that urged governments to introduce a ban on the use of engineered stone products and that highlighted the need for greater leadership from the federal government to avoid the dust disease epidemic reaching the levels of public health challenge that asbestos had. The ACTU declared:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A failure to take these necessary steps will further risk thousands of workers contracting silicosis, an incurable and sometimes fatal lung disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the coordinated work from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Workers Union, the Electrical Trades Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, and the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union in advocating for their members most at risk of developing respiratory disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In April 2019 the Australian government committed $5 million to establish the National Dust Disease Taskforce to develop a national approach for the prevention, early identification, control and management of dust diseases in Australia. This was in response to the emerging trend of new cases of accelerated silicosis. The taskforce was established in July 2019 and provided some initial advice to the then Minister for Health in December 2019. This advice made 17 findings and five early recommendations. The early recommendations included the development and implementation of a prevention strategy, with an initial and immediate education campaign; the development of a national approach to capture data, information collection and sharing to improve the understanding of occupational dust diseases in Australia, including the staged establishment of a national dust disease registry; and research to better understand accelerated silicosis, with an aim to improve prevention and treatment options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The taskforce provided its final report to the minister in June 2021. This final report made seven recommendations. These included: enhanced work health and safety measures; urgently undertaking regulatory impact analysis to identify and decide on measures for implementation that would provide the highest level of protection for workers; developing guidelines to identify people at risk of silica dust exposure and improving the quality, frequency and coverage of health screening for current and former workers; designing and implementing preventative measures; improving support for people affected by dust related diseases, and their families; improving the supports available for the health sector to improve the diagnosis and management of people affected by silicosis; establishing cross-jurisdictional mechanisms to improve communication and information sharing, coordinate response and report on progress; and implementing the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry as soon as possible, with an initial focus on mandatory reporting of silicosis, and voluntary reporting of other occupational respiratory diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most confronting statistics that was discovered was that nearly one in four engineered stone workers who've been in the industry prior to 2018 have been diagnosed with silicosis or other silica dust related diseases. This legislation recognises the important work that the states and territories have been doing to keep Australian workers safe in following some of the recommendations that were made in the National Dust Disease Taskforce report, and we can see practical examples of these recommendations being implemented. For example, here in the ACT a number of policy changes have occurred to enhance work health and safety measures. These measures include a ban on the dry cutting of engineered stone; a new minimum standard for safety control that will apply for mechanically cutting engineered stone, concrete, cement, bricks, mortar, masonry and natural stone; and that any future cutting of crystalline silica materials is expressly defined as 'high-risk construction work', and, additionally, that those involved in high-risk cutting must complete mandatory training by 1 October this year. These reforms will be enforced through penalties for individuals and businesses that fail to meet the new mandatory requirements, with fines ranging from $6,000 to $30,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry was a key recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce. As recommended by the taskforce, specialists in respiratory sleep and occupational and environmental medicine will be required to notify the registry of every diagnosis of occupationally caused silicosis. They may also notify the registry of other occupational respiratory diseases with a patient's consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will establish a registry that will record the incidence of occupational respiratory diseases in Australia, which will therefore inform activities to prevent further workers being exposed to respiratory hazards. With no cure for silicosis, prevention is our best chance to successfully eradicate this disease for future generations of workers. The registry will have a multitude of functions, including: collecting, storing, analysing and publishing information on the diagnosis and progression of occupational respiratory diseases; monitoring the incidence of occupational respiratory diseases and preventive activities and the effectiveness of these activities; informing the identification of the industries, occupations, tasks and workplaces with a risk of exposure to respiratory hazards; providing prescribed medical practitioners with access to individual patient information on the registry to inform that person's health care for respiratory diseases; and supporting research, including through the identification of individuals for clinical trials and observational studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By being able to track where cases are coming from, how they're being treated and how they're being prevented, the government can use this data to assist with the formulation of a long-term and robust approach to eradicating silicosis and similar respiratory diseases from workplaces. Consistent with the recommendation of the taskforce, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease, but the Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to prescribe other diseases, following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state and territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians and limits the mandatory elements that must be notified to a minimum notification. The minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease, the disease diagnosed and the details and the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures. Further information can also be supplied where the individual consents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to ensuring notified information is available to the physicians treating the individual, the bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about an individual made to the national registry, including to prescribed Commonwealth, state or territory authorities, state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies will increase awareness of the prevalence of occupational respiratory diseases in the state or territory and will enable actions to be taken to reduce further worker exposure to those diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national registry is about empowering and informing the government's long-term plan to eradicate silicosis. This is not something the country can fix in six months, and, due to the slow nature of the disease, the data suggests that numbers will still rise for some time and that the long-term effects will still be present in generations of workers. But the national registry will help formulate our response and will ensure that future generations of workers do not need to fear developing silicosis in their workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the registry will complement actions across all state and territory governments to reduce exposures in the workplace and demonstrates the Albanese government's commitment to keeping workers safe. We cannot cure silicosis, but we can prevent it. I commend this work from the assistant minister and the union movement, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

Silicosis is an irreversible lung disease. It affects workers who are exposed to silica dust—mainly in the construction and mining industries and those working in engineered stone industries. Currently there are no effective treatments for silicosis. Once damage from silicosis occurs, it cannot be reversed. The treatment tends to focus on slowing down progression and relieving symptoms. In severe cases, a lung transplant is required.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Silicosis is said to have been causing death and disability to Australian workers for over 100 years. According to the Lung Foundation Australia, around 600,000 Australian workers are potentially exposed to silica dust each year across various industries. Tragically, these are preventable conditions and often preventable deaths. Everyone has the right to feel safe and protected at work. This government is adamant and passionate about making sure that is the case. Workers should not be exposed to unacceptable risks in workplaces, fall ill or die because their employer failed—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  The heart is often a symbol of vitality and life, but, in some of our First Nations communities, it represents a significant and preventable challenge. Rheumatic heart disease is an issue that has been virtually eradicated from most of Australia, yet disproportionately it remains a harrowing reality in many of our Indigenous communities. A recent request following the tragic death of three women in Doomadgee in the lower gulf area of Queensland underscores the pressing need to direct our focus to these communities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Happy Heart Clinic, Dr Ben Reeves is doing just that. Dr Reeves's colleagues serve as a great example of the hands-on approach we need to deal with the challenges in Indigenous communities and get the dial moving to close the gap and improve health outcomes. By prioritising relationship building, creating a fun environment to allay fears and developing resources tailored to each child's preferences for dealing with injections, the clinic has not only improved attendance rates but also cultivated trust and healed traumas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage the government to take a close look at what Dr Reeves and his team are doing and consider expanding such an issue further so that we can make meaningful improvements to tackling the scourge of rheumatic heart disease. We need real action, not words and certainly no more slogans.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the past two school holidays, the Zonta Club of Gawler has conducted the Gawler Techno Girls school holiday program aimed at girls aged seven to 11 to learn about robotics, programming and problem-solving. These skills are essential to moulding young minds to a future career in a STEM field. Despite this being a fun and educational way for someone to spend their school holidays, the reason behind a program like this is justified when you look closely at the numbers. According to the ABS, out of design, engineering, science and transport professionals in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, only 22.3 per cent are female.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is coupled with the STEM Equity Monitor published last year by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, showing that girls' confidence in STEM subjects is generally lower than boys, and the number falls with age. According to that same report, women make up only 36 per cent of enrolments in STEM university courses and 16 per cent in vocational STEM placements.</span>

Our diverse and rich cultural heritage, coupled with the strength of our democratic freedoms, is something that we must protect. In the mouths of our next generation: Australia is a country that we can be proud of. Whilst Labor, the Teals and the Greens will tell you everything that's wrong with our country, don't believe them. Stay the course. It's the best country in the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The Hunter is filled with great young athletes competing in a range of sports. I rise today to recognise and congratulate athletes from Macquarie Hunter Athletics who participated at the 2023 Australia junior championships in Queensland in April this year. As expected, these young Hunter athletes cleaned up and took home a bag full of medals—because that's what we do in the Hunter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under-13 athlete Tayla Bryant took out silver in an amazing run in the under-14s 200 metres. Tayla also came first in the 4 x 100 metre relay and fifth in the 100 metres. Noah Tonga came second in the under-14s hammer throw—and if anyone here has done that they'll know how hard it is. Keira Carlson took home the silver in the under-15s 400 metres with a great performance. And under-17s athlete Shari Hurdman got the silver medal in a very close 200 metres finish. Shari then took the step up into the under-18s and won bronze in the 400 metres, along the way running a Commonwealth Youth Games qualifying time. Well done, Shari!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to Tayla, Noah, Keira, Shari and all from the Hunter who participated in this event. You have done us proud back home in the Hunter. Keep working hard. I can't wait to, hopefully, see you compete in the 2032 Olympics in Brisbane.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  They may be called the hidden homeless, but given it's homelessness week I want to draw attention to the disturbing increase in the number of older women experiencing poverty and homelessness. Recent data shows that half of the older women living in private rentals in Greater Sydney are living in poverty, and, according to the 2021 census, two out of five homeless individuals are women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But women don't often present as homeless individuals or rough sleepers, instead couch surfing, house-sitting, sleeping in a car or relying on help from friends and family, so all too often their circumstances are overlooked. Most of these women have never been homeless before and find themselves in this situation because of an unavoidable life event, like the death of a partner, a relationship breakdown, illness or early unemployment. As women tend to live longer, be paid less, have less superannuation and take more time out to care for others, the situation is only exacerbated over time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some cases, these women can access public housing or other resources, and I applaud the work of organisations such as Housing for the Aged Action Group, but in truth there is much more that can be done. Policies that provide long-term certainty and support for all older Australians, particularly women, are within our power to enact. I call on the government to ensure the national homelessness strategy has an explicit focus on older Australians, for those who have contributed so much to our nation deserve no less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I am deeply saddened by the passing of Chris Baker, a North Ward councillor of the City of Wanneroo in the federal seat of Pearce. Chris had a profound commitment to community welfare and sustainable development. He championed projects aimed at enhancing local infrastructure, promoting green space and encouraging civic engagement. His unwavering dedication and tireless efforts in his role as an elected member have left an indelible mark on the community he served.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris was committed to improving the lives of the community, and his legacy will continue to inspire generations to come. He approached his responsibilities with a fierce determination, never hesitating to stand up for what he believed in. His tenacity in addressing critical issues was a testament to his strong sense of duty. This was recently very evident when he cut short his family holiday so he could attend a special meeting of council last week to speak passionately in support of the Quinns Mindarie Surf Life Saving Club and the surrounding residents fighting to preserve the beach foreshore for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether he was advocating for better infrastructure, promoting local initiatives or championing the voice of the community, Chris's impact was profound and lasting. He represented his community as a Joondalup MLA from 1996 to 2001, a Joondalup councillor from 2001 to 2004 and a City of Wanneroo councillor from 2019 to 2023. Chris was a devoted husband, father and grandfather, and I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Sarah, his children and his grandchildren.</span>

That means people copping unfair rent increases are being evicted for absolutely no reason at all. What we know is there are millions of renters one rent increase away from joining that number, and that's people like Anna, a renter who sent me this message:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm a single working mum of one. A girl with special needs. After I pay my rent and spinal therapy sessions for my daughter, I barely have $100 left after all my bills to live off for a fortnight till next pay. I just found out my rent will go up in September and it's the most stressful and exhausting feeling a mother can have. I'm not a glass half empty person, but to live in the so-called lucky country where I will be homeless very soon is very scary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Property investors will get half a trillion dollars worth of tax breaks from this federal Labor government in the next decade, and what do renters get? Basically nothing except the fastest rent increases we've seen in 35 years. There are now 80 housing, legal and welfare organisations who have joined the Greens in calling on the federal government to coordinate national caps on rent increases and proper renters rights: 75 per cent of this country now support national rent caps, including 68 per cent of Liberal voters and 80 per cent of Labor voters. How many more people like Anna are going to be evicted onto the streets before this government pull their finger out, do their job and represent the one-third of this country who rents?</span>

The best of Western Australian culture will be on show, with two performances by the WA Symphony Orchestra playing a mix of classic string quartet pieces and contemporary Australian arrangements. Co3 Contemporary Dance will be performing a piece titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Carnivale</span> by the award-winning artistic director Raewyn Hill, and we will be showcasing the amazing foods and drinks produced in Western Australia. Thanks to the support from the City of Swan, for example, we will have many amazing businesses and wineries from the Swan Valley of my electorate of Hasluck, including Sandalford, Limeburners, Nikola Estate, Sittella estate and Old Young's Kitchen; then we will have beautiful food from the House of Honey, Morish Nuts, Whistler's Chocolate and Mondo Nougat, a local business that will be holding a nougat-making masterclass at their booth. Showcase WA will also be featuring exhibitors from the resources sector, tourism, education, defence industry, environmental conservation, local and state governments, business and agriculture. </span>

According to the RAC, there have been 31 crashes and countless near misses at the local blackspot in Sorrento. A recent RAC survey nominated the intersection as Perth's most hazardous. I have been working with concerned members of the local community towards a solution, including Sacred Heart College. I recently met onsite with members of the Sorrento community to hear their concerns. Whilst talking to residents I met 20-year-old Kirby Dees, a local resident who sustained a broken wrist in an accident at the intersection whilst on her way home. I've launched a petition that has already been signed by hundreds of concerned residents, and I call upon the federal government to provide the necessary road safety funding required to install a roundabout or a set of traffic signals at the intersection as a matter of urgency. Failure to act on this matter will only result in more accidents and more injuries to the local community.</span>

Decades of evidence have shown that financial pressures from cost-cutting in transport supply chains squeeze operators and drivers and cause dangerous pressure to delay maintenance, meet unrealistic deadlines or stay on the road too long. This year alone has seen the collapse of Scott's Refrigerated, Rivet Mining Services and Milkrun in the face of incredible pressure from wealthy clients making extraordinary profits while squeezing transport contracts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far this year, more than 100 people have died in truck crashes, including 29 truck drivers. Twelve food delivery riders have been killed since 2017. In the last financial year, there have been close to 200 insolvencies in the trucking industry. As Michael Kaine, the National Secretary of the TWU, has said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This crisis in transport affects the entire industry, from gig workers to owner drivers under pressure to drive longer and faster, to employers faced with cannibalistic, unfair competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, when the Road Safety Tribunal was abolished, the gig economy barely existed. Now it's a deadly additional factor to the supply chain pressures in this industry. It's time to pass reform to make road transport safer, fairer and more sustainable and ensure lives are protected.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I refer to recent polling on the Indigenous Voice to Parliament. We saw from RedBridge polling last month that the 'no' campaign was leading 56 to 44, and, worse for the 'yes' campaign, when people had read both official pamphlets that increased to 59 to 41. What was once an issue of a lack of detail for the 'yes' campaign has become an issue of the presence of detail: the more people find out, the more they reject it. I see Newspoll is now showing that there is a majority in neither the popular vote nor the state vote for this. Australians are divided on the issue of race, and I think this is a terrible outcome. No matter where you stand on the issue, it's terrible to see us divided on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is one place where there is 100 per cent support for the Voice, and that's where Labor and the Independents meet. I can't hold it against the Labor members. They're told what they have to do. They can't object to their position. But the Independents have chosen to be Labor's voice in their electorates, and you have to ask why they're doing this despite popular support falling. Popular support is falling, and yet they continue to insist on being Labor's voice. That's because they're not here to represent you; they're here to change you. That is the Independents' view. They came to this place pretending to be great community advocates. They've been revealed to be nothing more than Labor's voice in their electorates. I'm very proud to represent my electorate and the views of my electorate, and I'll continue to do so.</span>

By my count, there are at least 56 venues across Boothby holding exhibitions this year, ranging from community and commercial art galleries, cafes and restaurants through to community centres. On Friday night, along with Emily Bourke MLC, I attended the opening of the Tutti Arts exhibition entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Mavericks </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nd Biscuits</span>. This inclusive art studio tags its exhibition as an opportunity to 'revel in unconventional, progressive art from artists who are not afraid to take risks'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crowd was escorted around the exhibition by performance artists Kurt Bosecke, Mathew Leigh-Tamblyn and Dougie Jacobssen in character, and we were treated to a large range of artworks, from paintings, drawings and sculptures to T-shirts, digital art installations and much more. True to the exhibition's title, there were biscuits as well. The standout pieces included some digitally enhanced pictures that move when viewed through an app, by Matthew Cawthorne, Michael Tye, Banjobe Hunt, Lewis Constantine, Jenna May, Hannah Ryles and Kimberly Sellers. And there were some crocheted puppets by Jordan Allard that I'm sure would have inspired even the member for Cowan, who we know is an avid crocheter.</span>

As one of the greatest sons of Parramatta, he was also integral in ensuring the growth of this community and seeing many of the important community developments that we have seen over the years blossom into a great centre for Western Sydney in the heart of New South Wales.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Recently I held a housing crisis forum in my electorate. I invited a cross-representative group of stakeholders to come and talk to us about what they're seeing, what they're experiencing and what action they'd like our government and this parliament to take. In attendance were not-for-profit organisations like Haven Home Safe and local community health services like the Bendigo Community Health Service. We also had our local government—the City of Greater Bendigo—and our local real estate agents attend. I mention local real estate agents because of what they said clearly and loudly to the group: 'We cannot supply all the rental properties that people in Greater Bendigo need. Yes, we are a critical part of the private rental market, but we cannot do it alone.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They agreed with the rest of the people who participated that we need more social and community housing and that we need more supply to help solve the housing crisis not just in my electorate but across the region and across Australia. What they also said, which I thought was really interesting, is that this has taken decades to occur, that the legacy of the Howard-Costello years is finally starting to really impact in our local community. The funding cuts to the federal government contribution to social and community housing are really starting to hurt. I urge this parliament to take on board these local experiences.</span>

Members came together for the final meeting in June attended by Robyn Spruce who has served on the executive for the past two decades as secretary and president. Also present was Deborah Jaynes who served as treasurer; secretary Barbara Thorley; and other long-serving members: Betty Braithwaite, Edna Fuller, Margaret Evelyn, Marj Glasby and Noela King. Thank you, ladies, for your service and contribution to the community. You'll be sorely missed.</span>

It's a shame that the opposition leader didn't attend this year. But Senator Price was asked about the leader's non-attendance on <span style="font-style:italic;">ABC News Breakfast</span> this morning. Journalist Michael Rowland said, 'Was it wrong of Peter Dutton to not at least go to Garma to argue his case?' Senator Price replied: 'Look, I don't think so. Mr Dutton has been to Garma several times already.' Several times! This time mum was cooking a lamb roast, but he's been several times before. Then, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Saturday Paper</span>, there was another sighting. Paul Bongiorno says, 'The opposition leader who has attended Garma in the past will instead be campaigning for a rejection of the Voice.' There was another sighting of the opposition leader at Garma. He's like Elvis. People are seeing him everywhere at Garma.</span>

Scott Morrison has been to Garma. They've all been to Garma. The Leader of the Opposition's absence from Garma is so conspicuous and so preposterous that even his own minister can't quite believe he's never been there.</span>

But I say to those Australians: 'Do not be troubled because the man charged with solving these problems, the Treasurer, is a big Labor thinker.' He was kind enough to point this out to us when writing his dazzling essay in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Monthly</span>. He gently reminded us that other big Labor thinkers have done the same thing—Kevin Rudd in February 2009 and Wayne Swan in March 2012. He cited the timeless wisdom of a Greek philosopher: 'No man ever steps in the same river twice.' If he'd told us that no man or woman ever gets an interest rate increase twice, that would have been a lot more comforting, but he couldn't actually say that, because they've had 11 of them in a row under this government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But do not worry about these minor details, I say to Australians. Read the Treasurer's essay. Print it out and carry it around with you. Memorise it. Repeat it. It will comfort you. I say to Australians: be awed and amazed by the limitless power and ambition of this remarkable man, a man with big plans. His to-do list includes 'redefining and reforming our economy and institutions' and 'reimagining and redesigning markets', but my favourite is the one he promises to get done this year: 'building a better capitalism, uniquely Australian'. So be of good heart, Australians. In less than five months, this mighty task will be complete. If your house is repossessed or your electricity is cut off, take comfort that we have a big Labor thinker.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Identifying as Aboriginal has brought and will always bring a sense of pride to me and my family. Growing up as an Aboriginal that might look a bit different, I was often told by others that I had two paths to walk, but neither of them could ever meet, let alone be mentioned in the same sentence. But I chose to walk them together. I chose to be proud of my culture, and I still am proud of my culture. I will continue to walk these paths. I will not let ignorance define me, and I will not let it define my family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has taken the time to understand me as a person knows that, above all else, I value family. My grandmother Aunty Robyn, of whom my community hears me speak so fondly and frequently, is a proud Aboriginal Mingaletta elder and a woman of Wiradjuri descent, and she sits up in the Speaker's gallery today. She is one of the kindest, most accepting, pure-hearted people that anyone could ever hope to meet. As a well-recognised and accepted elder of Mingaletta, she gifts our community the knowledge, culture and education to safeguard the past, focus us on the present and inspire us to look to the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of my Aboriginal heritage, and the desire to strip someone of this pride is something that I will never understand. I am of Wiradjuri heritage. I am of the Mingaletta community. I am Aboriginal. My family is Aboriginal, and we are proud.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  Yesterday I had the privilege of going to the Chinese community roundtable. At that meeting was a man named Minwen Wu. He has founded a group called English Corner, which takes its inspiration from Speakers' Corner in England. Speakers' Corner in England has a history that goes back 250 years. It's had speakers such as Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and George Orwell—speakers very familiar to all sides of this House, and some appear in essays that we've seen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this corner, which is at Box Hill, is for people to stand on their feet and practice English. We often take for granted that we can speak English from birth. We learn it from our parents, not from birth. Even though I was a migrant, I came here knowing English, but so many in my community don't know English and have to learn. There is no better way than standing in front of your peers and explaining what it is you stand for and what it is you are passionate about. I want to commend this group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They meet every weekend in Box Hill. I encourage anyone in the Box Hill area to go and meet them and to listen. I did, and they don't just practice English. They speak about politics. They speak about our community. They speak about our environment. They speak about a better Australia, and I encourage us all to attend. I thank the organisers for putting on such a wonderful example of our communal language, and I commend them.</span>

The sisters-in-arms have lived their culture for months in preparation for what they are going to bring home to this country when they get on the planes from Cape Town. I'm incredibly proud. Like netball tragics around the country, I was up at 2 am to watch them defeat the old enemy, England, and didn't they do a good job! It would be remiss of me not to mention a three-goal win against the Sunshine Girls, Jamaica. It was an incredible game of netball. They are incredible sportspeople, and it's an incredible sport. I'm so, so proud. Their business is finished. Matildas, we're with you till it's done. Good luck tonight!</span>

Beating England is particularly satisfying. The Diamonds won 61-45 to once again win the Netball World Cup in South Africa. We all know that diamonds are formed under pressure. What you get at the end of the process is the toughest gem, and that's exactly what the Diamonds have been. They are world beaters and absolute inspirations. Congratulations to their captain, Liz Watson, and the entire team!</span>

Prime Minister, Australians are witnessing an incompetent government that can't explain its plans for a voice, can't deliver its promised $275 annual cut to energy bills, has presided over 11 interest rises in over a year, and has no concrete plans to rescue families from our worsening cost-of-living crisis. When will the Prime Minister get across the detail and start prioritising ways to help families struggling with cost-of-living pressures?</span>

The Leader of the Opposition speaks about the economy, social policy and a whole range of matters, and I'm happy to go through them. The unemployment rate now is 3.5 per cent; it was 3.9 per cent when we came to office. The participation rate is 66.8 per cent, up from 66.4 per cent. The gender pay gap is down from 14.1 to 13.3 per cent. The number of women employed full time is up from 3.6 million to 3.9 million. The number of long-term unemployed is down from 122,000 to 100,000.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to industrial disputes—this is a good one, Mr Speaker—there were 128,000 days lost in the June quarter of 2022. Do you know what it is for the March quarter, which are the last figures available? It's 7,700. Remember the industrial relations legislation and the catastrophising of those opposite. There were 128,000 days lost under them and 7,700 lost under this government. Inflation figures, we know, were at the highest this century. It was 2.1 per cent in the March quarter of 2022; in the June quarter of 2023, it was 0.8 per cent. Annual wage growth has risen from 2.4 per cent to 3.7 per cent. The wholesale electricity price was $264 a megawatt in the June quarter of 2022; now it's $108. Gas was at $31.76 in May 2022; the August average is $10.73. Private business investment was at 10.8 per cent in the March quarter of 2022; it's at 11.3 per cent today. And of course the humdinger: the state of the budget—a $78 billion deficit under them; under us, a surplus of around about $20 billion.</span>

I've said for a long period of time now that we will co-operate with China where we can, we'll disagree where we must and we'll engage in our national interest. The decision by China to remove the 80.5 per cent antidumping and countervailing duties on Australian barley should be welcomed by all Australians. This is a decision that is good for Australia, but it's also good for China, because they get access to the best barley in the world—the best barley in the world. These duties had effectively blocked barley exports worth over $900 million. This is a decision that's good for our economy, good for agriculture and good for jobs—and I'm sorry that it's opposed by some of those opposite. One in four Australian jobs are in exports. Jobs in export industries have higher-than-average pay. Trade contributes 30 per cent of GDP. And China is by far our biggest export market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The result is the culmination of more than a year of work, and I want to pay tribute in particular to Don Farrell, the trade minister, and also Penny Wong, our foreign minister, for their calm, consistent, responsible approach, standing up for Australia's interests. They have had a sustained engagement. Our approach has been serious and sustained. We have continued to speak up for Australia's national interests and we will continue to do so—on human rights and on the need for economies and the rule of law to properly operate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do say that there is an interest in China receiving our goods, just as there is an interest in Australia exporting those goods. It is in Australia's interest to have a stable bilateral relationship with China, and we made it very clear that we were open to dialogue. I met with Xi Jinping in November last year, and I'm sure we will potentially meet again on the sidelines of the G20 meeting that is coming up in the future. I have also overseen a ministerial engagement, including between foreign ministers, trade ministers, defence ministers and others. We have made progress without shifting any of our fundamental positions on trade, on security or on regional stability. We'll continue to do so, by having respectful dialogue. That's in the interests of Australia's farmers. It's in the interests of our national economy. It's also in the interests of security in the region that we have constructive dialogue.</span>

On <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> yesterday the Prime Minister failed to explain the expenditure three times. Prime Minister, what has this money delivered?</span>

She is a great regional MP who understands just how important our agriculture sector is to the nation's economy. Of course the Albanese Labor government continues to back our agriculture sector. We know how important it is to ensure that our farmers, our processors and our exporters have the best possible access through the removal of trade impediments imposed by our trading partners while restoring the relationships with trading partners that the Liberals and Nationals frankly spent a decade trashing.</span>

                  </a>  The shadow might like to listen. This represents years of hard work from Australian government officials and industry. Australia has successfully use of the rules based World Trade Organization dispute settlement system to respond to, resolve and address these issues. We welcome China's decision to remove duties on Australian barley and have made clear to China we expect a similar process to be followed to remove duties on Australian wine. We are confident of a positive outcome.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, the Albanese government has been working hard to stabilise our relationship with our country's largest trading partner. China's decision to remove duties on barley is the latest in a series of decisions we have been able to secure from China to remove trade impediments on our agricultural products. Already, over the past couple of months, we have managed to successfully negotiate the removal of impediments on cotton, timber products and horticultural products—something I would have thought those officers would be welcoming. This is a feat that they could not achieve when they were in government. While the decision on barley is welcome, there are a number of products—in particular, wine and beef—that are still subject to impediments. We will continue to work hard to stabilise the relationships with trading partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is steadfast in its support of industry's ambition of $100 billion by 2030, evident in the significant market access wins secured since we came to office. Last year alone we recorded 107 market access achievements where access was established, improved or restored, and that is worth over $5.4 billion to our agricultural sector. We will continue to work hard to pursue Australia's interests on behalf of the agriculture sector to ensure that we have the best possible international access.</span>

Minister, the banking royal commission's report was tabled more than four years ago, but still at least 18 recommendations are yet to be implemented. Obviously this is unacceptable and out of step with community expectations, not least because the misconduct discovered by the commission and the harm it caused was extremely alarming and is likely continuing to some degree. Minister, when will all 76 banking royal commission recommendations be implemented in full?</span>

He was also a passionate campaigner for the introduction of a royal commission into financial services, something that the Labor Party supported in opposition and the coalition voted against 26 or 27 times.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 76 recommendations from the royal commission. Of those, some 54 were to government, another 12 were to the regulators and 10 were to industry. I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that in the first 12 months of the Albanese government we have implemented a key recommendation that was outstanding from when we came into government, and that was the implementation of the compensation scheme of last resort. I say it's important because, upon coming into government, there were around 2,000 people who are owed an award of damages that was unable to be paid and would have otherwise been paid by the compensation scheme of last resort. About $230 million worth of compensation payments will now flow because in the last month that legislation passed through the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also inform members of the House that, of the six outstanding recommendations to government, five can be passed this week if the financial accountability regime passes through the Senate. I believe it's on the Senate's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> to be considered this Wednesday, and I'd urge the Senate to ensure that that does occur. The final recommendation to government that I haven't dealt with so far deals with point-of-sale exemptions in relation to certain credit products. I propose to deal with that in the context of the buy-now pay-later reforms that I hope to bring into the parliament if not late this year then early next year. I think that would be a very important reform.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I could point to the other recommendations, my understanding is that there are two recommendations to the regulators that remain unresolved. Both of them require other processes to be dealt with. For example, one of them requires the implementation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quality of advice review</span> and other associated processes that I'm busily dealing with the regulators, the department and the regulated industry on. In relation to the industry, my understanding is that there are three outstanding recommendations. One's a bit hard to measure because it deals with the change of culture within the industry. The other two deal with not yet time expired reviews of codes of practice within the industry. I can inform the member and the House more generally that we're committed to ensuring that all of this is done. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:21</span>):  I want to thank the member for Lyons for his question. We too came into the parliament at the same time, in 2016. He's a great Tasmanian representing the great people of Lyons. I also want to acknowledge how grateful I am to represent Senator Farrell here for this question. He is a great South Australian, who, by his deeds, is proving to be an exceptional trade minister in the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many in this chamber know and as has been referenced before by the Prime Minister and the minister for infrastructure, in May 2020 Australian barley producers copped an 80.5 per cent tariff when exporting barley to China. That has led to an almost $1 billion a year loss to those grain growers around Australia because the duties effectively blocked the export of that barley to the Chinese market. That is why the news that came out last week that the Chinese government will no longer be imposing these duties on Australian barley is so welcomed by the industry and of course by all Australians. There are presently 126 exporters registered to supply barley to China, who will again have access to the significant market after three long years. This is also great news for Chinese consumers, who will now be able to enjoy better beer brewed using great Australian barley—the best barley in the world, as the Prime Minister has commented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being elected, the Albanese Labor government has been working constructively with the Chinese government to address a range of trade related matters which arose during a long period of diplomatic silence overseen by those opposite. As part of this constructive approach, in April China initiated a fast-track review of the barley industry following agreement between our two nations to suspend the WTO dispute on barley. Now, following Friday's announcement and consistent with the terms of that agreement with China, Australia will discontinue that WTO dispute. This is a great outcome, which demonstrates the approach adopted by the foreign minister and the trade minister of engaging in sensible dialogue and negotiation, which is delivering timely results for Australian industry. The reality is that, if we had pursued this dispute through the World Trade Organization, barley producers would not have had a resolution for at least another 12 months, and that is entirely unacceptable for a $1 billion a year industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know growers were devastated by these tariffs. At the time, barley was one of the top 3 agricultural exports in the country. Other markets were pursued, such as Mexico, because, of course, they brew some good beer over there too, but none could match the geographical proximity of the Chinese market for barley nor the population. This decision has been celebrated by stakeholders. I want to acknowledge the support of National Farmers Federation Chief Executive, Tony Mahar, who said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge the hard work by the Albanese Government to stabilise our relationship with China—in particular Minister Watt, Minister Wong and Minister Farrell who have engaged constructively with their counterparts on this issue.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, that was potentially the most absurd point of order I have ever heard. The last words that the minister said were 'the government has allocated'. It was at the moment of saying 'the government has allocated' that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in a prepared point of order, stood up simply to interrupt. It is an attempt simply to interrupt the minister, not to raise a point of order, because the exact words that were being used could not have been more relevant.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, the government has allocated funding for a Makarrata in line with the commitment that we took to the last election. The funding has been allocated for the NIAA resourcing to progress our commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, but we are not establishing a Makarrata before the referendum. Our priority is Constitutional recognition through a Voice.</span>

Could that be because inflation is moderating in our economy, our jobs market has been particularly resilient, and we are handing down the first surplus in 15 years—something those opposite were incapable of?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that people are still under pressure, and in the face of the shadow Treasurer's embarrassed indifference, our highest priority is rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief and creating good, secure well-paid jobs for more of our people. In the face of pressures coming at us from around the world and being felt around the kitchen tables of this country, our labour market has been a source of resilience and a source of strength. Australians have every right to be proud of what we have achieved together over the past year and a bit: 14 million Australians in work for the first time ever; the population share in work the highest ever; the unemployment rate now 3½, down from 3.9 at the election; and women's participation at near-record highs as well. The most recent data confirmed half a million jobs had been created in the first 13 months of the Albanese government. Thirteen months is the shortest period for any new government to reach this mark on record. It took those opposite 34 months to create half a million jobs. It took Mr Howard's government 45 months. That's more than three times longer than it's taken us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the outstanding performance of our labour market and our people, we know that high but moderating inflation, higher rates and global uncertainty is expected to slow the economy and push up employment in the months ahead. Both the RBA and the Treasury forecasts have unemployment ticking up over time. But this is a remarkable starting point as we enter a new period of uncertainty from a position of relative strength. It's also prompted a welcome and important focus on full employment and how we manage and maximise opportunities for more of our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first priority of the employment white paper that we will release in the coming months will be finding some common ground on full employment and, in the process, laying out our plans for job security and wages and productivity and skill shortages and addressing the barriers that people confront, even with unemployment, with a three in front of it. As pleased as we are with the progress that Australians have made together, we know that there is more to do to ensure that people who work hard can provide for their loved ones and get ahead. This is a central feature of our responsible economic management. We're making progress, but we know that there's uncertainty ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:35</span>):  I thank my friend the fantastic member for Pearce for her question. Australia is the best country in the world. There are lots of reasons for that, but one of the reasons is that we look out for each other. Think about when there's a bushfire or when there's a flood: we get together and we help each other out. Mateship isn't some kind of made-up national myth. It's what we do and it's who we are. We don't leave our mates behind. But there are a group of Australians who are behind. If you're a young Indigenous person today, you're less likely to go to preschool, you're more likely to fall behind at primary school and you're more likely to drop out of high school. And, if you're a young Indigenous bloke today, you're more likely to go to jail than to university. That's despite decades of good intentions and billions and billions of dollars that have been invested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'no' campaign says you don't need a voice because all of the answers are here and politicians know best—you can hear some of those noisy 'no' voices right now—but that unyielding gap between black and white Australians tells us that's wrong. If we want things to change then we have to do more than just change what we do. We have to change the way we do things. That's what the Voice is about. It starts with recognition—recognising the fact that Australia didn't start when Captain Cook got here. It's about listening. This is an advisory committee. When you listen to people, you get better results and you get a better use of taxpayers' money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said a moment ago that, if you're a young Indigenous bloke, you're more likely to go to jail than uni. It costs taxpayers, on average, $11,000 every year to send an Australian to university. It costs taxpayers $148,000 a year to send someone to jail. That's $11,000 a year to set someone up for life and $148,000 a year to lock you up for life. And, if you're a young person in the juvenile justice system, it's more like $1 million a year. What if better policies, informed by listening to people who know what they're talking about, helped more young Indigenous people to finish school and go on to university, rather than to jail? That's what we mean when we say 'better results and a better use of taxpayers' money'. Isn't that what we all want? It's not easy—it's hard—but it's worth it. It's about building a country where no-one's held back and no-one's left behind, and that is what the Voice is all about.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  In recent days there have many who've claimed to have stopped robodebt. Last week, the member for Cook claimed he stopped robodebt. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I closed the scheme down during the operational phases of the scheme when the issues and unintended consequences first arose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he's not the first former coalition Liberal minister to now claim credit for stopping robodebt. Stuart Robert, the former member for Fadden, also famously claimed credit in this place. He curiously didn't credit the member for Cook for it! Whilst the commission doesn't deal with the member for Cook's claim that he stopped robodebt—presumably because no-one except the member for Cook thought that he would ever say that!—Commissioner Holmes did have something to say about Mr Robert's claims. She found the evidence provided to the commission by Mr Robert on this point to be less compelling. She continues that Mr Robert was informed of the existence of AGS advice warning of a potential illegality on 4 July 2019. And, for the record, Mr Robert decisively acted five months later!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, not to be outdone, there's another former Liberal robodebt minister who has also popped his head up to claim credit; it's the former member for Aston, Alan Tudge. Breaking the habit of 15 years of parliament, I read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spectator</span> last week—it was actually sent to me. Mr Tudge outs himself that he effectively stopped robodebt by removing all the bad parts of the scheme. He writes, 'I paused the raising of debts,' and he lists some other areas which he changed. He then essentially asserts that after his interventions there was nothing bad to see here. For the record, I remind Mr Tudge that after he civilised robodebt it went for three more years. There were 156 AAT decisions that the DHS were wrong because robodebt used averaging to calculate the debt, and there were many articles. In fact, between 2017 and June 2020, hundreds of thousands of people were still robodebted. Nonetheless, if Mr Tudge wants to claim credit for stopping it, well done!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But who really did end the illegal robodebt scheme? I'll draw attention now to the words of the royal commissioner. She congratulates Madeleine Masterton and Deanna Amato. These are individual citizens who took on the federal government. She says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The litigation in <span style="font-style:italic;">Masterton</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Amato</span>, in both cases conducted by Victoria Legal Aid, played a crucial role in the demise of the Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission concludes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It succeeded in exposing the illegality of Robodebt where other possible forms of check on the Scheme … did not …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to be perfectly clear and answer the question, those opposite did not stop robodebt until the legal system forced them. And now the Leader of the Opposition has to decide whether he will agree with the royal commission's findings or he will keep white-anting the royal commission, showing that those opposite have learnt nothing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government does not release Office of National Intelligence assessments that are provided to the National Security Committee. The government doesn't do that, and there are very good reasons why that has been the protocol over a long period of time, from both sides of the chamber, no matter who has been in government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made my government's position very clear, including in my speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, which is the region's—and perhaps the world's—most serious gathering of national security and defence experts, including defence ministers and heads of departments from dozens of countries. We had, of course, General Campbell, the CDF, as well as Greg Moriarty, head of the Department of Defence. I spoke there very clearly about my government's position, which, consistent with the position that the Biden administration has taken, is that climate change is a national security issue. We haven't hidden that. We say it. We talk about it. We engage with the Pacific Island Forum about why that is the case.</span>

                  </span>We engage in all of our international forums, whether it be through the UNFCCC, that have been attended by the minister, or whether it be through the recent meeting of AUSMIN, where I, along with our foreign minister and defence minister, met with the US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, and the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. When we met in Brisbane, one of the things that we spoke about was climate change as a national security issue. It's something that is a consistent theme, not surprisingly, from the world. Indeed, at the NATO summit that was held in Vilnius in Lithuania, the impact of climate change was a constant theme as well. It has an impact on food security. It's having an impact on migration. It's having an impact on so many areas of the globe, which is why we have to put it in that frame as well. But the government does not release—and we make no apologies for not releasing—national security advice, which, appropriately, goes to the National Security Committee. That is a position that we have had for a long period of time, and that will remain the position— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time </span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

What warnings about the conduct of the Youpla Group were ignored, and how would an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice help to avoid such neglect in the future?</span>

Can I start by acknowledging the great work you've done in your community. I know that you've done outreach with your community about this issue. More broadly, nationally, I know you've met with the coalition of peak organisations who are making representations to parliament on this issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Youpla was a disgrace. It was an absolute disgrace. You had a dodgy company flogging junk funeral insurance to First Nations communities. When it collapsed in 2021, 14,000 First Nations families were left stranded. They couldn't pay for their funerals. We came to government a few months later. There were bodies trapped in morgues, who could not be buried. The Minister for Indigenous Australians and I moved quickly to put in place an interim arrangement. We're standing in the shoes of the insurer, and I'm pleased to report that over $2 million has been paid out and around 250 claims have been made. Funerals are happening. The thing about this that's a disgrace is that the behaviour was well known to successive governments for close to 30 years. This mob had a rap sheet that Chopper Read would be proud of. For over 30 years, regulator after regulator, state departments and federal departments were made aware of what was going on. In 2015, Centrelink took them off Centrepay—an acknowledgement that this was a mob that was doing harm to community. But seemingly it took another two years before that decision was even implemented.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission handed its report to the former Treasurer in 2019. It took another two years for licensing arrangements to be put into place which led to the closure of the fund. The minister for Indigenous affairs, when we were shadows, wrote to the Treasurer in 2020 and said: 'As soon as this happens, the company will collapse and these families will be stranded.' Nothing happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact of the matter is that, for over 30 years, this business was taking advantage of First Nations people—taking advantage of their known cultural practices. Millions of dollars were lost in premiums. It was known by government and it was known by regulators. But nothing happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there'd been a Voice to Parliament, that Voice would have been listened to. And whether it was a coalition government or a Labor Government, we could not ignore the clear call to fix this mob up. It's time to do this differently. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australian manufacturers know that we've got their backs—that we've got a strong plan for Australia's existing and emerging manufacturers, to help them grow and thrive; to add value, create jobs and export to the world. But we have also stepped up to act when the situation demanded it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australian manufacturers were faced with a global energy crisis, with the cost of gas and coal soaring, the Albanese government stepped up and stepped in. The actions made a difference. On the Energy Price Relief Plan, the facts, the numbers, are compelling about what it did. Remember: in the second quarter of last year—the final quarter of the Liberal and National government—the electricity prices that confronted Australian manufacturers rose by 60 per cent. You fast forward to the second quarter of this year, where they were predicted to jump 33 per cent, and, in actual fact, based on the recent data, they fell by 1.5 per cent, showing that the Albanese government's Energy Price Relief Plan had helped shield manufacturers from the worst of those energy price spikes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now here's how industries that called for help to tackle this problem reacted. Capral's CEO—and I just visited Capral's Bundamba facility in the member for Blair's electorate just the other week—said the government's actions in the short and medium term are an excellent step forward. The Energy Users Association of Australia congratulated the government on a balanced approach, saying it looked after domestic energy users in the national interest. Manufacturing Australia's CEO highlighted that government's the world over are intervening to protect customers, and went on to say that the Australian government is right to do the same. That's the take of Australian manufacturers who knew we stepped up when they needed it most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what was the hot take of the catastrophiser-in-chief, the Leader of the Opposition? He went on to make a number of big claims. He said that the Energy Price Relief Plan was a disaster. He said it was a massive con job. This one was a doozy: he claimed it would lead to blackouts! Blackouts, he claimed! No claim too outrageous or absurd! I guess that if the Teflon count is big enough the embarrassment just whooshes straight off—that's what it does! The master of disaster! But what did you expect? This is the party of robodebt, who are only interested when people's lives are miserable. They're not there to help. They voted against the Energy Price Relief Plan and voted against the National Reconstruction Fund but are always there to back their own political interest above the country's interest.</span>

I know the assistant minister, if standing orders permitted, would be delighted to answer this question.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member knows, there was a competitive process undertaken to implement our commitment to deliver a number of endometriosis clinics across the country. She is right that the one clinic that succeeded in that competitive process in South Australia is located in Kadina. The assistant minister and I have both received representations, including particularly from the member for Boothby but others as well, about the restrictions that that places on people in Adelaide, but also in other parts of country South Australia, from getting access to this new, innovative model of care. The assistant minister is working very hard on ways in which we can have an additional process for additional clinics. She will have more to say about that in due course. But I'm sure the assistant minister would be very happy to have a direct discussion offline with the member for Mayo about the impact that these programs are having particularly on her constituency.</span>

I'm also delighted to report, after our visit to a general practice this morning, that she has excellent blood pressure, which is often very difficult in this line of work we are in. She also promised her constituents at the last election that we would deliver cheaper medicines, and that is exactly what we are doing. In just 12 months we have delivered three different waves of cheaper medicine reform, which is already saving Australian patients tens and tens of millions of dollars, and we're working hard as well to list new cutting-edge treatments on the PBS so Australian patients get access to the world's best medicines—they're coming on right now—at affordable prices. Last month, for example, we listed a medicine called Kerendia, a new treatment for diabetic kidney disease. Now 26,000 Australians will have access to this life-changing treatment at no more than $30 a script—$7 a script if they're concessional payments; $30 a script otherwise—instead of paying a thousand dollars per year to have access to this relief.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Canberra intimates, we want to do more. We are determined to make medicines even cheaper, which is why we accepted the advice of the medicines experts who manage the PBS to allow doctors to issue 60-day prescriptions for ongoing health conditions at the price of a 30-day script. It is a policy that just makes sense. It saves patients time and money, halving the price of common medicines for six million patients. It frees up millions of desperately needed GP consults for much more serious complex health conditions, and it improves medication compliance. We know that from evidence overseas. This is why so many other countries already do this, and that is why pretty much every patients' group and every doctors' group in the country supports our policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  I sincerely welcome that question, which goes to the Garma Festival. If it was somewhere where there were issues and problems, then the Leader of the Opposition would have been first there. But because it was a celebration of what's positive, a coming together of Indigenous Australians, he was nowhere near it. So accustomed is he to acting in bad faith that he assumes everyone else is too. Those opposite should have attended the Garma Festival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what is different between last year and this year. Last year the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and shadow Attorney-General, the member for Berowra, was at the Garma Festival and made a constructive contribution to it. I think that gave the people at the Garma Festival a great deal of hope that there was an opportunity to actually lift up this nation by responding positively to the generous ask that is represented by the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It is a generous ask that arose after many years of process and consultation—including by Tony Abbott, who established a process when he was Prime Minister—on the form of constitutional recognition it should take, not whether it should take but what form. Tony Abbott hoped 2017, with the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, would represent the year in which the coalition government would take a referendum forward and give Australians a chance to say yes. Instead, we have seen between last year's Garma Festival and this year's a walking away from the process in which Julian Leeser had been involved since at least 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition thought that saying 'sorry' would be the end of the world; now he thinks listening to people will be the end of democracy. That's what he thinks. The conspiracy theories are colliding with one another. He's struggling to get his scares straight.</span>

This week is Homelessness Week, and the theme of this week is 'It's time to end homelessness'. On census night more than 1,500 Australian veterans were homeless. Today, I convened the first of a number of consultation sessions that will contribute towards our new defence and veteran mental health and wellbeing strategy, something you would think those opposite would be very interested in. The strategy implements one of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission inquiry in 2019.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the roundtable, we heard the perspectives of medical professionals, those who practise in the space of mental health and wellbeing, assisting serving personnel and veterans. They highlighted that housing is a fundamental prerequisite in helping veterans who are suffering from mental ill-health. We can't move forward in assisting those who do not have secure housing. So it is fundamental to assisting the development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy that we also deal with homelessness. Indeed, we heard that the risk of suicide in the Australian population is double if someone does not have access to safe and secure housing. That is a matter that is fundamentally affecting our veteran community. So, we know, in trying to tackle the issues that the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide is grappling with, that housing is fundamental to that effort.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that our government is doing in bringing forward the Housing Australia Future Fund, which sets aside $30 million to assist veterans who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of experiencing homelessness, is fundamental to our veteran community, not only in assisting them with this important issue of homelessness but also in helping members of our veteran community who are suffering mental ill health to tackle that, to gain treatment, to gain access to the services they need. It's also fundamental to a very important issue that was raised in the round table today, and that's social connectedness. If you have insecure housing, if you don't have a secure location, it is very difficult to put down roots and to gain connection into a community. These are very important issues. Yet—</span>

Yet those opposite and their friends in the other place are failing to support the Housing Australia Future Fund to release $30 million to support our veterans who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness. So, in this Homelessness Week, it is time to end homelessness, and it's time for those opposite to get on with supporting the HAFF. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They were talking about housing. They were talking about education. They were talking about community safety. These are the issues that go to the persistent and stubborn gap that exists between non-indigenous and Indigenous Australians when it comes to social disadvantage. That is what the Voice is going to be focused on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I thank the member for Lalor for her question and for her ongoing passionate devotion to women's sport and lifting up women's and girls' participation in sport. I know that like many Australians she was up well past three this morning cheering the Diamonds on, and I thank her for her form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a game! And it was made even better by the fact that, from broadcasting to camera crew to commentators, it was all women this morning. Firstly, I want to give a huge congratulations to the Diamonds—to Coach Stacey Marinkovich, Captain Liz Watson and their team—for trouncing the old enemy, England. Bravo! A 61-45 defeat of the Roses, Kiera Austin with an MVP performance of 15 goals, a fairytale ending for Ashleigh Brazill—the Diamonds just secured Australia's 12th Netball World Cup championship in 16 attempts since 1963.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our female athletes are excelling on the world stage. Our female athletes are changing sport in this country forever. The women's football World Cup has ended any and all arguments about the popularity and importance of elite women's sport. Women's sport is not a phase, it is not a nice-to-have, it is not a charity; it is thrilling, it is brilliant and it is here to stay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's World Cup is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to foster inclusion, diversity and participation for women and girls. Just look at the Matildas' 20-year-old superstar Mary Fowler. Mary grew up in Cairns sleeping in caravan parks and learning to play football on Mission Beach. She's now getting literal goals in front of record global crowds. Sport has completely changed Mary's life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, because it is always more than sport, it is always beyond the result as well. The successes we are seeing are not cures. Women still face major barriers on many fronts—societal, cultural and procedural. Although there is strong women's participation in grassroots sport, girls are far less likely to progress to high-performance or professional roles than men are in this country. They are far less likely to become sporting officials, far less likely to become sporting chairs and far less likely to become sporting CEOs. In Tokyo, 51 per cent of our Australian athletes were women but less than 20 per cent of the coaches were women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But sport can be a driver for inclusion. In the lead-up to the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games we must and will use sport to help tackle issues of race and of gender. This government is determined to support people to achieve their dreams, from playground to podium and from unmown suburban lawns to walking out onto a World Cup pitch in front of 80,000 people. Just like Mary Fowler, just like Alanna Kennedy and—from my lips to God's ears—just like Sam Kerr at 8:30 pm tonight!</span>

                  </a>  Very quickly, on indulgence, I want to associate the coalition with the words of the minister. I don't think we can underestimate the impact, not just on young girls but on young boys as well. The role models like we're seeing in the Diamonds, and now in the Matildas, are right across every code and are quite phenomenal. It makes us incredibly proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people, actually, as I look across the chamber, who are probably suffering a little through sleep deprivation for a number of reasons. But to see Liz Watson and the team in action was quite remarkable. We're going to see the Matildas tonight and no doubt they will be inspired by what they saw from the Diamonds. I offer my hearty congratulations to a team that had phenomenal success: 61-45 is a big score, and that gap is quite remarkable. There has been the support of all of those behind the scenes: the partners and all of those who have been involved in making it possible for those young players to play the game that they love for a long period of time—in some cases from when they could barely walk. It's a remarkable journey and it's an inspiration in the run-up to 2032. We congratulate the Diamonds on their World Cup win.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 July I announced on behalf of the government that there would be a parliamentary inquiry into insurer responses to the 2022 floods affecting South-East Queensland, the Northern Rivers of New South Wales and the central western districts of New South Wales. It is the truth that there is barely a city or town in Australia that hasn't been hit by floods or by fires and other natural disasters in recent years. They are becoming more frequent and more intense, and the destruction more devastating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About $14 billion is how much the Insurance Council of Australia estimates the damages from storm and flood cost in the period from January 2020 to December 2022. That's $14 billion. Almost every state and territory experienced a major flood event in that period. When these natural disaster events hit, they leave trauma behind and social and emotional crises. They also cause an economic crisis for the communities affected. Each time, the recovery job is enormous and multifaceted. Food, shelter and supplies are the most immediate needs. Labourers and building supplies need to arrive quickly into communities. Insurers employ surge workforces to process huge volumes of claims. Experts in hydrology are brought in to determine where, in the case of a flood or a stormwater event, the water came from. With this knowledge, the terms of reference for this inquiry take a whole-of-economy and social view of the effects of these events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I announced the inquiry last month, I was with the member for Calare, who's in the chamber today, in the town of Eugowra in western New South Wales. We stopped at a place called The Fat Parcel, a popular local food van. I can assure you that this is not on the Heart Foundation of Australia's recommended eats in New South Wales, but it's a fantastic place to get all manner of burgers, fries and other sorts of goodies. I spoke with some of the tradies who were still erecting temporary block homes for people to live in eight months after the flood had hit and made so many people homeless. The member for Calare and I were welcomed into the homes of Lesley and Brian Smith. I won't forget both what they told us about their own experience and the warmth with which they greeted us. They had used their entire life's retirement savings to move to the town and enjoy a quiet life in the country. When I met Lesley and Brian, they were still living in a temporary block home, stamped onto their front lawn. Eight months after the flood, they were still in a dispute with their insurers. They were unable to move back into their home, which remained painted in my mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we visited Molong earlier that day, I was struck by the sense of community. I met local business owners, like Sarah, who ran the local hair salon, and Kaylene, who owned the local newsagency. Like most small business owners, they work around the clock and invest not only their money but their heart and soul into their businesses. Sarah employed an apprentice and her long-time best friend, who were both left instantly jobless when the flood came. Sarah shifted trades overnight and began working as a labourer, I believe, in a concreting business with her partner—very versatile; from hairdressing to concreting. Kaylene quickly poured her own money into the newsagency to fast-track repairs. The business became the post office, the bank and the convenience store for the town. Kaylene was still waiting for her insurance claim to be resolved when the shop floor remained covered in wooden slats, which were exposed after the owners ripped up the carpet themselves. They all shared stories about the immediate aftermath of the floods. The entire community held the weight of the clean-up on their shoulders. What they didn't expect was the fight ahead when it came to their insurance claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, when we talk about the effects of climate change, we no longer use the future tense; we talk about it in the current tense. One of my first visits on becoming minister was to the town of Lismore in New South Wales' Northern Rivers. I joined with the state member Janelle Saffin, the member for Lismore, who pointed out a sign on a telephone pole that showed the high-water mark from 1974 at 12 metres. At the peak of the 2022 floods, that sign was underwater because the waters rose to 14 metres. Cut through the politics and the denial, and you'll find a simple unavoidable truth: natural disasters are happening more often, and they're getting worse, and, of course, there's inequality at the centre of it. Most exposed communities are in places like western New South Wales, North Queensland, the Northern Territory, northern New South Wales and Western Sydney, where there is a huge threat of extreme weather. In these places, you'll find low-income earners who live in the areas that are more likely to be impacted by the effects of these severe weather events. Let's not mince words. it's low-income earners who will bear the brunt of climate-change-induced severe weather events. They're the same people who struggle to afford the mitigation work, by the way, and they're the same people who are struggling to afford insurance. They're overrepresented in the underinsured or the non-insured. And they're the people who most desperately need a smooth claims process when something goes wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure the member for Calare will use his own words to describe this in the chamber today, but I remember his very passionate words when we spoke about this in towns like Cudal. I was very pleased to visit my old youth stomping ground in the town of Cudal. When we visited Molong and Eugowra, the member spoke very passionately about his dissatisfaction with the claims-handling process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In places like these, instead of having a smooth claims-handling process, many found themselves in dispute over exactly where the water came from. Was it stormwater run-off or a flooding creek? Was the water running into the creek or out of the creek? That'll determine the impact on your insurance claim. Hydrology reports are expensive, and few people are trained to write them. These reports can cost an individual up to $10,000. That's money that's always hard to come by, but when you've lost everything it's impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even where claims are paid out, there can be serious delays in the repair work, and the communities often need to rebuild from the ground up. They can struggle to find enough labourers, and there are supply chain issues that mean delays in getting the building supplies needed, a point that the member for Gilmore has raised with me in relation to the bushfires that affected her community in southern New South Wales in 2019-20. The member for Eden-Monaro has raised the same issue, and, just to ensure that I'm not seen to be partisan, I will say that I've heard the member for Page make similar representations in this place about the impacts of floods on his community. Some losses can't ever be replaced, but when people are suffering, when things have fallen apart, they're entitled to expect that the recovery won't be made harder than it needs to be. They're entitled to a process that is as simple, efficient and compassionate as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're setting up the inquiry. We want it to look at all of these issues, and we'll give it plenty of time to inquire. I see Dr Mulino in the chamber today. He's an eminently qualified chair, and he'll work across the parliament in a very bipartisan way. I know that others will be invited to join the committee as they need. I expect several reports to be published by his committee to address the various aspects of what is a deeply felt issue. I know there's a lot of expectation, from the communities that I've mentioned, other members of this place and the community and the industry more broadly, about how we can focus on some pragmatic, practical solutions to the problems that people are feeling in their households, businesses and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee will hear from people on the ground in affected communities. They'll travel, ask the questions, listen carefully to the answers and try to find a way forward. I look forward to receiving the recommendations that can be made to the parliament, to the government and to industry about how we can make the claims process clearer, how we can deal with affordability issues and how we can ensure that people—and this is all about people—who are going through one of the most traumatic moments in their life can, at the very least, have an insurance process that works much more easily, with less sting and pain in that insurance process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I close, I'll just note that the government is not just about setting up inquiries. The Albanese government, upon coming into government, has had a range of initiatives. The Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt, is leading the rollout of the Disaster Ready Fund, which will invest over $1 billion over five years on risk mitigation work, reducing risk with the view that if you reduce risk you reduce the cost pressures on premiums. We've set up a hazard risk partnership to get data and the initiatives and to have better information about firming up our infrastructure. This is a collaborative approach between industry, government emergency management and financial ministries, such as mine, to ensure that we can do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for Calare for his passionate advocacy and for first raising the matter with the Prime Minister about a month ago. I want to thank the member for Moreton, Graham Perrett, and the state member for Lismore, Janelle Saffin. I've mentioned the member for Page, who has raised this matter here. So many members have raised this with me. I am incredibly indebted to their passionate representations in this place. I wish the chair and his committee godspeed, and I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  When residents across the Central West woke up on Sunday 13 November 2022 they had no way of knowing that it would be the last day before their lives were split in two: before and after the storm. That night and the following morning, locals across Molong, Cudal, Eugowra, Wellington and Canowindra faced water torrents so strong and terrifying that roads became rivers, homes sailed down streets and two much-loved residents were, tragically, lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who saw the absolute destruction of that day and the monumental clean-up that followed, it would be hard to find a scene more gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. But more heartache was to come. Hundreds of disaster-hit residents and business owners, eager to pick themselves up and fight on, found themselves at the mercy of insurance companies. In the nine months since, the rebuilding and recovery process has been made much harder, and the tragedy much worse, by the cold-hearted and shocking response of insurers to policyholders. In some cases it was almost like they were in competition for which one could care less. Our region and many other disaster-hit areas along the east coast have been left reeling from the callous conduct of insurance companies, from long delays in claims processing to widespread knockbacks. It's taken a massive toll across our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stories of tragedy are everywhere. During the public meetings I held around the electorate recently, we heard stories of homes being over-stripped out, denial after denial of claims, and insurance premiums skyrocketing for some people to up to 10 per cent of the value of their property per year. The stories of our disaster-hit residents who faced horrific torrents of water, only to be hung out to dry by their insurance companies, must be heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Change needs to come from this. That's why I called for a parliamentary inquiry into the insurers' response to these natural disasters. I would like to thank the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services for visiting the storm and flood affected towns of Eugowra and Molong recently and seeing firsthand the devastation that residents have been faced with. I would also like to thank the minister and his office for their productive engagement in drafting the terms of reference for this inquiry. I thank the Prime Minister for doing what he undertook to do in determining if a parliamentary inquiry would be possible. This inquiry must not be just a box ticking exercise. It must be a turning point, a pivotal moment in the way insurers deal with disaster-hit policyholders. Enough is enough. In response to my question last week on this very issue, the Assistant Treasurer confirmed—and he repeated it in the House today—that it was through listening to stories like those shared by Sarah Bone from 17 Shades Hair Studio in Molong, Kaylene Philpott from the Molong Post Office and Newsagency, and Brian and Lesley Smith from Eugowra that made him see that a broader scope for the inquiry into insurance was needed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Assistant Minister Jones said in his response, 'Australians take out insurance policies to protect themselves in times of need and tragedy.' These policies are meant to be a safety net for policyholders, not an added burden when disaster strikes. Insurance policies should not only be simple and easy to understand; they should not be adding to the anxiety created by a disaster through mismanagement of the claims process. The Assistant Treasurer said he took from his visit to our area that communities like Eugowra, Molong, Wellington and Canowindra have pulled together like country communities in Australia do. But they need more support and they need their insurance claims dealt with better and their policies honoured in a better way. That is why I engaged so heavily with the Assistant Treasurer to produce the terms of reference that I believe will enable not just residents from our area but people across Australia who have had their lives turned upside-down by natural disasters and the response by their insurers to tell their stories and ensure this level of heartbreak is not experienced again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that one of the terms of reference did raise an eyebrow, and that is that the report will take into account other reports, such as the Deloitte report into the insurers' response to the recent storm and flood events. I just say this about that particular issue: whilst I wasn't consulted on that particular term of reference, to me, that is the big end of town reviewing the big end of town. Deloitte was commissioned by the Insurance Council of Australia to review their performance, and they obviously want the committee to take that into account. Well, I have no doubt that this committee will give that report the weight that it will deserve. I think it will be the evidence that local residents and business owners around Australia will give directly to this inquiry that will really tell the story. I put my faith in this committee and not the review that the big end of town is undertaking for the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the inquiry to travel to the Central West to hear the stories of heartbreak and the cold-hearted response of insurers, just like the Assistant Treasurer did during his visit. The reality is that there is a huge power imbalance between policyholders and insurance companies. At the end of the day, if a policyholder wants to fight a knockback from an insurer, they're going to need to fork out big dollars for an expert hydrology report and also a solicitor. If you've lost everything or your business is in ruins, there is just no prospect of fighting back. That's the cold, hard truth. Despite what the industry says, at the end of the day that's what you need to do—you need the hydrologist and the solicitor to take these companies on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories of insurers trying to do the right thing are sadly few and far between. Australians expect insurers to be assessing claims in a generous and kind-hearted way, and nothing less. Insurance companies don't answer just to shareholders but also to the nation. They don't just have insurance contracts with our residents; they also operate with that social licence. We need to get to the bottom of what's happened here and make sure that the pain that insurance companies have inflicted on our communities is not repeated in others. I'm hoping that this inquiry can shine a real spotlight on the experience of our local residents and that they will get a chance to tell their stories on a national stage so that other communities won't have to go through what we have endured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also urge the state and federal governments to activate the full suite of disaster assistance measures that have been made available to other parts of the state but have, sadly, been denied to our residents. This is support that has not been delivered to date—assistance such as the home buybacks and retrofit schemes, the Community Assets Program to help rebuild towns and villages, funding for our damaged roads and bridges, and a program similar to the Northern Rivers Commercial Property Return to Business Support Grant. The people of the Central West deserve nothing less than the same level of support these other areas have had, and I will keep on fighting until they get it. The injustice of this support being activated for some of the state not our region is appalling. We are being treated as second-class citizens. It's wrong, and this wrong must be made right. I look forward to this inquiry being a catalyst for change for disaster-hit Australians right around our country.</span>

In addition and in closing, I would just clarify a comment I made earlier. I mentioned The Fat Parcel in Eugowra. Just in case it wasn't abundantly clear, what I saw when I met with Judd and Tracey in this little community square—it's a pop-up food van. It's not just a small business; it's actually a meeting place for the entire community. I think he was stranded on the roof of his truck during the floods. He was one of the first in to help people sort out their businesses and their problems afterwards. I saw a tremendous human being and I saw somebody who is providing a service as a gathering place. If that wasn't abundantly clear in my earlier comments, I welcome the opportunity to clarify now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 10 per cent of Australians still smoke tobacco daily. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death and disability in Australia, responsible for something in the order of 21,000 deaths in Australia each year. Research has shown us that changes in tobacco tax are effective in improving population health by incentivising smokers to quit. In fact, it's one of our most successful health policies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposals that I've tabled propose amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The government committed to these measures in our last budget, the 2023-24 budget, to encourage smokers to quit and to help the government achieve the priorities of the National Tobacco Strategy 2023-2030. The Minister for Health and Aged Care is very passionate about these, as is the entire government. The government is doing this through two means. First, the proposals increase the excise and customs duty on tobacco goods by five per cent per year for three years, starting from 1 September this year, in addition to the current biannual indexation. Second, the proposals increase the excise and customs duty on tobacco goods that are subject to the per-kilogram rate, such as loose-leaf tobacco, to broadly align them with the effective duty paid on tobacco goods subject to the per-stick rate. It is effectively an equalisation measure. This increase will be phased in annually over four years from 1 September this year.</span>

The Migrant Workers Taskforce was established in 2016 by the coalition to identify proposals for improvements in law and in law enforcement and investigation and other practical measures to identify and rectify cases of migrant worker exploitation. The taskforce was chaired by Professor Allan Fels and included members from a wide variety of government agencies. The report was presented to the government in February 2019 and was released publicly on 7 March 2019 along with the government's response.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report made 22 recommendations and the then coalition government accepted in principle all 22 recommendations. The coalition then developed legislation to implement recommendations 19 and 20 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce</span>. That was the Migration Amendment (Protecting Migrant Workers) Bill 2021, which was introduced on 24 November 2021. The 2021 bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on 25 November 2025. The committee report was tabled on 18 March 2022. The 2021 bill lapsed at dissolution prior to the 2022 election.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of the measures in the bill we are debating today are a cut and paste of the coalition government bill; therefore, in principle, we support this bill. Although, through a Senate inquiry, we do want to check that what the government has added hasn't added a huge regulatory burden and that they have it right, especially when it comes to the implementation, but, in principle, we support what the bill is trying to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's bill was examined by the Senate committee and the Labor members of that committee, led by Senator Kim Carr—now retired—made 10 pages of comments in the report of things that were wrong with the bill. Yet today's bill does not pick up on any of that. It is fortunate that it doesn't, because it was basically just pure political pointscoring. It's good that we are able to look at something that is all about the facts and make sure we deal with migrant exploitation while, at the same time, ensure that employers in this nation are not overburdened by red tape and regulatory burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current bill also includes additional areas in the repeal of section 235 of the Migration Act, which currently provides that a temporary visa holder who breaches any condition of their visa that restricts the work they may do or an unlawful non-citizen who undertakes any work at all commits an offence. The government is seeking to repeal this. The fact that this particular criminal offence hasn't been used in, it's my understanding, about 25 years does point to it maybe not being effective. So we're happy to look at this as part of the Senate inquiry process. Obviously, if the rationale is a good one, it's something we will support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've received a briefing on the bill from officials in Home Affairs and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. I thank the minister for arranging that, and I thank those officials. We had a good, open and frank discussion for about an hour on all the various parts of the bill. That proved to be incredibly useful in me being able to brief shadow cabinet and the party room on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, there are some concerns. If an employer makes a minor mistake when dealing with a migrant worker—for example, asking them to undertake a task that does not fall under their visa class—we want to make sure the employer wouldn't be sanctioned by burdensome rules and red tape. This is important, especially when it comes to small business. For instance, say you were employing a chef and your waiting staff didn't turn up. In the heat of the moment, you're under pressure, so you ask that chef whether he could help serve tables. That becomes an inadvertent breach. We want to make sure there is a proper-balanced and proper-scaled approach to a matter like that. That chef might have worked in the kitchen for two years, and it might have been the first time that something like that had happened. It happened because of the pressure the small-business owner was under, not them willingly or wanting to force someone to work outside their visa conditions. We just want to make sure that there is the appropriate flexibility and the appropriate scale as to what types of misdemeanours we might be talking about. As we demonstrated in putting this bill in place before there was a change of government, where there is serious exploitation, obviously we do want to deal with that. We need to ensure that, while we protect migrant workers' rights, we don't create a legal minefield for small businesses that make a minor mistake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have consulted widely on this bill with a broad range of groups. They all, in principle, support the bill, but they also want to ensure that the red tape burden isn't going to make it very difficult for small business, in particular. There are concerns that the bill may have an effect beyond its stated purpose of establishing protections in employer/employee circumstances and may disproportionately affect, for example, farmers and horticulturists using migrant workers to deal with workforce shortages. One of the things that has been suggested to us is that the government should consider introducing education or guidance programs to ensure that employers fully understand their obligations under this legislation if it passes the parliament, as I assume it will. One of the things we do have to make sure is that people understand what these new rules and regulations entail and that they understand that there are scaled penalties for a misdemeanour or an offence which is established under this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons we're happy to give in-principle support to this bill and just check the details with the Senate inquiry is that we on this side understand that we need to help and support the government when it comes to immigration because they're making a complete mess of it. We know there are 1.5 million people heading our way. We know that there's no plan for how they're going to be housed; what it's going to do to the rental crisis; what it's going to do to congestion; how it will impact on our health sector, which is already under enormous pressure; and what impact it will have on the environment. We've just seen today, in relation to the pandemic visa, that there were more pandemic visas issued after the borders were opened than there were when the borders were closed. This pandemic visa seems to be just another way that the Labor Party can add to their 'big Australia' agenda—by issuing the pandemic visa like it's going out of fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My hope is that the minister will find another way to deal with the skills shortage rather than using the pandemic visa. We are hearing, since all the publicity today, that this is just another measure in Labor's 'big Australia' approach, and that the minister will move now to end the pandemic visa. We will wait and see. We've got the data up until March, and we'll continue to look at that data to see how the pandemic visa is being used by Labor for their 'big Australia' approach. There's also the issue of the 102,000 people who have sought asylum here in Australia and have failed to get that asylum. When Labor were in opposition, they made a big song and dance about this and said that something needed to be done about it. As we understand it, in the Nixon report, there are some suggested solutions to how the Labor Party might be able to deal with this issue in government, and they're sitting on that report. They haven't released the Nixon report. Having made a big song and dance especially about those people who are coming by plane, seeking asylum once they're here and being unsuccessful in seeking asylum, we now find out that the government is sitting on the solution that has been given to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of problems with Labor's 'big Australia' approach. That's why, when it comes to small issues like this, we're happy to support the government. They've put legislation in place which builds on legislation that we developed. We just need to check the red-tape elements of it, but, in principle, we support it. I commend the bill, as long as we get proper Senate scrutiny of it and, potentially, have the ability to make changes to ensure it doesn't bring a huge red-tape burden to employers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  This is a very important piece of legislation before us today, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. At the outset, in making my remarks in support of the bill, I want to acknowledge the many workers over many years who have advocated for change so that migrant workers would not be exploited in a country like Australia. I acknowledge the Migrant Workers Centre, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the United Workers Union and so many other organisations who have spoken out over many years, particularly workers who, despite risk and fear in speaking out about their own exploitation, have courageously come forward about what has been an absolute injustice in this country, with coercion, wage theft and exploitation taking place. The reason that these workers so bravely spoke out was to bring about change—the kind of change our government is implementing through this bill—to make sure that no other migrant workers experience what they went through. This is about real justice, at last. It comes from over a decade of work by so many brave people determined to see change. I'm really proud to stand here as a member of a Labor government that is making this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my work before coming to this place, I heard many stories. I heard from people right across the country about their experiences. For a moment, let's imagine the farm worker in regional Victoria. They have been employed to pick vegetables, cash in hand, in a regional community. They are underpaid, sometimes earning as little as $5 an hour. They are forced to live in a dilapidated shack with eight others. The employer insists on deducting money from their pay, at a cost of $200 a week, for this shabby accommodation. One of the workers is sexually assaulted by a supervisor and is not taken seriously when they come forward and speak to the police about it. Having come forward, they are scared about what will happen. Will they be able to stay in Australia? Will their visas be signed off by their employer? This is a terrible story, but, unfortunately, it is one that too many people in our country have experienced. Imagine you're working in a poultry boning shed. You live in the western suburbs of Melbourne, and every day you're transported in a white van to your employer—again, paid cash in hand. You're bullied, harassed, injured at work and too afraid to speak out, lest you be punished for doing so. Australia is a better country than these stories suggest, and I'm really pleased that we're taking the exploitation of migrant workers so seriously through this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of reforms is designed to confront head-on some of the problems that I've described. One in six recent migrants to Australia are paid less than the minimum wage. This exploitation hurts us all. Of course it hurts the individual worker, but it also drives down wages and conditions for every worker. We see exploitation all around us, and, where others have failed, our government is committed to addressing it. This bill will implement key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels's <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce</span>, the recommendations of which were not taken seriously by the previous government. It is now up to us to implement the recommendations in full to protect workers as much as we can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are new criminal offences for using a person's migration status to exploit them in the workplace—this is recommendation 19 from the taskforce. There is a new tool to prohibit employers engaged in exploitative practices from hiring workers on temporary visas for a period of time—this is recommendation 20 from the taskforce. And the bill will go further. There will be high penalties for those who do the wrong thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABF will receive new compliance tools, which is really important because, while it is obviously very important that we have laws in place to prevent the exploitation of workers, we need to make sure that these are implemented properly through effective compliance. We are repealing the part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions—effectively criminalising speaking up. That is a key part of the change we're making today, which is to shift the onus, to shift who needs to be responsible for the terrible things that we are seeing in workplaces across our country, and to really be part of ensuring that justice is truly able to be pursued where it needs to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been taking the work of the Migrant Workers Taskforce and the work of a range of other organisations really seriously for many years. We know that recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experiences who work in the same job. We know that temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce, but in 2021-22 they made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act, so we can clearly see that the exploitation of migrant workers is a considerable problem in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new criminal employer sanctions that we're introducing in this bill will mean that coercing people to work in breach of their visa conditions will become a new criminal and civil offence, and the penalty for doing so will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. This is a really important deterrent to employers who might be considering exploiting workers due to visa conditions. We know that for many workers one of the barriers to coming forward and speaking out about things like underpayment and unsafe workplaces is that they're really worried that it will affect their visa conditions. So we should also expect to see more people having the courage to come forward and stand up for their rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be prohibiting employers and individuals who have done the wrong thing in the past from hiring future workers on temporary visas. The triggers for prohibition will include court orders and noncompliance with migration and employment law. Where employers and individuals are subject to prohibition notices, the minister will publish the relevant details on the department's website. This is a really important step, as there is currently no ability to prevent employers who have been sanctioned under the Migration Act from hiring international students or backpackers despite the vulnerabilities these workers face. We'll see some unscrupulous employers be unable to continue exploit very vulnerable people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to align and increase penalties for work-related breaches with the maximum penalties available under the Migration Act. This will see penalties increase from 60 units to 240 units, sending a really important deterrence message. We will also be able to make sure that enforceable undertakings for work-related breaches are possible, seeking to use similar provisions under the Migration Act for the Australian Border Force, providing them with additional tools in their enforcement approach. As I mentioned before, it's all well and good for us to have the laws in place, but we need to be able to ensure that they are being effectively enforced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of other amendments that we are making here, and there are a range of other things that our government is doing to ensure that we finally do what's required to implement the key recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. We have seen over the last decade an absolute crisis of exploitation in workplaces across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I mentioned a couple of examples at the beginning of my contribution here today, but there are others that people may be well familiar with, like the 7-Eleven scandal, which began a lot of the work that led to the Migrant Workers Taskforce. We've seen, through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> episode slaving away from 2015—quite some time ago—brave horticulture workers share their stories about what their experiences were, and yet we are now, in 2023, finally seeing the effective action being taken by our government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The taskforce reported to the Morrison government in 2019, and, unfortunately, not much had progressed from that point. Clearly, this was not a priority for the previous government. It was not taken seriously. Our government takes tackling exploitation really seriously. One of the big issues that we saw as well over the last 10 years was a preference from the previous government for temporary visas rather than permanent visas. What that effectively does for a lot of people is that it makes it easy for unscrupulous employers to target vulnerable workers because they know that they can use the temporary visa status to coerce people and make them feel vulnerable and insecure in this country. Those opposite also created a backlog of almost one million visa applications. So, clearly, they were not taking their responsibility in relation to migration very seriously, neglecting basic administrative tasks and looking the other way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is despite the fact that so many different organisations, advocacy groups and individuals gave advice that we have a severe problem with exploitation in this country and that action needs to be taken. Of course, that includes Professor Allan Fels, who was the chair of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. It includes the Migrant Justice Institute and Human Rights Law Centre. It also includes the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance, the peak industry body in horticulture. Those members represent half the industry turnover of Australian fresh produce. They've said that this bill supports the integrity of visa programs and contributes to whole-of-government initiatives to combat migrant worker exploitation. The Grattan Institute have supported this. Of course, as I mentioned at the beginning of this, the work of the Migrant Workers Centre and the Victorian Trades Hall Council, as well as the Australian Council of Trade Unions, spoke out early on about these issues, which must be noted and commended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of work to be done to make sure that everyone in our country in a workplace is treated with respect and is safe. Of course, the implementation of all the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ork</span> report that our government implemented is also really significant to provide that positive duty to employers to ensure that workplaces are free from sexual harassment and discrimination. That is something that, of course, does affect migrant workers too, and I have seen firsthand the terrible impacts of that in workplaces where there are a lot of migrant workers employed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, our government is taking the issue of improving the migration and visa system really seriously. We're taking issues of workplace safety really seriously, and we're making sure that we're correctly looking at who needs to be punished for instances where there have been breaches of visas, where people have been coerced to do so because of the vulnerability to being exploited by unscrupulous employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that, at last—after decades of work from lots of people right around the country and, of course, after many brave workers have spoken out about their experiences to finally get justice and change in this world—our government is taking the steps that need to be taken to make sure that everyone is safe at work and is not punished for speaking out by having their visa status threatened in this country. We're so much better than that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  Migration is central to the story of Australia. As the daughter of a migrant, I know firsthand the contribution that migrants make to our wonderful and diverse society and the opportunities that Australia can provide for those who come to our shores to work, study and live. When migrants come to Australia, they expect to be treated fairly, particularly in the workplace. But the truth is that by some estimates up to one in six migrants who've recently arrived in Australia have experienced exploitation at their place of work—for example, through wage theft, having their passports withheld, threats of visa cancellation, bullying, and harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem of migrant worker exploitation was highlighted by the 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce, by the recent independent review of the migration system, by submissions to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and by people who have contacted my office. A few months ago I was contacted by a temporary migrant on a sponsored training visa. She'd been working for an accounting firm but after six months had still not received the wages that were owed to her. When she raised the matter with the company, a senior executive threatened to cancel her visa and demanded money from her. She soon discovered that other trainees had had a similar terrible experience. This kind of exploitation is devastating for those affected. But it doesn't just harm the migrants themselves. It also harms the vast majority of Australian businesses who are doing the right thing, and it harms Australia's reputation as a destination for people across the world who are looking for a great place to work, study and live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long we've failed to get our migration system right. In 2019 the Migrant Workers Taskforce presented 22 recommendations for tackling temporary migrant worker exploitation. This bill implements several of them and so is a step in the right direction. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 targets unscrupulous employers with harsher penalties and bans on employing migrants as well as the expansion of the Australian Border Force 's enforcement powers. Importantly, it also provides better protections for workers to pursue claims via the Assurance Protocol, and I'm glad to see the government also committing to creating a workplace justice visa for those affected by exploitation. If implemented well, these measures would be good for migrants and good for the vast majority of businesses who are doing the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill will be effective only if it is accompanied by stronger action on enforcement, measures to prevent the conditions for exploitation to occur and, importantly, proper support for businesses to implement these changes. Firstly, enforcement: there is no use having good laws if nobody is there to enforce them. That's why I ask the government, as recommended by the Grattan Institute, to ensure that the home affairs department and the Australian Border Force have the right resources, culture, policies and prioritisation to enforce these changes and transparently measure and report on their effectiveness. The Fair Work Ombudsman must also play a role in ensuring that all workers in Australia are protected, regardless of their work visa status. But their record in identifying and acting on illegal employment practices is poor, and they need to be properly resourced to do their job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it's about preventing the conditions for exploitation to occur. As the independent review of the migration system recently identified, visa conditions are one of the three main factors that create conditions for worker exploitation. I know the government is considering measures to reduce this vulnerability, including the form of a workplace justice visa, and I look forward to seeing this work as it progresses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, support for business: the vast majority of businesses in Australia want to do the right thing by the migrant workers, and they do so. But many find navigating the complex array of government rules and regulations difficult. This is certainly what businesses in Wentworth have told me. I therefore ask the government to work with businesses to minimise the burden associated with the additional regulation and to ensure that employers have easy access to the right information and support to ensure compliance. As part of this, I ask the government to consider a transition period for these reforms to give businesses the opportunity to revise their processes, bring in new procedures and train their staff without the immediate threat of penalties for noncompliance. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has raised this point with the minister, and I ask him to consider it seriously. I also ask the minister to, as part of broader reforms to the migration system, consult closely with business about how the broader visa system works and to work out how we can make it easier for businesses who are trying to support and include migrant workers in their workplaces to do that in a way that is simple, is cost-effective and allows them to bring the best workers to Australia to contribute to their businesses as well as to the broader Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a system that works for business and is simple, efficient and effective to employ is absolutely critical if we are going to raise productivity and get the best people into the country. Australia should be the best place to work in the world for a migrant, but right now too many migrant workers are subject to exploitation. While most businesses want to do the right thing, a few bad apples are holding us back. This bill is a step in the right direction but must be accompanied by additional measures if it is to have the desired effect.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I rise to commend this bill, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023, and I do so because action in this space is important. It's also overdue, and it is overdue because, following a decade of neglect from the former Liberal government, it's now up to the Albanese government to take much-needed action to implement the key recommendations in the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. This report came about after our nation saw a crisis of exploitation occurring in a number of workplaces, and despite national debate and the uproar caused, the former Liberal government chose to take no initiative. We know, because it was brought to our attention and it was brought to the nation's attention, what was happening to many migrant workers. There was rampant exploitation going on, which led to the Migrant Workers Taskforce, who made recommendations that the former government failed to bring on after two years. That report went to the Morrison government in 2019. Two years on, a bill was introduced but, as per the common poor standards of the former government, the bill was never brought forward for debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, there was lots of talk. There was an inquiry. There was a report. There was even legislation drafted. But the actual final steps to make those laws were not taken by the former government, and when you hear and remember those words, that low wages were a deliberate feature of the former government's economic plan, you can make your own assumptions about how those low wages were created. But we know worker exploitation was part of driving down wages because it undermined other businesses who were behaving appropriately. Businesses who were paying award wages to migrant workers, businesses who were doing the right thing, were actively being undermined, creating a false economy, by people who were doing the wrong thing. The lack of action from the former government is not surprising, but it took a devastating toll on our country's valued residents. Electorates like mine felt the brunt of this, and small businesses in electorates like mine felt the pressure to comply with what was irregular rather than what was regular, because those exploiting workers got a competitive edge and got a better bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Introducing this bill fulfilling the report's recommendations is a priority for this government. When I say vulnerable workers were exploited, they were targeted by some companies giving preference to temporary visas as opposed to permanent visas. A backlog of almost a million visa applications was created. Basic administrative tasks that are crucial to a seamless operation were neglected. It's time appropriate action is taken to protect those who contribute their skills for this nation's benefit. We've done a lot of work in our first year of office around migration and the visa system. During our time in government we've already made significant changes to the migration and visa system. Tackling exploitation is only possible through the establishment of a functional and well-administered visa system. Extended waiting times for visas and poor service to clients create additional vulnerabilities and problems for workers in our nation. With regard to visas, we have significantly slashed the backlog created by the former government by employing over 500 new staff. There are now fewer than 600,000 visa applications at hand. Now that we're in government, temporary skills shortage visas for health and education workers are being assessed and finalised in a matter of just a few days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we took government the backlog for citizenship has been reduced to fewer than 80,000 people, which is the lowest it has been in six years. Up to 90 per cent of people are now waiting less than six months for a citizenship ceremony. In my electorate, that has been critical. My local government has worked tirelessly across these first 12 months to get a backlog of citizenship applications actually through citizenship ceremonies, because we know how important citizenship is to people. For many in our communities who come into the country on refugee or humanitarian visas it will be the first time they have citizenship. I hear it all of the time at citizenship ceremonies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other people may have come on a student visa and then gone on to employment and, working through the system, getting their permanent residency. In my electorate the waiting time to go from permanent residency to citizenship had blown out, so I am pleased to be a part of the government whose intent to shorten these time frames has seen action occur in my local government, where they now understand how important it is for people who are seeking citizenship to do so as quickly and conveniently as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made significant efforts towards establishing safe and fair working conditions. Despite this, one in six people who have recently migrated to Australia are being paid less than the minimum wage, and consequently this drives down wages and worsens conditions for other workers in Australia. This government is committed to addressing any and all kinds of exploitation, and we are taking action now. This bill will take key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels's Migrant Workers Taskforce report and implement them to create a much more appropriate standard for those employing migrant workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As per recommendation 19 from the taskforce, new criminal offences will come into effect for those who use someone's migration status to exploit them in the workplace. A new tool will also be engaged in prohibiting employers that have engaged in exploitative work practices from being able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period, as per recommendation 20 from the taskforce. There will be an aligning and an increasing of penalties for work related breaches, with an increase from 60 units to 240 units. This will act as an important deterrent. Compliance notices for work related breaches, which consist of a formal notice for employers who are in breach of relevant Migration Act and migration regulations, will be enforced. This will allow for the promotion of compliance with the Fair Work Act. There will be consideration of worker exploitation as a potential mitigating factor should a visa cancellation be under consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to doing more than just the bare minimum. This bill will go further. Higher penalties will be implemented for transgressors. The Australian Border Force will receive new compliance tools. A part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions, which criminalises speaking up, will be repealed by this government. Through the implementation of appropriate protections from visa cancellations, workers will be encouraged to speak up and report exploitation. I have heard stories in my electorate about threats of visa cancellations and how they are used to exploit workers and get them to work for below minimum wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not be surprised that those opposite failed to act, because since we have come to government those opposite have refused to back in changes that this government is making to ensure workers are getting paid award wages. They oppose a regulation that would make it illegal to advertise a position for below the minimum wage. They oppose it. It makes good sense to everybody else in the country. It makes good sense to people in my community that you shouldn't be able to advertise a position when you're not prepared to pay the remuneration that the position is entitled to. That seems fair to me. They are the same kinds of practices against which this bill will put in place deterrents and fines, so as to ensure that workers are not exploited and to ensure that the legislation carries public awareness around what's going on here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Border Force will receive new compliance tools. The part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal offence for workers to breach their visa conditions, which criminalises speaking up, will be repealed. We encourage workers to speak up and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections from visa cancellations. In turn, this will protect businesses doing the right thing. It will protect all of our workers from having their conditions and their remuneration undermined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government provided $50 million over four years to the Australian Border Force in the 2023-24 budget. The ABF oversaw a month of action in July and used its resources to target employers who were suspected of doing the wrong thing. The government is raising awareness of employer obligations and taking action to get out and visit businesses in a substantive way for the first time in a very long time. This work would not have come to fruition had there not been an increase in funding or the prioritisation taken by this government to tackle worker exploitation. As Minister O'Neil made clear, this indifference will stop with our government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be a positive change for those who have chosen to call Australia their home and who are being exploited. This is a matter demanding a response. The former government's lack of competence and value on this matter will not continue to be reflected in the current government's actions. Our government has been engaging in an intensive co-design process with industry, unions and civil society to assist in informing the design of further safeguards within the visa system. We want it to be safe for those who are being exploited in their workplace to speak up and to do so in the confidence that our government is backing them. We want to explore the potential for a new visa for workplace justice to ensure this exploitation ends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are aware that there are gaps in what workers understand. There may also be gaps in what employers understand. Many people are unsure of who to turn to or where to go should something go wrong. Our migration system needs to work for everyone. It needs to work for the workers and it needs to work for business. Part of that is creating public awareness of these changes, but also ensuring that we have in place policies and a government that will take action where people ignore the rules, where people seek to avoid the rules and where people seek to undermine wages and conditions in this country and undermine other businesses while doing so. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  As indicated by the lead coalition speaker, the member for Wannon, we are supporting the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 through this chamber. We will take the opportunity through Senate debate to look at some of the regulatory impacts of this legislation that only a committee consideration can uncover. Assuming that nothing significant changes there, no doubt we will support the bill through the Senate. Frankly, this bill emanates from the work of our government, the previous government, which established the Migrant Workers Taskforce. We introduced into the last parliament a piece of legislation that responded to those recommendations, but the calling of the election meant that that legislation lapsed. Most of that legislation is in the bill we are debating now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of businesses in my electorate that employ workers through the migration system. and they are all exemplary employers. My experiences with them are that some employ people locally, while others have their headquarters in my electorate but they might be a rural or regional business where their operations are outside my electorate. I have the opportunity, as a local member, to meet and interact with those businesses. Of course, at times they will also come to me as their local federal member to raise with me and seek assistance for matters to do with the migration system and a visa that an employee might have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The businesses that I interact with in my electorate are absolutely all doing the right thing. I want to start by thanking them for the fact that they're employing people. In fact, they're businesses that in some ways are so successful that they need to seek additional labour through the migration system. The economy has been so strong in the last few years, and the employment market has been so tight, that the migration system has been a very important avenue for them to access new employees so they can continue to grow their business. That means, of course, paying more tax to people like us, in the federal government, to fund the society that we live in. We're very lucky to have these employers, and I don't think the tenor of this debate should be some kind of assumption that every employer is seeking to exploit someone in their workforce, particularly those that are coming through the migration system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fully acknowledge that there are a small proportion of employers that are doing the wrong thing, and this is legislation that appropriately strengthens and tightens the framework so that employers who are doing the wrong thing are properly held to account. We want everyone in the workforce, whether they're an Australian citizen or working under a visa, to be working in an environment and under a framework that we legislate. Wherever there are examples of opportunities to make that system more robust, we should take them, and that opportunity exists in this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The businesses that I work with and interact with in my electorate that are employing people are absolutely doing the right thing. In fact, they are bending over backwards to help the staff that they take on, particularly through the employer sponsored visa system, to not only earn an income but also benefit from the innovative programs these businesses have that support new migrants. The businesses do what they can to provide additional support well beyond the remuneration that the employees are provided by virtue of working in that business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One challenge in my home state of South Australia that I have spoken about repetitively in this chamber since I was first elected is that, in essence, we have a national migration scheme that is very much one size fits all. There's not a lot of flexibility in it. We're setting policy that is trying to balance burgeoning major metropolises, like Sydney, Melbourne or even South-East Queensland, and regional and remote areas in my home state of South Australia and other states, which have quite different population problems and challenges. In the cities, the population has been growing far too rapidly and putting an enormous burden on the creaking infrastructure of those cities, and infrastructure investment has not kept pace with population growth. But we've got some communities in our country that have been depopulating for many decades and, indeed, have excess capacity in parts of their infrastructure because the population has been reducing. That's the case particularly in agricultural communities, where efficiencies in agriculture have meant the unit labour required per hectare of farmed land has dramatically changed over the decades. That's a good thing for productivity, but it has also demonstrated not only a challenge but an opportunity that our migration system hasn't properly taken advantage of. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other jurisdictions—for example, Canada—where they have a much more differentiated approach to migration, which is very much geographic. The issue in this country is that even the schemes we've established, like the regional skilled migration scheme, have not been strictly required. People can apply to get a visa that purports to ultimately have them come and work and live in South Australia, and the South Australian state government might sponsor them through that regional skilled program, but, invariably, more often than not, that human capital ends up in the big cities like Sydney and Melbourne, so the principle of the scheme hasn't been strict enough and robust enough to ensure that the outcomes or the principles of the policy are being achieved in practical terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has indicated that it's undertaking this broad review of the migration system. Well, that's great. Although, having reviews of the migration system is a very common drumbeat across both sides of politics. It is really up to the government as to whether or not they want to look deeply and seriously at this population workforce imbalance and challenge that we have. It's not just geographic; it's obviously in categories of work as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very disappointing that the Labor Party were so opposed to our agriculture visa. We know that the union movement was very, very engaged in ensuring that that was the position of the now government. That was really disappointing because that was a huge opportunity for regional Australia in particular to have a dedicated visa channel for them to address the significant Labor shortages in regional areas and in particular industries in original areas. Unfortunately, the union movement went from embassy to embassy in the lead up to the election, telling those nations that were seeking to engage in bilateral agreements under that visa program not to dare consider signing up to that. That was a great loss to our economy and to regional businesses out there succeeding so much and trying to employ more people, grow their businesses and pay more taxes. That allows us to do a whole lot more for our society, as the federal and state governments benefit from it, too.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, regrettably, we have a situation where the union movement has been undermining those efforts, and that's a great shame. The union movement makes these claims, but I have certainly never met a business that has a preference to employ people through a sponsored migration scheme in lieu of an Australian. That's just nonsensical. There's obviously a much higher cost and a higher risk to a business to seek to employ someone by sponsoring their visa and meeting all that risk and cost if they could employ an Australian. The reality is that they're attempting to but simply cannot find the workers in this country to take up those employment opportunities that those businesses have. If they don't avail themselves of the migration system, then the businesses will either not grow or, in some cases, shrink or shut down, because they cannot operate if they don't have a reliable, stable workforce. Then there are businesses growing their workforces or wanting to grow their workforces, and the migration system is obviously there to help them do that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a very proud migrant nation. Almost everyone in this chamber has a story or a connection to migration in some way, shape or form. Although, they would have addressed that before getting here under section 44 of the Constitution. Nonetheless, we all know that our migrant communities are thriving across this nation. As members of parliament, we love to engage in our multicultural communities. Migration has been a vitally important part of the Australian story, but, better still, it is going to be forevermore. We will always be a nation that has a level of migration. We are now, and we'll always be a great multicultural society into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But having an efficient migration system that is also making sure that the economic needs of our future workforce planning are met is going to be vitally important as well. We know, through all the projections, that if we don't have a migration system that is structured towards addressing those identified future pressures, let alone current pressures, we simply won't have the workforce that we need for the economy and the society that we want to have into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this bill through this chamber and obviously have no concern whatsoever in making sure that a stronger framework is in place to make sure that migrant workers are protected and given the protections that they rightly deserve: to be employed in conditions that follow the law of the land and that are the same conditions that anyone in this country should be employed under. We recognise that there is a uniqueness around the risk of exploitation of migrant workers, and so we welcome that as well.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by reconfirming my comments at the beginning of this contribution, which are that that should not send a message that the vast majority of employers are doing anything short of the right thing by their workforce. Every business that I've ever been involved in, and the businesses that I engage with in my electorate, see their workforce as their most important asset. Particularly in recent years, with such a tight employment market, businesses have been, more than ever before, doing so much in addition to the minimum to make sure that their workforce are well remunerated, satisfied and will have longevity in that business. When they're employing people through the migration scheme, that has certainly also been my experience in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome legislation that will crack down on bad actors and bad participants in this space but also commend the vast majority of businesses that are doing the right thing. I commend them for employing migrants, who add such richness to both our economy and our society. I look forward to supporting their future needs through a reformed migration system that is going to more appropriately fit those challenges that our economy is going to have into the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  There are a few facts in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill that I think are really important. The vast majority of employers are doing the right thing, unless of course you are a temporary migrant worker. Recently arrived migrant workers are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills or experiences. That's what a recent Grattan report said. One in six recently arrived migrant workers are paid less than the legal minimum wage. Temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce but in 2021-22 made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaches of the Fair Work Act. That's what our own Fair Work Ombudsman Commission said—and they're just the ones who came forward. That's just the work that the government is doing. Let's not forget about the case of blueberry workers being paid about $3 an hour to pick blueberries because of piece rates that were ripping them off. Union after union, worker after worker, taskforce after taskforce has told this parliament and previous governments that not enough was being done to protect migrant workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just for a moment touch base on what has happened in the past decade, if not longer. First, those opposite, in government, said there wasn't a problem, that it was a few cases. Then, as more media reports came out, they accused the workers and the unions of causing trouble. It was only after their own taskforce started to expose the true underbelly and extent of the problem that they finally acknowledged that there was a problem. But, rather than meet it with action, what we saw from those opposite when they were in government was just more taskforces and more committees to tell us what everybody else had been telling them for so long, that we had a problem: recently arrived migrants, regardless of what visa they were brought here on, were being exploited. It happens in the Seasonal Worker Program, where it explicitly says in that program that these workers must be paid the award rates. We are seeing workers being paid less. It's not just in agriculture that we have these problems. It's happening in hospitality, in the hotel industry, in retail work and in accountancy. It's happening in a whole bunch of industries, and that is why reform is so necessary. It took the election of a Labor government for real reform and progress to be made on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is progressing a package of reforms to tackle the exploitation of all workers, including migrant workers, and the bills that are before us right now seek to implement the key recommendation from Professor Allan Fels's Migrant Workers Taskforce report. I feel like I've stood in this parliament and spoken about this report time and time again, so I am so proud and relieved to be able to stand here and say that we finally have a bill before us that addresses and implements key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels's Migrant Workers Taskforce report. There are new criminal offences for using a person's migration status to exploit them in the workplace. This is recommendation No. 19 from the taskforce's report. There is a new tool to prohibit employers engaging exploitative practices to be able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period of time. This is recommendation No. 20 from the taskforce's report. This bill in fact goes further than the report's recommendations. There are higher penalties for those who do the wrong thing. The ABF will be receiving new compliance tools. We will repeal the part of the Migration Act that imposes a criminal penalty on workers who breach their visa conditions—effectively, criminalising them for speaking up. Can you believe it is actually a part of the Migration Act, currently, to criminalise people for speaking up about breaching their conditions when, in many cases, these workers were being forced to breach their own visa conditions?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one part of the Albanese Labor government's plan to protect workers. In the 2023-24 budget, the government provided $50 million to Australian Border Force over four years to help address and tackle the challenges that we're seeing. For the first time in a long time, the government is raising awareness about employer obligations and actually getting out and visiting the businesses in a substantive way to talk to them about their obligations. There are some employers who engaged labour hire who say they didn't know. Now they will know, and now they will have a responsibility. It became part of the business model that was supersized under the previous government: you use a labour hire company to outsource your obligations to these workers. We heard shocking stories—and, unfortunately, we continue to hear them today—about workers who get paid but then have deducted from their pay exorbitant fees for transport, accommodation and uniforms. In some cases, people had money deducted for things that they hadn't actually received. All of these methods were being used by unscrupulous employers, quite often labour hire companies, to exploit temporary migrant workers. We should thank temporary migrant workers. We are privileged to have them come to this country. We all know about the labour shortages in the industries that I have raised and others. We should be grateful and thankful that these workers choose to come to Australia to work, when they could work in so many other places, because we simply don't have the local workers to actually do the job. Yet, rather than thanking them, supporting them and paying them what they're worth, companies have exploited them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the industries that has had lots of issues is the meatworks industry. We have seen labour hire companies recruit workers—international students and people who are here as backpackers—and pay them less than other workers. There is other legislation that this parliament may consider in the future which will look at the 'same job, same pay' legislation and which will look at saying that labour hire workers should be paid the same or equal rates as other workers. Whilst that addresses another loophole, what this legislation does is look at the loophole and the challenges where migrant workers are paid much less—another example of why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Workers Union, which represents quite a number of farm workers, recently surveyed about a thousand workers in the lead-up to a submission that they had to the National Agricultural Workforce Strategy. Their findings reflect what we've been continually hearing for the past decade. They found that 32 per cent of workers surveyed experience dangerous and unsafe workloads. Twenty-seven per cent reported that they did not have access to toilets or efficient drinking water. They found that 32 per cent of workers were threatened by a contractor for making a complaint about wages and conditions. Sixty-three per cent of workers said that they were being underpaid. Forty-four per cent reported that they were being paid in cash. The fact that we still have workers being paid in cash demonstrates just how big the problem is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another survey that was undertaken by the union in 2019 found that the average hourly rate for horticultural workers that were surveyed was $14.80 before tax. That's well below the casual minimum wage and well below the full-time minimum wage. This is what is going on and this is why we need action to address it. Piece rates, subcontracting, the ridiculous rates that they're being charged for accommodation and the extra costs that are imposed on them for transport are all ways in which these migrant workers are being exploited, on our watch here in parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I'm so proud to be part of a government that is doing something about it, that isn't just setting up another taskforce blaming somebody else. Quite often what was happening under the previous government with these cases was the blaming of the very people being exploited for speaking up. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the bravery of those migrant workers, many of whom are here on temporary arrangements, for speaking up, as well as their unions—the AWU, the former NWU, now the UWU, and the SDA—for the way in which they've spoken up. It's a big thing for a worker to speak up about being exploited in the workplace. It's an even bigger thing for a migrant worker, who risks losing their visa, to speak up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the specifics in this bill are that a new criminal employer sanction will be introduced. Prohibiting employers and individuals from hiring future workers on temporary visas will be introduced. Aligning and increasing penalties for work-related breaches are part of this bill. Part 4 is enforcing an undertaking for work-related breaches. There are compliance notices for work-related breaches and a number of other amendments that will ensure that people working here on temporary visas are given a fair go and treated with respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing that it's taken a Labor government for this to be enacted. Treating people with respect in the workplace should be core business for all of us. Making sure that all workers, regardless of visa status, are paid the minimum wage should be the responsibility of all of us, not just because of the election of a Labor government. It is disappointing that it has taken so long—over a decade—for there to be real action. At the same time, I'm really proud to be part of a government that is acting on behalf of temporary migrant workers who've come here to earn a decent living and to help us with some of our challenges that we have with our workforce—that it is our government that is doing the work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge the Migrant Workers Centre in Melbourne that's part of the Trades Hall that has long advocated for change to the awful situation that migrant workers are in, because their visa status is quite often held over them. I would also like to mention the work that the Migrant Resource Centre have done in this place, and all the other civil society and community organisations that have supported migrant workers when they find themselves in situations of horrible exploitation. This is a horrible stain that we have on Australian workplace history, and it is good to see action finally happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As previous speakers on this side have mentioned, not only will we tackle the exploitation of migrant workers and ensure they get paid the same as other workers; we'll also help other workers to ensure their wages and conditions are not undercut. If you have the exploitation of migrant workers as part of your business model and you are able to pay them so much less than other workers who are either Australian citizens or permanent residents, then it puts pressure on everybody. It means their labour, because it is cheaper, becomes the labour of choice, and that's what we need to avoid. I encourage all of those in this place to consider this bill and to vote for it. It is long overdue, it is action that's required, it implements key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels' Migrant Workers Taskforce report and it is great to see it finally happening.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023, and I do support this bill in principle. The bill seeks to amend the Migration Act 1958 to strengthen employer compliance measures in relation to protecting temporary migrant workers from exploitation. The latest figures available reveal that on average there around 1.6 million temporary visa holders with a full or partial right to work in Australia each year. Obviously many of us speak in this place regularly about the importance of immigrants and migrants into Australia not just for economic reasons but also because they have built our society and will continue to do so. Our economy, our businesses and our country rely heavily upon temporary migrant workers to fill shortages within our existing labour market and increase the overall productivity of Australia. Our industrial relations system should be flexible, it should be diverse and it should definitely protect all workers, including temporary migrant workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although this is not the driving purpose of the temporary work regime, many temporary migrant workers decide to pursue full Australian citizenship through legitimate means available to them through immigration policies. When I attend ceremonies at my local councils, Liverpool city and Sutherland shire, it is always a pleasure to meet and welcome many of our newest Australians from all around our globe, many of whom started their Australian journey as temporary migrant workers. The work performed by temporary migrants is important. It is valued by employers and Australians overall. Temporary migrant workers have predominantly worked in the areas of agriculture, food production and meat processing, but they've also been required, when our economy has needed it and individual employers have needed it, in a full range of various goods and services across our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Employers value employees as a rule. However, no system is perfect, and temporary migrant workers can be at risk of exploitation. This bill seeks to implement recommendations of the former coalition government's 2019 report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce, and I think it's important to remember the taskforce was established in 2016 under a coalition government to identify proposals for improvements in the law, law enforcement and investigation and other practical measures to identify and rectify cases of migrant worker exploitation. The taskforce was chaired by Professor Allan Fels and included members from a wide variety of government agencies. The report made 22 recommendations in total, and the coalition while still in government accepted in principle all 22 recommendations. The stated purpose of this bill is to implement particularly recommendations 19 and 20 of the taskforce's report. This bill includes some measures contained in the Migration Amendment (Protecting Migrant Workers) Bill 2021. So this was work which was commenced under the former coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular the bill introduces criminal offences for employers who coerce temporary migrant workers into working in breach of their visa conditions and establishes a mechanism to prevent such employers from employing additional migrant workers for a period of time. These protections are appropriate. I do support these protections. I support this bill. However, this does not in any way mean that I am saying that the vast majority of employers, or indeed a very large minority of employers, exploit their temporary workers. The bill also provides measures to deter employers from exploiting temporary migrant workers, including mechanisms to encourage voluntary compliance and increase penalties for breaches of relevant workplace laws. There are also amendments introduced to remove some of the disincentives for temporary migrant workers to report exploitation where currently they may fear that their visa status would be in jeopardy if they did so. These all are appropriate measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Temporary migrant workers form a very important part of our national economy and workforce. Overall, they are valued and supported by their employers. It is appropriate that these workers are afforded the full legal protections to guard against some opportunities that may exist for exploitation. Migrants, including temporary migrants, have helped to build our country and will continue to do so into the future. Our industrial relations system should be flexible and diverse and include protections for all of our employees, including temporary migrant workers. Temporary migrant workers and having a viable and diverse workplace allow businesses to adjust their individual workforces when needed to meet the inevitable ebbs and flows in demand for goods and services across the country. We live in a global society. We operate in a global commercial world. Most of our employers are honourable and really do look after all their workers, but it is appropriate that safeguards are put in place, particularly for temporary migrant workers. And for those reasons, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  Too often in the media we see stories of migrants being exploited in workplaces right around Australia. There are tales of unscrupulous employers misusing a visa condition to coerce a migrant worker into not complaining about either their working conditions or, even worse, underpayment or other things. Moreton has significant Filipino, Taiwanese, Pasifika and Korean communities. Many of these young people end up working in the agricultural sector or the hospitality sector while they're in Australia. Most have fun and make some money. Some are exploited. A few years ago, I travelled with diplomatic representatives from these countries up to Bundaberg and then west to Lockyer Valley, and we interviewed some of these fun-loving farm workers from these countries to see how they were being treated. Sadly, both then and now, there are numerous cases of workers not being paid what they're legally entitled to be paid. Often, it is a subcontractor and middle people who are doing the exploitation. Unfortunately, the ne'er-do-wells often speak the same language as the person they're exploiting. We even hear of migrant workers being silenced after being sexually assaulted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All sensible members on both sides of the chamber would agree that such behaviour must stop, and I note the contributions from those on the other side prior to my addressing this bill. This is where the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 before the chamber will make a difference. The Albanese Labor government is taking action through addressing the recommendations made in the report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce led by Professor Allan Fels, which was handed down in 2019. No-one would be surprised that, even though the coalition government accepted in principle the recommendations of the taskforce—you guessed it—there was no follow-through. There was no implementation of any of the recommendations. It is another example of how the LNP is all about the announcement but hopeless when it comes to follow-through, unable or unwilling to put in the hard work needed to deliver something.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is clear evidence of the systemic nature of exploitation in Australia's labour market. Unscrupulous employers and facilitators have misused visa rules to exploit workers. According to a recent report by the Grattan Institute, up to one in six recent migrants are paid below the minimum wage. Another report, from Unions NSW, found that more than one in five workers are paid a lower salary because of their visa status or nationality. So it's not just a bad apple or two. Remember: if 20 per cent of the market is undercutting good employers, they set the tone for a race to the bottom. Those good farmers intent on doing the right thing are punished by those down the road doing the wrong thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is particularly concerned about the vulnerability of people who hold temporary visas. We have heard of wage theft, sham contracting, threats of a phone call to Australian Border Force, empty promises of permanent residency, and stories of people having their passports locked away or being sexually harassed and sexually assaulted. Obviously, this behaviour needs to stop. These actions don't just harm migrant workers; they also damage our international reputation. These workers go back, normally, and become 'ambassadors of bad'. They tell everyone of their exploitation and damage our international standing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those industries that require a migrant workforce—especially seasonal picking, where you've got to get to work when things are on the vine and ready to go—it means that those jobs won't get filled; migrants simply won't come to Australia, because of the horrors that they've heard from those 'ambassadors of bad'. Again, this has effects on not only those migrant workers but the broader Australian economy. As the saying goes, one drop of lemon juice can spoil gallons of milk. Therefore, these bad actors need to be stopped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is amending the Migration Act 1958 to (1) establish new criminal offences and associated civil penalties to deter employers from using a visa condition or status to coerce, unduly influence or unduly pressure someone in the workplace, (2) establish a new mechanism to prohibit an employer from hiring any additional people on temporary visas for a period of time, (3) increase the maximum criminal and civil penalties for all current and proposed work related offences and provisions in the Migration Act, (4) create additional tools for the Australian Border Force to address employer compliance, (5) repeal section 235 of the Migration Act, which makes it a criminal offence to breach a work related visa condition, and (6) revise the regulation-making power in the Migration Act to ensure worker exploitation must be taken into consideration for all visa cancellation decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the amendments in this bill, the government is delivering on its response to two key recommendations made in the report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. Recommendation 19 reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended that the Government consider developing legislation so that a person who knowingly unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a good warning. Recommendation 20 reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended that the Government explore mechanisms to exclude employers who have been convicted by a court of underpaying temporary migrant workers from employing new temporary visa holders for a specific period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing these criminal penalties will help deter those employers seeking to exploit vulnerable workers. There needs to be serious criminal consequences for this poor behaviour. A simple financial penalty on its own isn't a big enough deterrent. The perpetrators will balance a fine against the benefits that come from the suppression of wages and conditions in their workplaces through exploitation, so there needs to be criminal repercussions and also bans. The crooks shouldn't be able to access the workforce they've been found guilty of exploiting. This will help change behaviour and make the rogues think twice before going down that road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also remove section 235, which is the tool used to threaten migrant workers to exploit and coerce them under the Migration Act. This section makes it a criminal offence to break a work related visa condition, which deters workers from speaking up about their exploitative work environment for fear of criminal sanctions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of those opposite will bleat about how this is a weakening of the Migration Act. I haven't heard any yet; hopefully I'll be disappointed. Obviously I'm talking about a party who are happy to jump in front of a camera or to post on social media about how they're horrified by the treatment of migrant workers, but when it came to actually doing anything to stop it they sat on their hands and effectively did nothing. Why should we be surprised, when this is the party who had suppression of wages at the core of their economic policies? Do you remember their spokesperson detailing that? At the core of their economic policies was the suppression of wages. So why would they want to stop unscrupulous employers from helping them achieve their stated economic goal? They talked the talk but didn't walk the walk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The media have reported lots of transgressions, but, sadly, no convictions have been recorded against this part of the Migration Act, or for any serious breaches of a migrant visa. Visa cancellation powers still remain. So the bill carefully extends the new prohibition power to include breaches of the Fair Work Act and the Migration Act. This will ensure that workplace relations law and migration law are working together to protect workers and penalise those employers who do not abide by the law. This includes breaches of compliance notices and enforceable undertakings. Triggers will include remuneration-related noncompliance, but they also extend to other forms of exploitation, recognising the corrosive behaviour of some unscrupulous employers. And it will be a criminal offence where prohibited employers have been found to have employed an additional worker on a temporary visa whilst prohibited. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that the new provisions of prohibiting employers from employing migrant workers are enforced and that actions taken in breaking the law will also lead to a criminal offence. The decision to prohibit will be a decision for the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs or the Minister for Home Affairs, or obviously it can be delegated to a relevant decision-maker. I understand that Minister Giles is consulting and collaborating on how the Fair Work Ombudsman can play a constructive role in this process. This will include considering extenuating circumstances outlined by an employer, such as the impact the prohibition would have on the ongoing viability of the business and how that might impact on existing workers and the broader community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant measure. In industries where exploitation is particularly widespread, such as accommodation, food services, cleaning and construction, this is a necessary step to show that we can tackle exploitation where it is most prevalent. This bill will see additional powers given to Australian Border Force and an increase in penalties under the Migration Act. Maximum penalties for work-related breaches will be almost triple, with civil penalties of up to $99,000 for individuals and $495,000 for bodies corporate. In addition, Australian Border Force will gain a new compliance notice and enforceable undertaking powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures are designed to drive employer compliance under the Migration Act, which, sadly, has been deprioritised over the past decade. To assist the Australian Border Force in doing that, they will receive $50 million over the next four years to improve employer compliance as well as other immigration compliance priorities. We're also looking at measures outside of this bill to tackle the exploitation of people on temporary visas. The Albanese government is engaging with civil society, unions, industry and others on complementing measures to help people speak up about any exploitation that occurs in their workforce. This includes exploring what a whistleblower visa could look like and how the government can implement a firewall between the employment regulator and the Department of Home Affairs. We don't want to see our reputation as a leader in workplace rights and conditions continue to be tarnished by unscrupulous employers or their middle operators—the people who deliberately take advantage of migrant workers. As I pointed out, often they speak the same language as the person they're exploiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is making sure that we stop these poor behaviours. We want these people to face serious criminal consequences, and some of the tools they use to coerce and exploit will be removed. I commend this legislation to the House. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. If ever there was an example of an issue which demonstrates the importance of the role of the trade union movement, it is this one. I want to pay tribute to a number of trade unions who have been at the forefront of advocacy for this type of legislation and bringing to the public's attention the shocking and egregious exploitation of migrant workers. The SDA, the TWU, the AWU, the AMWU and other unions have been at the forefront of the campaign for better working conditions for migrant workers, urging the previous government to take action in relation to the egregious exploitation of those workers. When I was the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, I visited places of work and held forums in places like my home town of Ipswich, where metal workers were being exploited. I spoke with hospitality workers in Melbourne and farm workers in Bendigo. I want to pay tribute to the member for Bendigo, who has been at the forefront of the campaign on this issue for such a long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is long overdue. Those opposite have had 1,100 days in office yet have done nothing meaningful for migrant workers. Between 7 March 2019 and 10 April 2022, 1,100 days passed, during which the Morrison government did nothing meaningful for migrant workers. Why are those dates important? On 7 March 2019, not only was the Migrant Workers Taskforce report released but also the government's response was released. The Morrison government responded glibly, without giving the report the respect it deserved, and then failed to implement its recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 April 2022 happens to be the day the then Prime Minister, the member for Cook, paraded off down to the Governor-General—not to give himself yet another ministry, I might add—to call the federal election. So 1,100 days passed with nothing meaningful done. To demonstrate the abject dithering and delay of the former government, do you know who tabled the government's response to the Migrant Workers Taskforce report? It was the former member for Higgins, Kelly O'Dwyer. That was a couple of members for Higgins ago. Not only did a whole parliamentary term go by while the Morrison government did nothing meaningful, but two members for Higgins came and went. The irony is that the current Labor member for Higgins came into this place by way of a skilled migration program. As such, I know she recognises the struggles of migrant workers to make their way in Australia. Having arrived in Australia in 1984 with her parents from the UK via Zambia, the current member for Higgins's father qualified for skilled migration to this country as an accountant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been dithering and delay, and that is why this legislation is absolutely important. The member for Moreton aptly gave figures from the Grattan Institute and from other reports, including from Unions NSW, of the shocking exploitation of migrant workers, and this shames this country. It shames Australia internationally when people who come to this country get exploited. There is sexual exploitation, wage theft—workplace conditions that none of us would find acceptable. It shames our country, and it was ignored by the previous government. There was so much in migration that we needed to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to Professor Allan Fels AO and Dr David Cousins AM. They were the co-chairs of the Migrant Workers Taskforce and they put it best:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Wage exploitation of temporary migrants offends our national values of fairness. It harms not only the employees involved, but also the businesses which do the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It means that businesses who do the right thing by their workers get punished and they themselves get exploited. Workers get exploited in their workplace and the businesses who do the right thing get exploited. It puts at risk the workers who work for good bosses and puts good employers at risk as well. Don't forget that the temporary skilled migration income threshold, the TSMIT, which was the basis on which someone had to come to this country and not be paid less than nearly $54,000, had not changed from 2013 onwards. The previous government didn't change it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We got in—we increased it to $75,000 per year. The reason for that was the previous government had a deliberate design feature—an aspect of their core belief was to drive down wages. So, unintentionally, unwittingly, I think, they were helping the exploitation, weirdly enough. I don't believe they genuinely meant it; I really don't. But by their policies they were inadvertently aiding and abetting what was happening in exploitation, and that is not good enough. I don't believe those opposite have those views generally—I do not believe it. But their failure to take action meant that the exploitation continued, whether it was in Bendigo or Melbourne or Ipswich, and that is what happened. It is simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were many stakeholders who came to that report for the Migrant Workers Taskforce—the ACTU, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, recruitment and consulting services, the National Roundtable on Human Trafficking and Slavery, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Industry Group. There is a 140 page report—I've read it. It's a comprehensive report. The previous government did three pages of response, barely acknowledging, tokenistic and patronising in many respects. There was more than two years of painstaking evidence gathering on the exploitation of vulnerable workers. I think Professor Fels and Dr Cousins would have great grounds to feel dismayed and disappointed. It's very clear there was systemic exploitation in our labour market, and it was hiding in plain sight. There were many companies—and I won't name them all—that Australians deal with each and every day who have attracted adverse media attention for their employment arrangements. Those are companies that people might go and get a coffee or a donut at, they might be getting their petrol from them, and they are exploiting workers. These are well-known brands throughout Australia. It's simply not good enough. We need to do everything we can to prevent the exploitation of workers through the entire value chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, another case came up before the Federal Court on behalf of four migrant workers in the SDA—the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association—alleging that a franchisee had failed to pay for the all time they worked, failed to pay overtime and correct penalty rates, operated a cashback system, misclassified workers, denied pay entitlement, and breached payslip and recordkeeping requirements. This resulted in workers not being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. Effectively, in the end, when they did all the calculations, it totalled $1 million in underpayments. They sought penalties against the franchisee and the franchiser for breaching the Fair Work Act. That stuff is all too common.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Retail Supply Chain Alliance, comprising the SDA, the TWU and the AWU, making recommendations to the Senate inquiry, and there will be many inquiries in this place—in this House and elsewhere. It's not just the Fels and Cousins inquiry—the Senate inquiry recommended important changes as well. The Retail Supply Chain Alliance, consisting of the SDA, TWU and AWU, made a very good submission to the Senate inquiry about the unlawful underpayment of employees' remuneration to ward off ongoing exploitation. There were many recommendations about making sure there was a visa system works, and we are taking action here. One of the most important things we did was to slash the visa backlog processing times, improving it with 500 extra workers, having a national labour hire regulatory scheme, better licensing arrangements and more funding. These are some of the things we had taken up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill in particular is very important because it makes it a criminal offence to coerce someone into breaching their visa conditions—a key recommendation from Fels and Cousins. Why was it so difficult for the previous government to do that? There was no excuse. It's not like they had a huge legislative agenda that we were dealing with every single time we came to this place. We had 1,100 days and two members for Higgins, and they still couldn't bring themselves to bring it in. They brought it into the chamber but did not debate or pass it—Labor would have supported it, there's no doubt about that whatsoever—but they wouldn't do it. We need to make sure that we do it, and that's why this legislation is picking up those recommendations. The forms of exploitation the taskforce found were many, and I commend people who might be listening to look at it: unfair dismissal, unpaid training, working conditions that are unsafe, upfront payment deposit, pressure of working beyond the restrictions of a visa. There were many things that were egregious and appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this legislation it will be an offence to use a workers' visa status or a future work related visa requirement to coerce or unduly pressure a person into accepting an exploitative work arrangement. This was an election commitment we made to help remove barriers that stopped exploited temporary migrant workers from speaking out and seeking support. We're keeping our word, to deliver outcomes for migrant workers, and through them to improve wages and conditions for all workers. That's why we increased the TSMIT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes further important measures such as: where an employer has been convicted for underpaying migrant workers, that employer will be unable to employ migrant workers for a specified period of time, closing a loophole in our migration system. This prohibition is necessary to protect workers from employers who engage in serious, deliberate or repeated noncompliance with their obligations. We're publishing information about this. That's important for transparency so that workers actually know who the good bosses and bad bosses are. Everyone working in this country is entitled to protection from exploitation, including those on temporary visas. We're committed to making sure that wages and conditions improve for everyone, by stopping exploitation by unscrupulous employers. We're committed to the principles of natural justice, or procedural fairness, and decision-making based on factual evidence—a long-established approach to responsible government which seems to have eluded those opposite when it came to this issue for most of the last decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides that an employer can be declared prohibited—that is, the decision-maker must give the employer a written notice, and that notice must state the decision-maker proposes to make a declaration and provide the reasons for doing so. The notice must invite the employer to make a written submission setting out reasons why the decision should be made—procedural fairness; natural justice. The employer will have the opportunity to set out extenuating circumstances, which must be considered in decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For penalties to act as a deterrent, they must be set at a level that actually deters people from offending. The bill does just that, by increasing the penalties for unscrupulous employers misusing migration programs. This reflects the significant damage that employers who've done the wrong thing can do to public confidence in our migration system and to our national prestige and honour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key element of this bill is to repeal the offence currently set out in section 235 of the Migration Act 1958. That section makes it a criminal offence for a visa holder to work in breach of a work related visa condition or for an unlawful noncitizen to work at all. This offence has undermined the ability of workers on temporary visas to have recourse to their rights under certain workplace laws, such as workers compensation laws, and we've removed that barrier to justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Migrant workers should have the confidence to speak out and seek help without fear of visa cancellation, and the measures in this bill support those aims. Specifically, the commitment between the Department of Home Affairs and of the Fair Work Ombudsman known as the insurance protocol will be reformed. The protocol encompasses that a worker who holds a temporary visa will not have their visa cancelled for breaching a work-related visa condition if certain criteria are met. Stakeholders have told the government that the protocol is too secretive to instil the necessary trust and confidence. They don't trust it, because it's not transparent and it's not legislated. The bill will allow the government to make regulations to legislate the protections that are currently only available under government policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will work alongside industry and community groups, unions, civil societies, lawyers, researchers and other experts to examine protections available to workers on temporary visas and encourage them to speak out when they face exploitation at work. This government recognises the important role of the Australian Border Force in compliance and enforcement. For those employers who choose to do the wrong thing, beware: the ABF, and the law, will catch up with you. In the recent budget, this government increased funding for immigration compliance. Those who misbehave, do the wrong thing or exploit workers will be penalised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government will continue to work together with the community and industry groups across the country towards eliminating the exploitation of migrant workers. In turn, this will improve wages and conditions for all workers. That's something that any Labor government can be proud of. It's something that every government in this country should always be proud of. Even a coalition government should learn their lessons from the last nine years. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299964" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  I rise to speak on a matter of great importance, a piece of legislation that will shape the future of our nation, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. As elected representatives of our communities, we have the responsibility to uphold the values that define Australia: a fair go for all, compassion for those in need and a commitment to social justice. This is exactly what this bill is about. It addresses some key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels's 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce report as well as further measures to tackle migrant worker exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear from the outset that this bill is not about raising barriers or slamming shut the doors for opportunities for those seeking a better life in our country. It is about ensuring that our immigration system operates with dignity, fairness and transparency—values that we hold dear as Australians. Migration has long been an essential thread in the tapestry of our nation's history. It is the story of diverse cultures, of dreams realised, of aspirations achieved. Our society has been enriched immeasurably by the contribution of migrants who have chosen to call Australia home. They have brought with them knowledge, skills and traditions that have helped shape our country into what it is today: a vibrant, multicultural and dynamic nation. I know this because my family has been just one of many migrant families to call this land our home and to contribute to this community through work, volunteering and being law-abiding citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know that one in six recent migrant workers is paid less than the minimum wage. The negative flow-on effects from this affect all of us. It ultimately drives down wages and conditions for all workers as businesses seek to compete under these conditions. In one of my very first jobs, I experienced attempted wage theft through unpaid super contributions I discovered. Whilst I was lucky enough to migrate to Australia as a child, I do not doubt that this employer sought to take advantage of my youth and background to try and pull the wool over my eyes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill for its commitment to strengthening employer compliance in our immigration system. The establishment of new criminal offences and relevant civil penalties is designed to deter employers from using a worker's visa status as a negotiating tactic to lower their wages and conditions. This bill will increase the maximum penalty under the Migration Act for work related breaches, with civil penalties of up to $99,000 for individuals and $495,000 for a body corporate. Further to this, the Australian Border Force will gain new compliance and enforceable undertaking powers; $50 million will be invested in the ABF over the next four years to assist their actions to improve employer compliance alongside several other immigration compliance priorities. In fact, the ABF just oversaw a month of action in July expertly targeting those employers who were suspected of doing the wrong thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time in a long time, the shift in emphasis on ensuring employers are aware of their obligation is deliberate. It is Albanese Labor government policy. None of this vital work would have been possible without the increase in funding and the emphasis we are placing on tackling worker exploitation. Whether it is migrant or Australian worker exploitation, we strongly believe it should be eradicated across the board. It has no place in our great country. Going forward, the Albanese government is engaging in extensive discussion with civil society, industry and unions around methods to help inform and design further safeguards in the visa system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must make it as safe as possible for migrant workers to speak up when they or their colleagues have been exploited in the workplace. This government knows the anxiety and stress many migrant workers go through when faced with either working in terrible conditions or alerting authorities and subsequently risking losing their visa. That's why we've taken the steps in this bill to remove section 235 of the Migration Act, which currently makes it a criminal offence to breach a work related visa condition. Currently, this section of the act deters workers from speaking up about poor pay and conditions, because they then fear the larger problem of criminal sanctions. Perversely, some employers count on this deterrent so that they can exploit migrant workers. The removal of this section simply means that migrant workers who are being exploited through no fault of their own will be empowered to alert authorities to this so that it can be rectified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: this does not weaken the act in any way. There have been no convictions recorded against this part of the Migration Act, and the government's extensive visa cancellation powers remain in place, as they should. The very fact that there have been no convictions recorded against this section of the act shows that its only current purpose is to deter migrant workers from raising their voices. Its removal will not weaken our migration framework, only make it more efficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The heart of this legislation lies in protecting the rights of migrant workers who journey to our shores seeking a fair go and a chance to build a better future. Let us not forget that these are individuals with families, hopes and dreams, just like any other Australian, yet regrettably we have witnessed instances of exploitation, wage theft and unfair working conditions faced by some migrant workers. This cannot be tolerated in a society that prides itself on compassion and the idea of a fair go for all. This bill sends a powerful message: Australia stands firmly against any form of exploitation and is committed to protecting the vulnerable. This legislation proposes empowering our immigration authorities to be proactive in holding employers accountable for their actions. Stricter penalties will act as a strong deterrent against those who would seek to take advantage of vulnerable workers while providing incentives for employers to embrace fair and ethical practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critics may argue that these measures could discourage employers from hiring migrant workers, but this would only be the case if those employers were seeking to manipulate the conditions of migrant workers. For employers already doing the right thing, this bill will do nothing but help level the playing field so all employers do the right thing, unless they want to risk real penalties. Australian employers have always risen to the challenges presented to them, and they will continue to do so while recognising that their success lies in treating their workforce with respect and dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, let us not forget the importance of putting Australian workers first. The government's commitment to our citizens does not negate the recognition of the contribution of migrant workers to our society. By prioritising Australian workers for job opportunities we ensure that our people have access to meaningful employment and are not displaced in their homeland. Some may seek to misread our intentions, but the truth is we believe in maintaining a balanced approach to migration, one that safeguards the interests of both Australian workers and those who come to our shores seeking a better life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has always been a land of opportunity, and we must ensure that these opportunities are accessible to all, regardless of their background. To achieve this we must streamline the visa application process and facilitate cooperation between the Department of Home Affairs and the Fair Work Ombudsman. A collaborative approach between these agencies will ensure that the path to compliance is clear, straightforward and accessible to both workers and employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also address the question of exploitation that occurs within sectors that rely heavily on temporary migrant labour in agriculture, hospitality and other industries. Migrant workers often find themselves vulnerable to dishonest employers. This bill seeks to provide additional protections for those workers and ensures that their contributions are recognised, valued and rewarded fairly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is essential to remember that this legislation is not just about words on paper. It is about values we hold dear—the values that have shaped our great nation, like fairness, compassion and respect. This bill is a tangible manifestation of these values—a testament to our commitment to building a better, fairer and more prosperous Australia for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon all members of this place to support this bill, to embrace the ideals that define us as a nation, to stand united against exploitation and unfairness and to show the world that Australia remains a beacon of hope and opportunity. Let us move forward, building a path that reflects the very essence of our identity as Australians—a diverse, compassionate and fair society that celebrates the richness that migration brings to our shores.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in favour of the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. I would like to acknowledge the fantastic contribution to this debate from my good friend just now, the member for Holt. Our parliament is so much richer for having you here. This is an important additional step that the Albanese Labor government is taking toward ensuring that all workers that work in Australia can be free from being exploited by unscrupulous employers—and they do exist out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting the vulnerable and protecting workers is deeply embedded in the DNA of members of the Australian Labor Party. This is true of those within the parliamentary Labor Party and of the broader membership. The most eye-opening statistic amongst many worthy contenders is that up to one in six migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. This does not exist in isolation. Migrant workers being paid less than the minimum wage affects all workers. For, when employers think they've found a way to pay any kind of worker less than what is set at the base level and when left unchecked, it brings down the minimum standards for all of us, in not just wages but conditions too—unless mechanisms exist in law to deter and punish this kind of behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents who have the same level of skills and experience and who are doing the same job. Temporary visa holders comprise four per cent of our total workforce in Australia, but, within the 2021-22 year, migrant workers made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the eve of the Australian Labor Party's National Conference in a few short weeks, I look back to our national platform that was endorsed back in 2021, where the section that is quite germane to this bill reads as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Temporary overseas workers are vulnerable to exploitation and this exploitation affects those workers and all Australian workers by undermining their wages and conditions. Labor will ensure that migrant workers including temporary visa workers have access to adequate information on their workplace rights and how to join their union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another pertinent section reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Too often, temporary migrants end up exploited or underpaid with some employers abusing the system for cheap and disposable labour. Labor will always ensure that measures are implemented to protect all migrants from exploitation, including:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">requiring temporary migrants to be paid in accordance with Australian awards or enterprise agreements and to have their wages paid into an Australian bank account;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ensuring temporary migrants are protected by Australian workplace law and are not exploited through sham contracting or unethical labour hire practices give them; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">offering them 'whistle-blower' status if they are providing evidence of exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be my first national conference as a member of this place and a member of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. There is a feeling of pride in making a contribution on legislation like this or any of the multitude of measures this government has introduced in this 47th Parliament that moves the dial closer to parity between employees and employers. In this instance, the pride I feel boils down to being part of supporting legislation in this place that accomplishes the parts of our platform that I mentioned earlier. And why might that be? Because, as I said earlier, it is in Labor's DNA to stand up for workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this point, if one were to use private members' business as a litmus test for this theory and to seek the sheer extent of contrast from those opposite, I saw two motions last week. One was moved by the member for Holt on this exact issue, combating the exploitation of migrant workers in Australia. For the most part, it was an extremely gracious debate where we broke bread and agreed that a problem existed. Many anecdotes of exploitative practices that were aired were utterly reprehensible and observing of sanction, and we look forward to real action to combat this. Then we had the member for Sturt laying blame at the feet of the union movement. He couldn't imagine a world where any small-business owner might be tempted to engage a temporary migrant employee contrary to our industrial laws. The member for Sturt even went so far as to say the union movement's ultimate goal is to constrict migration. How does that stack up when key members of the opposition's brain trust, namely the Leader of the Opposition himself and the member for Hinkler, have criticised the government for letting migration levels rise to a slightly lower level than what they, when in government, modelled would occur prior to closing the borders at the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their criticism can only mean they are advocating for the pandemic-era border closures—but, of course, Labor and unions are against migrant workers. Frankly, from now on, I am hoping those opposite do an appropriate amount of warm-up stretches before engaging in debate on immigration or industrial relations, because the flexibility they must possess to somehow occupy both sides of this argument and blame Labor is quite impressive. If I were a high school debating adjudicator, I would be awarding some pretty high marks for that effort, but it's just a game to some of them. On our side of the chamber, it is anything but. As those opposite point out until blue in the face, we are full of ex-union officials, me being one of them. We have seen what exploitative workplace practices can look like in the real world and their effects on workers, not only on their hip pocket but also their self-esteem and mental health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't matter where you were born or what conditions someone has to work in in Australia; if you are working here, you deserve the full complement of workplace rights as everyone else. Allowing the derogation of workers' rights, conditions, entitlements, and minimum standards of our domestic workforce will hurt our migrant workforce, and the opposite is just as true, too. But it is our migrant workforce that faces additional vulnerability and susceptibility to falling prey to unscrupulous practices. This bill particularly aims to tackle the exploitation of migrant workers, which is something that has been exposed for its prevalence through a number of reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report of particular significance that has led to this bill is the one that the Migrant Workers Taskforce handed down. Additionally, a slightly more contemporary report I encourage members to read when they can is the report published by the Grattan Institute earlier this year called <span style="font-style:italic;">Short-changed: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ow to stop the exploitation of migrant workers in Australia</span>. The Migrant Workers Taskforce was commissioned to report to government largely due to the shocking revelations that were reported on in the media concerning 7-Eleven franchises—a company where migrant workers, namely international students, dominated its main workforce. Further investigations confirmed many of the reports by the media that workers were systematically underpaid, with franchisees going so far as to falsify records to hide these underpayments. It was quite evident that, mainly due to the prevalence of this transpiring amongst 7-Eleven franchises, the exploitation of migrant workers was baked into their business model in some of the most egregious ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migrant Workers Taskforce report was handed down to the government in early 2019. To their credit, the government at the time gave a response to the report mere weeks afterwards. This was something the Morrison government was known to have form for. However, the time line after that response was handed down is more on brand for the former government. The recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce, in addition to the bill introduced by the previous government that lapsed in the 46th parliament, culminated in this government introducing its own bill—the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. Without delving into every tiny detail contained within the bill, I will attempt to paint the measures contained within by way of broad strokes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1 of this bill introduces new employer sanctions against the Migration Act. This part implements recommendation 19 of the Migrant Workers Taskforce report, which proposes that the government develops legislation so that a person who knowingly and unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence. These circumstances will include circumstances where a person knowingly or recklessly coerces or exerts undue influence on a lawful noncitizen to work in breach of their work-related visa conditions, on an unlawful noncitizen to work to avoid an adverse effect on their continued presence in Australia, and on a lawful noncitizen to work to avoid an adverse effect on their immigration status or to avoid being unable to acquire the required information or documents regarding their work for visa purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The maximum penalty associated with each of the offences listed above shall be two years imprisonment or 360 penalty units. The civil penalty associated with these offences is set at 240 penalty units, which, however, are distinct from the offences, given that the state of mind of a person is not required to be proven in order to form all of the required elements of the civil offences, meaning that if an employer coerces an international student to work more than the hours in their visa permits then the employer will be committing one of the offences above to a standard dependent on the circumstances involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions satisfy a number of aims: to deter others, to punish those in breach and to protect migrant workers from coercive practices by employers that would find them in a breach of their visa conditions with respect to the manner that they can work and for the amount of time they can work during a given period of time. These exploitative practices against migrant workers need to be dealt with strongly. The amendments to the Migration Act in part 1 have been a very long time coming, much like the others proposed by the Migrant Workers Taskforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of the bill concerns the conditions in which an employer may be prohibited from employing temporary migrant workers. Through this part, the minister or their delegate can prohibit the hiring of additional workers on a temporary visa where an employer has underpaid or otherwise breached their obligation as an employer. The circumstances in which they can occur are also set out in this part, through how a person can be subject to a migrant worker sanction. Once a person has satisfied the criteria to be subject to a migrant worker sanction, the minister or delegate may declare that person to be a prohibited employer for a five-year period each time a person is subject to a migrant worker sanction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This part further outlines what happens once someone has been declared a prohibited employer. Namely, the penalty for allowing a noncitizen to begin work, whether for reward or otherwise, is two years imprisonment or 360 penalty units, or 240 penalty units as a civil penalty. This part also provides an affirmative duty to name and shame prohibited employers on the department's webpage. Part 2 also provides for the procedures for the 12-month period after a person's term as a prohibited employer concludes, with a number of interim conditions imposed, such as the requirement to report on any new temporary migrants that are employed during this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 3 of the bill increases the pecuniary penalties that currently exist for work-related civil penalty breaches in the Migration Act and for breaches under existing employee sponsorship obligations in the Migration Act and the Migration Regulations 1994. Part 4 of the bill establishes a framework whereby the minister or their delegate can enter into enforceable undertakings with an employer, labour hire company or other party that has committed a work-related offence or other such provisions under the Migration Act, which would include the new civil penalties and offences provisions within part 1 of the bill. Part 5 of the bill establishes a framework enabling an authorised officer to issue a compliance notice as an alternative to initiating court proceedings for contraventions of work related provisions of the Migration Act. Part 6 of the bill comprises a number of ancillary amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House, and I would urge all members to support it to put to rest amendments to the Migration Act that have been sorely warranted and called for by several experts and a number of parliamentary committees. By virtue of the lapsed bill in the previous parliament, the Migration Amendment (Protecting Migrant Workers) Bill 2021, you could even extend that through to the opposition, given they were in government when introducing similar legislation into the 46th Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one big step forward to eliminating exploitative employment practices against our migrant workforce. It's a workforce that Australian employers cannot take for granted, and employers can't abuse their fundamental rights and protections under Australian industrial law with wanton abandon without risking the full weight of that law by trying to do so. It has been flagged that this is by far not the complete cure, but these are measures that have been asked for now for a significant amount of time that will go a long way to addressing the problem and to minimising its prevalence in pockets of Australia whilst also maximising the likelihood of workers feeling comfortable enough to report breaches by prospective or former employers to the relevant authorities. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  I want to start at the outset with two clear, simple but powerful propositions. Firstly, Australia has done really well over decades as a permanent settler society. Secondly, as a corollary, we don't want our country to become a guest worker society where there's this temporary underclass that is exploited. I think most Australians would agree with me. Even if those opposite don't agree with those simple propositions, don't care about migrant workers being exploited or won't back action to do something about it, let's be very clear on the self-interest that every Australian has in stamping out the exploitation of migrant workers. Exploitation and wage theft don't just hurt migrant workers. They impact every Australian, as they can drive down wages and worsen conditions for all Australian workers. If unscrupulous employers can keep exploiting cheap migrant labour, there's no incentive to pay Australian workers properly or to raise wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an old-fashioned speech at the outset, but let's put a couple of facts on the table. The government, informed by evidence, has public policy informed by evidence—I know, particularly when you look at the climate change debates of recent years, that it's a shocking thing for the opposition. Fact: one in six recent migrants to Australia are paid less than the minimum wage—one in six! Recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and the same experience doing the same job. Temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce yet make up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act, and there's every indication that that's a significant underrepresentation of the real situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally, I think those statistics alone are shocking and morally wrong. Everyone in our country should be treated fairly, whatever their visa status is, whether they're here for four weeks, four years or 40 years and whether they're citizens, permanent residents or temporary visa holders. But that's manifestly not the case now, and it's been going on for years. The previous government had numerous inquiries over their decade in office, but they failed to do anything meaningful. I'll quote Professor Allan Fels, Chair of the 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce, who said that this exploitation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… has been severe problem for at least 10 years, there have been huge numbers of underpaid and exploited migrant workers and nothing was done about it. Now it is extremely timely …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that in June this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not abstract issues, though. They're real people. I see the member for Hotham here; we share a community in Greater Dandenong. In our communities, the majority of people are born overseas. They're not 'other people'. We have tens of thousands of people in each of our electorates in south-east Melbourne who are not citizens but here on temporary visas. They're our neighbours. They're the other parents at the school gate. They're the people who make your coffee. They're the people who clean your workplaces. They're the people who repair your cars. They're the people who pack the food in the factories for the supermarkets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enough is enough. We don't need more inquiries and more reports. We need action by changing the law, finally, and changing the incentives. That's what the government is doing. This bill is not every step of the plan, but it's an important part of the plan. For the first time in a long time the government is already out there raising awareness amongst employers about their obligations, actually getting out and visiting businesses. People may ask if we will stamp out all exploitation, and of course the answer is no. Some people will always do the wrong thing in any human society or any big service system in the economy. But we can and we must make real changes. The Liberals and the Greens political party should not play politics; they should actually vote for this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One important shift is to move the focus of compliance from the worker to the employer. I can't emphasise that enough. For too long, workers who were exploited for being in breach of a visa condition were then punished through the criminal system rather than the employers who were breaking the law. This practical fact has led to the clause in the bill that repeals the part of the Migration Act that, currently, makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions and so, effectively, to criminalise speaking up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this goes to what kind of country we want to be. There's undoubtedly a crisis of exploitation in Australian workplaces. People are too terrified to speak out when they're mistreated because of the high risk that they'll be criminally charged. Exploitation is not isolated. It has been proven, year after year, in report after report, to be systemic in the labour market. Unscrupulous employers, migration agents and facilitators have misused the visa rules and the visa system to exploit workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've talked about these issues over many years. It is hard for people—for most citizens, frankly—who were born in Australia, to truly understand the vulnerability, and the vulnerability to exploitation, that is caused by a temporary visa status and the power that an employer has over a person if they're on a temporary visa. That threat is a key driver of exploitation: do what I tell you, or I'll dob you in and get you deported. That's the basic power imbalance and basic threat. It's a key driver of sexual slavery, underpayments, wage theft, mistreatment conditions, empty promises of permanent residency and sham contracting—that threat of calling Australian Border Force and having them deported. There are stories where people have had their passports locked away and been sexually enslaved. These are not abstract. It's actually happening right now. As we debate this legislation, there'll be people right across the country hidden away in factories, on farms and in houses in the suburbs and the regions suffering this kind of exploitation. We have to reverse the onus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels's Migrant Workers Taskforce report in 2019. It recognises, as I said at the outset, that when people vulnerable to exploitation are mistreated we all suffer. It also inherently recognises the positive contribution made by so many workers and that Australia cannot take for granted that we're a destination of choice for prospective migrants. We're in the global competition for talent. This growing problem we have as a country, where it's reported around the world by international students and others that if you come to Australia you'll get exploited, is something we can't sustain. Morally, we can't sustain it in terms of the impact on Australians and their wages and prospects, and we can't sustain it in terms of our competitive position globally. So it's critically important for the government of Australia to demonstrate our strong commitment to addressing worker exploitation, because it's the right thing to do and it's squarely in our national interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill reflects our principle, if you like, that approaches to employment and migration have to work side-by-side, collaboratively, if we're actually going to address exploitation. The Fair Work Act and the Migration Act have to work together to protect workers, regardless of their visa status. ACTU president Michele O'Neil was spot on when she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Migrant worker exploitation is a national shame—we welcome the Albanese Government taking action to protect migrant workers from exploitation and to implement key recommendations of the Migrant Worker Taskforce—after years of inaction by the Coalition Government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She's right: it is a national shame. And the former government is to blame—as I said, not for every incidence of exploitation; of course you can't stamp everything out: there'll be people who do the wrong thing. But they are to blame for having these reports and, worse than doing nothing, going through a political charade and pretending they were going to do something but instead sitting by and overseeing this crisis of exploitation in workplaces across the country. There was a national debate in the wake of that shocking 7-Eleven scandal, which showed it was a scam. It wasn't just missed time sheets. It was a systemic exploitation and rorting of the labour and migration systems to exploit vulnerable people, undercutting the wages of Australians, hurting our international reputation and just doing the wrong thing. They could have fixed this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, they got the Migrant Workers Taskforce report in 2019—and fair enough. As the previous speaker said, to their credit, they responded. They didn't agree with everything, but they put out a government response and said, 'We're going to do this stuff.' They didn't do anything. It was a scam; it was a sham. Then they introduced legislation to the parliament, two years later. In 2021 they introduced a bill. But, as was so common with the former government, they didn't even bring the bill forward for debate. They introduced the bill, they got the press release, they got the speech up on social media—job done! They didn't actually care about stamping out migrant worker exploitation. It was all about sending another dodgy message before the election, to make people think they were doing something. They didn't even bring the bill on for debate, let alone allow a vote, let alone allow it to go to the Senate, let alone allow it to become law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It'll be interesting to see whether the opposition can actually bring themselves to vote for action on this, given their wasted decade of division, dysfunction, decay and denial, which exacerbated this problem, as they sat by and watched it grow. As we saw, the Liberals preferred temporary visas to permanent visas, which actually made it easier for unscrupulous employers to exploit workers. Not only did they sit by and do nothing, not only did they pretend to do something—a con trick—but they actually made it easier for employers to exploit workers. They also created a backlog of nearly one million visa applications—well over a million if you count the citizenship backlog, too. They neglected the basic administrative tasks by looking the other way. Instead of employing some public servants, as the government's done—I think over 500 new public servants in the Department of Home Affairs, working through that shocking backlog—they blew 92 million bucks trying to privatise the visa system. I think the reason they abandoned it wasn't because they figured out it wasn't a great idea but because they couldn't find anyone to give it to, as a tenderer, who wasn't a mate of Scott Morrison, because good old Scott Briggs wasn't there. They had to abandon it because of probity. It's been in the paper. That $92 million included I think a $42 million PowerPoint for BCG. I mean, it's good work if you can get it, isn't it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the bill's new criminal offences of using a person's migration status to exploit them in the workplace are welcome. That's recommendation 19 from the taskforce. They could have done that years ago. There's a new tool to prohibit employers who are engaged in exploitative practices from being able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period of time. That's recommendation 20 from the taskforce. They could have done that years ago. But the bill will go further. Higher penalties are proposed for people who do the wrong thing. There has to be a strong deterrent. As the government has made clear, we've got to reverse that onus, we've got to change the incentive and we've got to remove the disincentive for people to speak up about exploitation. It's a ridiculous situation that we've put up with for too many years, where an exploited worker makes a report and then they're threatened or criminally prosecuted, and the employer gets off scot-free.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will promote workers' ability to speak up and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections from visa cancellation, and that's just one part of the government's plan to protect workers. In the budget this year there was $50 million over four years to Australian Border Force. Shocking revelations—I do not envy the Minister for Home Affairs the job that you have to do now to clean up this mess, after it was revealed that there was almost no enforcement on shore, almost no integrity measures. I see the former assistant minister sitting over there. We've got the Leader of the Opposition. He set up the shemozzle—set it up to fail, as the leaked report said. He was a tough cop on the beat, tough on the borders. It turns out that over 100,000 people arrived on their watch, with fake protection claims that they let run up, with no onshore enforcement and no integrity measures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other problem about letting the million visas back up, as any of the migration professionals will tell you, is that you create a honey pot. It is better to work migration scams then because the department, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—the whole system—is so clogged and so overwhelmed with years of backlogs that it's a good return on investment to run a scam. They can come here, make fake claims, hang around for years working and sending money home, and eventually, if they happen to get deported, if one of the department's couple of staff find them, then they've made a lot of money. It's a good return on investment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I commend the bill to the House. I do genuinely hope that the opposition can bring themselves to support the bill—it's not usually in their DNA; it certainly runs against a decade of their record—and to ensure its quick passage through the Senate so that workers who are being exploited right now across our country can start to be confident of being able to speak up without fear of criminal prosecution and start to expose those employers who are systematically rorting and abusing the system, who are not just hurting the exploited migrant workers but driving down the wages of Australian workers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to go to the amendments concurrently. I congratulate the members and senators for a very constructive debate around what is a very important piece of legislation for the government. The Jobs and Skills Australia Bill 2022 was in fact the first bill introduced into this parliament. It was done so because it was the government's decision to clearly indicate that we were well aware that there were significant challenges to confront in dealing with skills shortages across our economy. For that reason, we introduced that legislation which established Jobs and Skills Australia. But there was more to be done to set up the governance arrangements and create, if you like, the architecture for it to perform its functions optimally and also work with government initiatives in the creation of jobs and skills councils. Those councils, of course, are tripartite bodies. They work in tandem with Jobs and Skills Australia. They'll provide the opportunity for a real economy insight into the decision-making of government. They will advise government and industry, allowing an interrogation, if you like, by the collection of data of JSA and the insights and views of industry to get the best possible outcomes when we spend taxpayers' dollars on education and training or when we're advising departments about what might well be needed in terms of skilled migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very happy with the development and the work that has gone into this very important area of public policy to date. I would also like to thank, as I said earlier, the members who participated constructively in this place and in the Senate. I am reporting on the Senate amendments. Constructive amendments were agreed to by the Senate—ones that strengthen the government's plans for expert advice and analysis, delivered by an explicitly tripartite body in a partnership between governments, including states and territories, employers and unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is telling who voted against this. Only the opposition voted against this. The opposition foreshadowed that it would not oppose the bill and would not oppose it as a second reading bill, yet it divided on the bill in this place. I think, because of that accidental division, it then decided to also oppose the bill rhetorically, having accidently divided on it, which is a shame. This is a broader and deeper effort to understand the labour market and more precisely anticipate the changing nature of the labour market so we can deliver more effectively education and training in areas of demand. Its predecessor, the National Skills Commission, did some good work, and I said so. I thank the National Skills Commission for that work, but it wasn't broad enough; it didn't bring industry into that engagement in the way that we wanted it to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really important moment. This is an amended bill, returned from the Senate with amendments that we accept. All of the crossbench voted in favour of the amended bill. Other than the opposition, everyone voted for the bill initially in this place as well. Two amendments were accepted in the Senate. We had already made amendments in the House. One amendment was to ensure that we provide an evaluation of government programs, particularly on how they relate to and potentially impact upon disadvantaged cohorts in our society and our labour market. I was very happy to accede to that amendment. Also, a further amendment was to ensure that, of the representation on the ministerial advisory board, there would be four distinct places for experts who would not be representing employer or employee organisations so that union representatives and employer representatives were clear and the other four would be able to provide advice without being an advocate of either employer or union bodies. We're very happy with that amendment as well because that reflected the government's position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a significant workload to ensure that we deliver the pipeline of skills to our economy, whether it's the energy sector, the care economy, digital or traditional trades—you name it; there are real issues. These amendments will be an improvement. I want to thank the members and senators for their work.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I rise today to support the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023, to strengthen employer compliance for temporary visa holders working in Australia. Migrants are incredibly important for our economy. According to ABS data, in the year 2019-20, 26.3 per cent of all jobs in Australia were held by migrants. That's over a quarter. That's 5.3 million jobs. Thirty per cent of those jobs were held by temporary migrants. That means temporary migrants held 1.6 million jobs. That's about 10 per cent of our labour force. Temporary migrants make an enormous contribution across Australia's industries to fill workforce shortages and do millions of jobs that Australia needs to keep our economy powering forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Migrants are incredibly important for our economy, and without them our economy would grind to a halt. They contribute so much to our local communities through their culture and language. They enrich what it means to be Australian. Migrants look after us, and, in turn, we must look after them. But, unfortunately, for all that migrants are doing for our economy, they are being exploited, underpaid and ill-treated in many parts of our labour force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today addresses the exploitation of Australia's temporary visa holders. The reality for these workers has been laid bare in numerous dire reports. The Migrant Workers Taskforce report in 2019 showed that wage theft from migrants is an issue that we haven't known very much about historically but is rife within our economy. The National Temporary Migrant Work Survey of 2017 revealed that as many as 50 per cent of temporary migrant workers may be being underpaid in their employment. That means, as a temporary migrant worker, you are as likely as not to be the victim of wage theft—one in two. The report goes on to say that the wage exploitation of temporary migrants offends our national value of fairness. It harms not only the employees involved but also the businesses which do do the right thing and are panelised by comparison to those that do not. The Grattan Institute in May 2023 showed that exploitation of temporary migrants in our labour force is widespread. Up to one in six of recent migrants are paid less than the national minimum wage, compared to just nine per cent of Australian workers—that means between 27,000 and 82,000 workers across Australia. Between 6,500 and 42,000 are underpaid by at least $3 an hour. This is wage theft on a grand scale, right across our economy, impacting the most vulnerable and lowest-paid workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These incidences of exploitation and wage theft are rife across many Australian industries. The construction industry, the second-highest industry employer of temporary residents, at 44,300 people, was described in a 2017 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology as particularly problematic when it comes to employment standards of temporary migrants. That report highlighted a range of areas of noncompliance with employment standards, despicable practices like the confiscation of workers' passports and some cases of actual physical abuse. In the food and beverage industry the data shows the situation is not much better. This industry is the most common industry to employ temporary migrants. More than 100,000 temporary migrants work in the food, beverage and hospitality industries—12 per cent of all temporary migrant workers. Before the pandemic, recent migrants were four times as likely to work in hospitality than long-term residents, but those who worked in hospitality—an industry which particularly relies on migrant workers—were found even more likely to be underpaid than those in other industries. They are younger, they're less skilled, and they're ripe for exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were so many examples across these and other industries of how temporary migrant workers have been exploited. The first was the simple underpayment of wages: workers being underpaid for the hours they worked, workers asked to work extra time without being paid, and workers having entitlements that they deserved not provided. The second area was unfair dismissals: without being given a reasonable justification or where there was no warrant for dismissal in the first place. The third was unpaid training. The fourth was tax avoidance by paying workers only in cash. These are practices which rob temporary workers of their rightful wages, rob Australians of taxation revenue, and create an unfair playing field where those businesses that are doing the right thing are disadvantaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse than that. There are incidents highlighted across these reports of migrant workers being pressured to break their visa rules, of misclassifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees, of workers having their passports withheld, and of threats to have the workers' visas cancelled. We've seen example after example of these horrific practices being perpetrated on Australia's temporary migrant workers. One of the most egregious was the case 7-Eleven. In 2020, 7-Eleven was forced to pay back $173 million to workers that their franchisees had ripped off. This was systemic underpayment of wages. In some cases workers were forced to withdraw their wages from an ATM and pay them back to their employer. That's how brazen it was—workers were forced to withdraw their wages from an ATM and pay them back to their employer. There was absolutely no regard for the law, and completely wilful ripping-off of these workers. The migrant taskforce report in 2019 determined that wage exploitation was systemic across the 7-Eleven network. It wasn't a minority of stores, it wasn't a few bad apples—the majority of 7-Eleven stores were involved in this wage exploitation. After these practices were first revealed to the public in 2015, 7-Eleven outlined a number of measures to prevent wage fraud amongst their franchisees. They made investments in technology to centrally record employee attendance, they made greater investments into enforcement and compliance through field investigations, and they created a noncompliance complaint hotline for employees. Still right throughout the economy the practices that were so rife at 7-Eleven are perpetrated across many different sectors. Another example highlighted by the Migrant Workers Taskforce report was the case of NQ Powertrain and July 2023 reports of this labour-hire company being fined $106,000 for exploiting migrant workers at its North Queensland farm. This exploitation included unlawful deductions from workers' wages and workers being brought in on the Seasonal Worker Program but noncompliant, and these practices were happening for years. In 2021 the Levitt Robertson class action for workers on the Seasonal Worker Program revealed workers were losing up to $300 per week from their wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think a lot about my electorate when I think about these cases. Parramatta is home to 113,000 people born overseas. That's over 55 per cent of the electorate's population. Parramatta is one of the most multicultural electorates in the country based on the percentage of the population born overseas. We have nine university campuses in Parramatta. People are drawn to Parramatta from all over the world to come here to study and build a life for themselves and their families. Many of those people, whether they be students or people on temporary visas, are here working in these arrangements. They are some of the most vulnerable workers in our community, people that have come to make a contribution to Australia and a contribution to themselves, but ultimately end up in exploitative workplaces. If I think about the scale of this challenge and apply it to the electorate of Parramatta, in the 2021 census 81 per cent of Parramatta's population were working either full or part time. If this data on the number of people exploited across the country were repeated across Parramatta, then one in six of those people would be exploited. That's about 5,000 people in my electorate working in exploitative conditions; 5,000 people being underpaid; 5,000 people living with the threat of a visa cancellation or passports being confiscated; 5,000 people living without the rights they deserve; or 5,000 people being forced to work overtime, not being paid for training or being forced into employer arrangements that aren't warranted based on the nature of the work they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the bill before us today is so important. The key objectives of this bill are, firstly, to strengthen employer compliance laws, making it fairer for Australian businesses who do respect the rules and ensuring they are not undercut by scrupulous competitors; secondly, to remove barriers which discourage workers from speaking up and seeking support; and, thirdly, to implement two recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. Specifically, that's recommendation 19:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the Government consider developing legislation so that a person who knowingly unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding new criminal offences building on existing laws in the Migration Act to make it a crime to coerce migrant workers into breaking visa rules and to make it a crime to unduly influence, pressure or coerce unlawful migrants to work—that's the first one. The second one is recommendation 20 of the migrant workers report—that is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the Government explore mechanisms to exclude employers who have been convicted by a court of underpaying temporary migrant workers from employing new temporary visa holders for a specific period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To implement this recommendation the government is introducing a new prohibition measure. It's designed to stop prohibited employers from hiring temporary migrant workers who are not sponsored—for example, international students—it aims to stop unscrupulous businesses from reoffending and exploiting more vulnerable people and it will help even the playing field for Australian businesses who employ migrant workers but have been disadvantaged by unscrupulous competitors for too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you put these measures together, they aim to stop unscrupulous employers from gutting their workers wages, to stop them from pressuring workers to break their visa rules and to stop workers from being threatened with visa cancellations. It's about making sure that our labour market is fair. It's about restoring the national value of fairness, which in this field has for too long been undermined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation goes to the core of the country that we want to be. We want to be a country that attracts people from all around the world, that is a magnet for talent, hope and ambition in the four corners of the globe, that brings people to this country in ways that we have across sequential waves of migration, that brings people to this country to build a better life for themselves and ultimately to build a better nation for everybody. But we undo that ambition and thwart that national objective if we don't treat these temporary workers with the dignity and respect they deserve, if we have one in two of those temporary workers being underpaid and one in six exploited in other ways. It is a national shame. It betrays our aspiration to be a great, multicultural nation, and that's why this legislation is so important.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  Australia is a proud migrant nation. That wonderful Indigenous leader Noel Pearson says that you cannot tell the story of Australia without telling three stories. First is the 65,000 years of continuous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture that is the foundation of our society. Then there are the Westminster institutions, the democratic norms and the rule of law that followed. Finally, there is multicultural migration that has so enriched our nation in recent decades. You can't tell the one story of Australia without telling those three stories. Indeed, today half of Australians either were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. My community is central to this success story. More than two-thirds of my constituents were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. Australia, as a result, is a prosperous, safe and cohesive country. We are the greatest multicultural success story in the world, and our migration system through the years has enabled that. In the past, when our nation has confronted crises and challenges, we've used our migration system to help us build a better country for the next generation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the previous government's neglect of immigration policy, this critical part of our national identity, this strategically crucial part of our economy, this foundation stone of our community, has created and bequeathed an immigration system to the incoming Albanese government that, as Minister O'Neil has said, 'favoured temporary migration in increasingly lower-paid jobs'—and these are the two essential ingredients of the worker exploitation that we know is occurring in Australia's workplaces. Those opposite left our migration settings on cruise control for a decade, and the system drove into a ditch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last decade, story after story has emerged about the exploitation of migrant workers in our community. I've said repeatedly in this chamber, on the other side of this place, that this was one of the great scandals of our time. It was one of the great stains on our national character. We had in recent years the infamous 7-Eleven case, where we saw intimidation and threats of deportation against staff. We saw systemic underpayment and doctoring of payroll records. Through the class action process against 7-Eleven we saw that one worker was being paid as little as 47c an hour and we saw that 7-Eleven underpaid their workers by $173 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen research that says 60 per cent of international students in Sydney earn less than the national minimum wage, with even more missing out on other mandatory workplace benefits, including casual loading. As in the case of 7-Eleven, these people are particularly vulnerable to coercive threats of deportation, which could mean fears about losing the opportunity to complete their study despite the huge financial and emotional downpayments made by them and their families. Because of these coercive threats, we know that many workers are terrified to speak up. A Grattan Institute report from this year found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experience and who work in the same job.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Grattan Institute report found that up to one in six migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. The report also found that, while temporary visa holders made up four per cent of the workplace, they made up to 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for a breach of the Fair Work Act in the year 2021-22.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report from Unions NSW found that over one in five workers are paid a lower salary because of their visa status or nationality, and migrant workers are also more likely to miss out on paid leave, overtime and superannuation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This exploitation is devastating for every worker. These are hardworking people contributing to Australia's economy who, to date, have fallen through the cracks in our system. In a country which prides itself on egalitarian values, a nation built on immigrant success stories, this is a national shame. It's a disgrace. And those opposite did nothing about it for far too long.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Grattan Institute said earlier this year, 'If we don't take wage theft more seriously it will keep happening.' And as Professor Allan Fels, the Chair of the Migrant Workers Taskforce, said in June this year, this exploitation:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing was done about it by those opposite during their time in government. This crucial area of national economic policy and national cultural policy was left on cruise control. The previous government did not act. In fact, they wilfully oversaw systemic exploitation of migrant workers across Australia. The 7-Eleven scandal, which rocked Australia, led to no action by the former government. The former government did not implement the key recommendations from the Migrant Workers Taskforce, which reported to the Morrison government in 2019. Two years after the publication of the taskforce's report, they did introduce a bill, but it was a bill which was never even brought forward for debate in this place, let alone for a vote.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migrant Workers Taskforce report was another report in a long succession that were left on the shelf by the previous government. The announcements were made, the social media posts were put out there, and they said, 'Job done!' The marketing was done but no substantive reform was delivered, and therefore the problem continued. The previous government sat on their hands, which pretty much sums up their attitude to resolving this systemic and devastating problem.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of doing nothing to solve the problem, those opposite preferred temporary visas to permanent ones. The effect of the migration system they presided over was actually to make it easier for crooked employers to target vulnerable migrant workers. They looked the other way. They allowed long-running abuse of some of the most structurally vulnerable people in our society to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're reforming these laws. That's why this bill is before the House. We have listened to the recommendations from the 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce final report, and through this legislation we are implementing recommendation 19 and recommendation 20 of the report. We've listened to recommendation 19, which was to strengthen our legislation so that any employer or individual who coerces workers, such as by using a worker's visa status to exploit them, is guilty of an offence. We've also listened to recommendation 20, in prohibiting employers and individuals who have been found to exploit workers from hiring workers on temporary visas. These reforms will provide strong incentives for employers to do the right thing by their workers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of inaction, the Albanese Labor government is tackling the exploitation of migrant workers in this country, and it's not before time. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 will establish new criminal and civil offences for coercing people to work in breach of their visa conditions or for using visa status to exploit workers. It will prohibit employers and individuals who have exploited migrants from hiring future workers on temporary visas. It will align and increase penalties for work related breaches. It will provide for an enforceable undertaking for work related breaches and compliance notices to employers who breach relevant Migration Act and Migration Regulations rules, and it will reform the law so that the exploitation of a worker may be considered as a potential mitigating factor when visa cancellation is under consideration. These reforms are not before time. The Grattan Institute has expressed its support for the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We support the Bill's expansion of the powers of the Australian Border Force (ABF) to crack down on unscrupulous employers and prevent employers found to be taking advantage of migrant workers from hiring temporary migrants.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These aren't the only reforms that the Albanese Labor government is making to our visa and migration system—a visa and migration system which is not fit for purpose and which creates vulnerabilities for workers across our economy. Since coming to government, we've slashed the backlog of visa applications, from just under a million in the pipeline to now less than 600,000, and the citizenship backlog is now less than 80,000; that's the lowest level in six years. In the last 10 years, not one MP in this House could do a street stall in the Australian community without somebody coming up begging for action on visa processing times—people who would jump through all of the hoops required to receive the Holy Grail that is Australian citizenship and were stuck in a bureaucratic purgatory. People in my community started to draw inferences about the conduct of the previous government. There are large parts of my community that believe those opposite didn't want visa, PR and citizenship applications to be processed, because they didn't think it was in their political interests, thinking those people would hold Labor values. That is something that was raised with me regularly in the electorate. The incompetence of those opposite—their lack of prioritisation for creating new Australians—is inexplicable without that explanation, in my view.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anybody who is worth their salt in this place will have spent a lot of time in Australian citizenship ceremonies. They're one of the best parts of the job. Looking someone in the eye who has just received Australian citizenship, seeing how important it is to them—you can't get through a citizenship ceremony in this country without someone being in tears. Seeing how important it is to these people, I think the failure to process citizenship applications was one of the great scandals of the previous government. It was just indefensible. We've gotten to work on fixing it, and the citizenship backlog is now less than 80,000—the lowest it's been in six years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also established a pathway to Australian citizenship for New Zealanders in this country. It's a crucial thing in communities like mine with big Kiwi Pasifika communities. These are people who lived in a state of limbo in our society, mates from across the ditch, equal in all ways except for their status in Australia. It's particularly harsh on the children of those families. It was a foolish decision by the Howard government, the consequences of which grew over time, and this Labor government is fixing it. We're dealing with the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also commissioned a review of the Australia's migration system, led by former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Martin Parkinson. That review described the migration system as broken. As I said earlier, this was a system that was on cruise control for the better part of a decade, and it ran into a ditch. It became more and more complex and less and less adequately funded, and it became less and less fit for purpose. We need a migration system that serves our nation by delivering the skills that Australian businesses need and the nation-building that our country was built on. Since this review was released, in April, the Albanese Labor government has been consulting widely on the development of a migration strategy, which will be released later this year. It will deliver a new approach to skilled migration, helping to drive productivity growth and wage growth while ensuring migration is better managed and integrated with the levers that make migration successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms to the Migration Act in this bill will ensure that migrant workers are treated respectfully and honourably and are paid what they rightly deserve. I would just emphasise to the House, in my capacity as the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the world watches how we treat migrants in our country. We're not a country of guest workers. We're a country where workers should be treated equally and fairly in the workplace. It's what our country was built on. When I am overseas, I am commonly asked by international peers about how members of their diaspora are treated in Australia, about their status in our community, about their status in our educational institutions, about their status in our workplaces. We need to be able to look our international peers in the eye and say that in Australia everyone is treated equally, everyone is treated fairly, there is no underclass, there is no guest work, there is no vulnerable exploited class in our society. The exploitation of migrant workers enabled by the previous government hurt Australia's reputation internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, these reforms will be closely observed. They will be important for our relationships across the Indo-Pacific—relationships with countries who send their students to our universities, relationships with countries who send their young people to our country on working holidays. They will be able to look to Australia and know that their students, their children, their young people will be protected from exploitation. They will be able to work here and study here free from coercion and free from exploitation. That's why these reforms are so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Giles has said, this bill recognises that when people vulnerable to exploitation are mistreated, we all suffer. It recognises the contribution being made by so many workers and the importance of addressing the corrosive nature of expectation in workplaces across the country. Worker exploitation hurts everyone and only benefits wrongdoers. It's up to government to stamp it out, and that's what this bill is about. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  Everyone deserves to feel safe and be treated with respect at work. It's a basic principle. It's a right we all deserve no matter who we are or where we come from. Being able to speak up at work without fear is also essential. If you aren't being paid correctly—for example, a correct wage—or if you're experiencing unfair working conditions, you've got to have the right to speak up and make that be known. Having protections in place to support people speaking out is critical. It enables accountability and fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately some of the most vulnerable members of our community have struggled to feel safe at work. That's just an unfortunate fact of the past decade in particular. Many are exploited by employers who feel it is acceptable to take advantage of those, for example, on temporary work visas. We're talking about a significant group of people in Australia on temporary work visas. Last year 137,090 temporary work visas were granted, adding to the estimated number of more than 1.6 million temporary migrants already living in Australia. Many of them are underpaid, harassed, bullied and unsafe at work. Unsafe conditions impact this group disproportionately. Whilst we hear their stories, many people don't know how to report incidents. They experience language barriers, for example, or are afraid to lose their job or their visa, and they sadly continue to be exploited as incidents are very under-reported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue is significant. Whilst people on temporary work visas only make up four per cent of their workforce, and 2021-22, the same group of people made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act—and, as I said, most of the incidents are unreported, so that is a stark statistic. The Grattan Institute report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Short</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hanged</span> also outlined just how bad the situation is. They found that as many as one in six migrant workers in Australia is paid less than the national minimum wage. That same group of migrant workers is also more likely to miss out on superannuation, overtime and paid leave. Many also face unsafe workplaces and sexual harassment. Recent migrants are also 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid compared to long-term residents who have the same skills and experience and who work in the same job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This exploitation not only hurts the individual and those around them but also ultimately drives down wages and worsens conditions in the workplace for all Australians. Unfortunately many people choose not to speak out on the mistreatment they experience due to fears that their visa will be cancelled or they will lose their pathway to permanent residency. I will give one example: a fellow by the name of Amir Bagheri-gol-roud-badi. He's an Iranian refugee on a temporary work visa. Amir is his 50s and has worked pretty hard within the construction and building industry. Amir told my office that he worked for his employer for an entire year—in a very physically demanding role, as you can imagine in construction—yet was not paid his wages at all. He was underpaid completely. It is absolutely shocking the way that he was exploited. His employer refused to pay him the wages that he was entitled to. They told him, 'You can complain if you want,' and warned him that no-one would listen to him, given he was a refugee on a temporary visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amir was also exposed to unsafe working conditions. In fact, given that there were very limited safety measures in place, he actually experienced a permanent work injury. He was too scared to speak out in case his visa would be cancelled or he would be deported. By the time he found the courage to speak out, it was too late. Amir hadn't sought the relevant documentation or evidence to support his case, so he was told he had no options to fight this, all because he was too scared to speak out and make a complaint earlier. The current system failed to protect Amir. He was too scared. The Albanese Labor government is committed to addressing this type of exploitation and many other forms of exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are just one way that the Albanese government plans to protect workers. As part of these reforms, we'll directly implement key recommendations made by Professor Allan Fels in the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. This includes new criminal offences for using a person's migration status to exploit them in the workplace—recommendation 19 from the taskforce. There's also a new tool to stop employers engaged in exploitative practices being able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period of time—recommendation 20 from the taskforce. This bill also goes further and provides high penalties for those who do the wrong thing. The government will also repeal the part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions, which has effectively criminalised speaking up. We want to encourage workers to speak up and report exploitation, and we'll do this by putting in appropriate protections from visa cancellations when this happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also provided $50 million to the Australian Border Force as part of the 2023-24 budget to be used over four years. The ABF targeted employers who were suspected of wrongdoing. These reforms will give the ABF new compliance tools. As part of this work, the Albanese government is working with industry, union and civil society through a co-design process to help design further safeguards within the visa system. Put simply, the government is committed to making it safer for people to speak up when they are being exploited in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of detail in this bill from paragraph 245AA of the Migration Act. There will be new criminal and civil offences being introduced in cases where people are coerced to work in breach of their visa conditions or are using their visa status to exploit workers. That penalty will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. It will be important to deter employers and prevent the exploitation of workers due to their visa conditions. At the moment, there are no ways to prevent employers who have been sanctioned under the Migration Act from hiring international students or backpackers, despite the vulnerability these workers face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In paragraph 245AYA of the Migration Act there will be new prohibition notices that will enable the minister or a delegate to declare employers and individuals as being prohibited from hiring workers on temporary visas for a period of time. The triggers for such prohibitions will include court orders and noncompliance with employment and migration law. The government wants to ensure that the employment law and migration law work collaboratively and towards the same goals. When this situation occurs, the minister must publish relevant details on the department website. Ultimately, these changes mean that employers will not be able to hire any temporary visa holders where they have exploited workers in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be stricter enforcement of breaches for those involved in wrongdoing, and penalties for work based breaches will align with the maximum available penalty under the Migration Act. Also under the Migration Act there will be work related offences and provisions made subject to enforceable undertakings, providing the Australian Border Force with additional tools to help them in their enforcement efforts. There will be a notice that formally advises an employer who breaches relevant Migration Act and migration regulation rules and provide the ABF with more tools to assist in their enforcement of that. Under section 116(1A) of the Migration Act, exploiting a worker can be considered as a potential mitigating factor when visa cancellation is under consideration. This will help encourage migrants on temporary visas to speak up if they're being exploited. It puts protections in place and sends a message that their visa will not be cancelled in these cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past 10 years our migration system in this country has relied on a large number of low-paid, exploited temporary migrant workers. We know they've been routinely exploited; the evidence is there for all of us to see. Over the past 10 years the former government, the coalition government, did nothing about this. It's I think a familiar pattern to all of us: they did absolutely nothing about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government also failed to implement the key recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. That taskforce reported to the Morrison government back in 2019, but it was never actioned. That's not a surprise. The former government became aware of the atrocious exploitation of temporary workers particularly through the 7-Eleven case in 2016, a situation that saw workers paid as little as $10 an hour, with franchise owners commonly paying workers for half their hours and forcing staff to hand back much of their pay in cash. Many of these individuals were international students. This situation led to 7-Eleven franchise employees being paid $173 million in underpaid wages, interest and superannuation to compensate them. The former government found out about this but did not feel compelled to take action. Instead, they preferred temporary visas to permanent visas, making it easier for employers to exploit vulnerable members of our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the crux of this. The Morrison government did a big smoke-and-mirrors play. The former prime minister went on about how he was going to do congestion busting in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, but particularly Sydney and Melbourne. He said, 'I'm going to reduce the migration numbers.' He reduced permanent skilled migration by about 10,000, and he upped temporary work visas. It was all smoke and mirrors. And I think it's very important to note for the House that while temporary work visas are an important part of the migration system—there are gaps in various industries and sectors that need to be filled—they cannot be the only way that people come in on work visas. It goes against the whole set-up whereby, particularly in the post World War II period, Australia's migration system and Australia benefited, frankly, from having millions of people migrating to this country to settle here permanently on skilled visas and to work here and become Australians—like my parents who came here and worked hard and became Australians. They settled here and built a life and built a home, for themselves and for their children and their grandchildren. That's what we want to see more of, because it's that connection to Australia and becoming Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as I said, while there is a place for temporary work visas, they can't be the replacement for that skilled and permanent migration that has built this country into what it is today. That's exactly what the previous government did. They played a game by increasing the number of temporary work visas. They knew exploitation was happening. They did nothing about it. Then they claimed they were reducing congestion—and bashed migrants at the same time. It's deeply cynical, deeply 'do nothing'—typical of the previous Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we have to protect temporary visa holders. We got a glimpse of labour shortages in the absence of temporary visa holders during the pandemic. As I said, we understand the value of temporary migrant workers and the rich contribution they make to our economy. But we have to make sure we protect these workers, that the protections are in place, because it is the right thing to do. I also acknowledge that without these protections the exploitation of these temporary workers will ultimately discourage this type of migration and lead us to experience more long-term net loss in economic terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is putting a stop to this exploitation. That is what this bill is about. Members opposite can huff and puff, roll their eyes and do all sorts of things, but they know the truth of this. They know we are taking steps to ensure that no-one who comes to Australia is exploited or abused. You cannot deny that principle; you cannot deny that objective. We're taking the relevant steps to ensure that people like Amir no longer fear speaking out when they are clearly being exploited—not being paid the wages that they earn—or are experiencing unsafe working conditions. These are basic principles for workers and for Australians. We're making these changes because people in this country deserve to be paid fairly and treated respectfully. That's what this bill is about. Exploiting workers is never okay. It's never acceptable. It doesn't matter what that person's migration status is. Whether they are an Australian, a permanent resident or on a temporary work visa, it is not acceptable. That's the standard we should be setting as a nation. This government is committed to protecting all the workers in Australia. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  Today I rise proudly to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. I joined the Labor party because of my passion for protecting workers' rights. It's something we in Labor have done since before Federation. It's something we will always do. It is the very foundation that our party is built on, and it's everything that we do and focus on. Since we've been in government, we've been responsible for a significant suite of reforms in the industrial relations space. Let's not forget that this is an area that had been neglected for almost 10 years while those opposite were in government. It was nearly 10 years when employers could run amok and focus on their profits rather than their people. It was 10 years when the most vulnerable in our society could be exploited due to the lack of empathy and care that was shown to them by the then government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just robodebt or the attacks on services; it was the lack of action in workplace relations that hurt Australians. People coming to our country were left unprotected and vulnerable too. As Professor Allan Fels, chair of the Migrant Workers Taskforce said: 'This exploitation has been a severe problem for 10 years. There have been huge numbers of underpaid and exploited migrant workers and nothing was done about it.' COVID hasn't been around for 10 years. Those opposite can't use that excuse any longer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was even after the national debate that occurred following the 7-Eleven scandal. The former government sat around and did nothing. Who's surprised? We'd all got used to that because it was the former government's response anytime it got tough. They ignored, and didn't implement, the key recommendations of the taskforce report. They knew of the crisis gripping our country, yet they wiped their hands clean of their responsibilities. Now that I think about it, it's how the Liberal Party always handle tough situations. Remember how the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook—the sook from Cook—handled national challenges like the Black Summer bushfires? He wiped his hands clean of the problem while sipping pina coladas on the beach at Waikiki. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government's inaction even extended to individual cases in their own electorates. Take Freedom Foods in Shepparton, for example, who were accused of underpaying their workers by 25 per cent in 2019. That was pre COVID. These workers were made to perform tasks not covered by the skilled workers scheme as well as being severely underpaid. The company also discouraged workers from talking to the union about their working conditions, saying that, if they talked to the union, they were getting on a plane. This is the sort of rhetoric that is both degrading to the worker and also utterly illegal. But it's the sort of rhetoric that was allowed to run rampant under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison mess. The complaint about Freedom Foods dated back years before the 2019 report, with the former Nationals federal MP apparently being told about it in 2016. What did he do? He did the same as always: nothing. This is just a further indictment of the former government's inaction on protecting all workers in this nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In primary school, we teach our kids to step in when someone is picking on someone else and to stand up and speak out for the person being bullied. Typically, the coalition are bystanders. They knew what was happening. They could see it happening, yet they chose to do nothing about it. Even primary school kids could tell the other lot that not stepping up and just being a bystander makes you as bad as the perpetrator. Migrant workers were left in the deep end, with the government happy to watch them drown. I'm proud to stand here today and say that this will happen no longer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Grattan report shows that one in six recent migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. This government sees the exploitation that migrant workers experience under the current system, and that's why we are committed to addressing it. We know that underpaying one worker isn't devastating just for them; rather, it affects the entire workforce. Also from the Grattan report we know that recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experiences who are working the same job. Allowing the underpayment of migrant workers isn't just a migrant worker issue; it has ramifications across the entire workforce. It drives down the wages of Australian workers—but that's what the other side like. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mistreatment of one group has devastating consequences on the entire workforce, and Australian workers will often suffer worse working conditions along with their migrant counterparts. By lifting up the most vulnerable, we lift up everyone. We are doing this by implementing the key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels's Migrant Workers Taskforce report. There are new criminal offences for using a person's migration status to exploit them in the workplace. This is recommendation 19: there is a new tool to prohibit employers engaged in exploitive practices to be able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period. This is recommendation 20: to further deter those who seek to exploit the system and their employees, we are increasing penalties to make sure that those who do the wrong thing experience consequences for their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce, but, in 2021-22, they made up 26 per cent of all the litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act. However, we know that tackling this problem through the industrial relations portfolio won't achieve the full outcome, which is why we take a holistic approach and give the Australian Border Force new compliance tools. These new tools given to the ABF are supported by the Grattan Institute, which says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We support the Bill's expansion of the powers of the Australian Border Force (ABF) to crack down on unscrupulous employers and prevent employers found to be taking advantage of migrant workers from hiring temporary migrants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make sure workers are empowered to stand up and advocate for themselves, we're repealing the parts of the Migration Act that has a criminal penalty for workers who breach their visa conditions. With these parts of the act removed, the government will encourage workers to speak out and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections for visa cancellation. The government will also raise awareness of employer obligations and substantively engage with businesses to ensure they understand their responsibilities and are equipped to do the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does this by working in six parts. The first part of the bill focuses on new criminal employer sanctions. These increased penalties will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. The second part will be focused on making sure employers or individuals who have been prohibited from hiring overseas workers due to breaches are unable to hire in the future. If an employer shows they cannot maintain the standard work practice, they should not be put in a position where they can exploit workers further. The third part of the bill aligns and increases penalties for work related breaches. This is aligning the current breaches to the ones within the Migration Act, seeing them increase from 60 penalty units to 240 penalty units. The fourth part of the bill is to make sure that there are enforceable undertakings for work related breaches. This part of the bill uses the Fair Work Ombudsman system to provide enforceable undertakings. The fifth part is the use of compliance notices to inform workplaces of workplace breaches. This will help promote compliance, like what is done under the Fair Work Act. The sixth part of the bill tackles other smaller amendments to the Migration Act, that, if a worker is having their visa cancelled, the worker can provide evidence of worker exploitation that could be a potential mitigating factor in the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that has been very near and dear to me. I worked in a shoe factory and watched migrant exploitation happen. This is what drove me to get to this place, to make sure people are treated fairly, to make sure they are getting the proper workplace health and safety training they need and to make sure they're not exploited because of their lack of English language or knowledge of workplace laws. This is something we should be doing more and more. We should be making sure that people who are vulnerable are protected. Usually, it's those people who are considered unskilled—although, I'd challenge 98 per cent of us to do some of the work they do, and I think we'd all fail. It's also about ensuring that people on the lowest incomes get the support they need and deserve to do their jobs properly and efficiently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Migrants are not just stats to be played with; they're actually people—mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, sisters, brothers—but they're also people who come here for a better life and who deserve a better life. They deserve a better life by making sure that their workplaces are safe and by making sure that unscrupulous employers are taken out of the system. We need to make sure that we do the right thing for every Australian who goes to work. Everyone who goes to work deserves a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. It also means they're entitled to a safe workplace, free from harassment, exploitation and abuse. This is something that the Albanese government does. The Albanese government stands up for workers and ensures they get the support they need when they go to work.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  I thank the member for giving me an extra 30 seconds, and I'll make good use of it. On Friday evening, at around about seven o'clock Western Australian time, when my farmers, miners, prospectors and small landholders were settling in for dinner and perhaps to watch a little bit of footy, some of the best news that they've had in a very long time came through in the form of an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> announcing that the Western Australian Labor government, the Cook government, had done a spectacular backflip on the Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Goodenough, you'd be very well aware, as a proud Western Australian—and I know you are—of this legislation and the sort of pain, uncertainty and grief that it was inflicting on the Western Australian community. It was going to introduce an extraordinary layer of bureaucracy for farmers, in particular, in my neck of the woods, but of course miners and prospectors as well. Anyone with a block of over 1,100 square metres, in order to dig a hole more than 50 centimetres deep or to remove more than 20 kilograms of soil, which is about a nine-kilo bucketful of soil, was going to have to go through this extraordinary process of due diligence, which was going to increase the complexity of doing simple tasks like building a chook pen or planting a lemon tree in their backyard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was going to make running a farm almost impossible. You would get up in the morning and, depending on the weather, you might say, 'Today we're going to go and repair that fence that needs a bit of work.' Of course, you would not have been able to do that, because there would have been a several-month process of getting approval for it, as a tier 2 event, so opportunities would have been missed. It was certainly going to damage the operational efficiency of miners, prospectors and farmers, among others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people who are sceptical about the reasons the WA government have backflipped on the Voice. Within seconds of that article going up, many of the commenters were pointing out that the Voice has been travelling very badly in Western Australia. People are speculating that the vote may well have a three in front of it. In my electorate, I wouldn't be surprised if it has a two in front of it. Many people were blaming the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act for the very poor reception of the Voice in Western Australia. That's yet to be seen; we'll see whether that is actually the case, and how genuine the Premier, Mr Cook, is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember that when the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, Shane Love, suggested just six weeks ago to Mr Cook that the implementation of this legislation be delayed for six months—just delayed, not scrapped, as they have now done—Mr Cook rolled out the old Paul Keating favourite, the old quote about the dog returning to their vomit. He accused Shane Love of dog whistling to calls of racism from his C-grade backbench. It's yet to be seen just how genuine Mr Cook is about rectifying this terrible legislation that they have introduced, but one thing that he could do in the short term to assure Western Australian growers, miners, prospectors and others that he is genuine is to perhaps sack his minister, Mr Buti.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Buti has shown industrial-strength incompetence throughout this process. We've had hundreds, if not thousands, of people turning up to information sessions to explain how this is going to impact their businesses. We had 650 farmers turn up to a public meeting in Katanning to express their dismay. We had 30,000 signatures on a petition collected by the Hon. Neil Thomson MLC. Mr Buti completely ignored all of that. He never turned up to one meeting. He never showed any interest. As recently as last Wednesday, he said that the rollout was going smoothly. So Mr Cook could show some good faith to the productive workers of Western Australia by sacking his minister, because to suggest that he is in any way, shape or form suitable to review and implement some more workable legislation is a complete and utter fallacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One very last suggestion for the Premier, in my last few seconds, is that if it is indeed true that the federal government lent on him to backflip on this, then he should be leaning on them to backflip on live exports. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Today I stand before you filled with immense pride and excitement at being able to share with you the developments that took place during my trip to Malaysia. I had the honour of representing the Australian government at the opening ceremony of NEXTDC's first overseas data centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. This significant milestone not only highlights the growing economic partnership between Australia and Malaysia but also marks a significant step forward in our collaboration on the digital front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In today's interconnected world, data has become the lifeblood of the global economy. It flows ceaselessly across borders, transcending geographical limitations, and driving innovation, productivity and growth. Recognising the vital importance of the digital economy, Australia and Malaysia have made it a priority under our comprehensive strategic partnership. This commitment highlights our shared belief in the power of digital collaboration and our determination to use it for mutual prosperity. The Australian government embraces its commitment to deepen economic links, foster trade, and promote investment with Malaysia and the wider region. This way, we unlock exciting new markets and opportunities for Australian businesses, who stand to benefit greatly from this significant relationship. As we forge stronger ties and facilitate the flow of trade and investment, we open doors to innovation, job creation and economic growth that will benefit both our nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NEXTDC's decision to establish its first overseas data centre in Malaysia speaks volumes about the confidence and trust they place in our economic partnership. I would like to take this moment to acknowledge and commend the effort of the Albanese Labor government in building up and reconnecting the neglected relationship with the ASEAN region. Through the government's dedication and vision, we have been able to foster strong connections with our South-East Asian neighbours. I would like to extend my gratitude to the foreign minister for her tireless effort in ensuring that our relationship with Malaysia is on track for progress. Her commitment to diplomacy and collaboration has played a pivotal role in strengthening the ties between our nations. Our thanks go to her and to the Minister for Trade and Tourism for the commendable job he is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This partnership between Australia and Malaysia in the digital space is not merely confined to infrastructure development. It is about fostering collaboration, sharing knowledge and promoting innovation. By aligning our expertise, we can address the challenges of our digital era together, driving the adoption of emerging technologies, enhancing cybersecurity measures and promoting ethical use of data. Our joint efforts will enable us to unlock the full potential of the digital economy, creating opportunities for our citizens and ensuring that our countries remain at the forefront of global innovation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I reflect on my visit to Malaysia and the opening of NEXTDC's data centre project, I am filled with optimism and excitement. The bonds between Malaysia and Australia continue to grow stronger, and it is through such collaborations that we shape a future in which our two nations can thrive together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to express my gratitude to the Australian High Commission for its warm hospitality and to NEXTDC for its commitment to strengthening our economic partnership. Together, let us seize the opportunities that lie ahead, navigate the digital landscape with confidence, and build a future that is defined by shared prosperity and limitless possibilities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  There are a lot of questions being asked about artificial intelligence at the moment. It's human nature to be fearful of the unknown and of change. Obviously, we need to look carefully at the implications of this technology, but, as we think about how we respond as a nation to artificial intelligence, it's useful to bear in mind some of the ways in which artificial intelligence is being used today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tools being used by services like YouTube, Netflix and Spotify to serve up videos or songs that we might like to see or listen to next are one good example of artificial intelligence in action, and many of us find it pretty convenient. These tools become better over time at working out our preferences. If you regularly choose eighties artists like the Thompson Twins, Alison Moyet and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, you tend to get more of these tunes served up to you—I know I do! The tools use data from previous choices you might have made. They also use data from choices made by other people. You might have chosen 'All Cried Out' by Alison Moyet. If a lot of other people who chose this song also chose 'Don't You Want Me' by the Human League, then it's quite likely that 'Don't You Want Me' will appear in your feed. The serious point is that that is but one of many examples of the way artificial intelligence is part of all of our lives, and some of the benefits it is delivering are profound. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited professor of neurology Dr Michael Barrett, a world-leading expert in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. He showed me computer images of brain scans and explained how his team had developed an artificial intelligence tool to look at brain scans and identify signs of this terrible disease. Such tools do not replace the work of radiologists, but they do allow radiologists to deal with higher volumes of scans and allow a given patient's scans to be seen more quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A similar approach is being used in scanning for many other conditions in medicine. Australian start-up business harrison.ai has developed AI tools used by radiologists, and it's estimated that about a third of radiology practices are now using some form of artificial intelligence to assist in their work. This is but one of many situations where a large number of images or a large quantity of video need to be examined, and artificial intelligence tools are increasingly being used for this work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endeavour Energy has worked with Optus, Amazon Web Services and Unleash live on a project to use drones to fly above powerlines to identify places where the line is at risk of failing. Typically the line gets hotter when it is nearing failure, and this is captured by infrared video. The drone captures this video and sends it back to be examined by an artificial intelligence tool, which then flags locations for human investigation. This kind of preventative scanning work was simply not being done previously but is now feasible thanks to artificial intelligence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian start-up company Trellis Data has developed artificial intelligence tools to scan shipping containers coming into Australia for biosecurity risks. For example, insects may have built nests on the outside of the container while it was sitting on the ground in another country waiting to be shipped. The tool examines images of the container from cameras located in the ports where the containers are unloaded from ships, and it flags containers where there's a risk. In a two-week trial period, with the cameras scanning containers from multiple angles in just four seconds, more than 1.7 million images of containers were analysed, with four per cent of containers having pests that needed to be removed. While the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is only able to inspect about three per cent of all goods manually, the benefit of using this artificial intelligence tool is that containers were scanned more quickly and efficiently. Rather than causing jobs to be lost, this tool allows a higher percentage of incoming containers to be scanned, and it allows staff to then have their efforts focused on a more detailed examination of the containers which the artificial intelligence tool has flagged as presenting a risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, in the example I gave previously, with Endeavour Energy using artificial intelligence, that system allows the skilled maintenance staff to be directed to locations where they can do preventative maintenance work rather than having to simply engage in physical inspection. As work they were previously doing is now able to be done by the artificial intelligence tool, those skilled staff are able to be deployed to other high-value and more productive work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that many businesses are developing ways to use artificial intelligence in a growing range of settings, generally to allow existing processes to be carried out more quickly and efficiently. Rather than leading to a reduction in jobs, in many of these instances artificial intelligence is instead resulting in an increase in activity. We need to think carefully about the risks that AI might bring, but we also need to be alive to the very significant benefits we are seeing from it every day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  This weekend I had the pleasure to attend the Flinders Medical Centre with state health minister Chris Picton and some of my state colleagues the member for Davenport, Erin Thompson, the member for Waite, Catherine Hutchesson, and the member for Badcoe, Jayne Stinson. Like much of the country, our health system is under strain, and the most obvious indicator of the challenge is ambulance ramping. Ambulance ramping is, of course, a symptom and not the cause of the problem, and it is caused by bed block in emergency departments and in the hospital. It was great to be able to announce that 20 additional beds are being fast-tracked to help address bed block. This is in addition to the extra 26 new beds already online at Flinders Medical Centre and repat hospital earlier in the year. Flinders Medical Centre is a key tertiary hospital that plays a critical role in South Australia's health system network, particularly providing services to Boothby, the southern suburbs of Adelaide, and the southern regions. The Albanese Labor government committed $200 million, matched by state Labor, to redevelop 40-year-old Flinders and bring it up to current best practice. We absolutely need these services to come online as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But wait—there's more! Prior to the last election, now Minister for Health and Aged Care Mark Butler announced that Boothby would be one of the sites of an urgent-care clinic to support the Flinders emergency department by giving patients with urgent but not life-threatening health conditions another treatment option. This will be a walk-in option, bulk-billed, no appointment or referral required. It will mean that emergency departments can focus on life-threatening conditions and those with less-serious conditions will be seen faster in more appropriate places. The tender for the Boothby urgent-care clinic has closed, and I am looking forward to what I hope is an imminent announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But again, there's more. We are investing in the Bragg Comprehensive Cancer Centre in the CBD. This is a $77 million federal government commitment that will bring together South Australia's leading cancer researchers, clinicians and technology, and will provide the best education and prevention services, treatment, and long-term care in one coordinated service. The centre will also feature a proton therapy machine which provides targeted radiation therapy, particularly for children or those with head and neck cancers where minimising damage to surrounding tissues is of extreme importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mustn't forget primary care. We have already cut the price of scripts by $12.50, and this has saved people in Boothby over $90,000 collectively this year. This will be followed by 60-day prescriptions being introduced in three tranches, starting 1 September. Enabling patients to fill longer prescriptions for medications that have been risk-assessed as safe improves medication compliance. We have all heard of patients rationing medicine or choosing which prescription to fill because of the cost—this reduces that barrier. We also know that the time when people are most noncompliant with medication is at the end of the packet, perhaps because they forgot to fill the script. With longer prescriptions this risk is halved. Of course, if your prescription is longer, you don't need to go back to the GP so often to get a new prescription, so GP time will be released for other patients. Longer prescriptions are backed by doctor groups, patient groups and nursing groups. I acknowledge the concerns of pharmacy owners, and we'll continue to work with them to address their concerns. The minister has already introduced a number of programs to offset the potential profit-reduction, and I am in favour of expanding scope of practice so that pharmacists can work to their full clinical scope, further freeing up GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to primary care, the other really exciting thing we are doing is tripling the bulk-billing incentive. I am sure all of us here have heard about the difficulties of finding a bulk-billing doctor anywhere in the country. In November, after six years of Medicare rebates being frozen under those opposite, it is intended that this change will make bulk-billing financially viable again. I hear from doctors that, while the Medicare rebates were frozen, the costs of doing practice weren't—the costs of their staff, of running the service and of the medical supplies weren't. This will make bulk-billing viable again. This government is committed to improving our health system, and we are getting under way at pace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  It would seem almost certain that the Western Australian government is to withdraw its Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act sometime this week. This is an outlandish, outrageous piece of legislation that I congratulate Western Australian farmers in particular for standing up to. I believe 650 attended a meeting at Katanning recently, and 400 apologised. It's what you get when people with no life experience draw up legislation about things they have no idea about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This act was so foolish as to say a farmer, or anybody, couldn't dig a hole more than 50 centimetres deep without getting cultural clearance; indeed, that they couldn't shift 20 kilograms of soil. You can get about 15 kilograms of soil into a 10-litre garden bucket. I've got a 60-year-old farm front-end loader that shifts one tonne at a time and I've got a slightly newer one that will do two, and many of my friends who are still farming have something that will shift four or five tonnes. Basically, any job you wanted to do on a farm would have needed cultural clearance. I'm so pleased it's gone, but I have concerns that it's not completely gone; that it will come back. I'm also concerned that they have been told it would be a good idea to get rid of it while the nation is considering the Voice. It comes back to getting Indigenous clearance to carry on work on properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I bring this to the chamber is that my community too has hit an issue. Kimba has been through an eight-year program to secure the right to host the nation's low-level radioactive waste management facility. Eight years ago I took this to my community. I said: 'I think there are good jobs on offer here. For a small community with a declining population this could make a real difference.' Just a few weeks ago, a Federal Court justice ruled that the minister at the time, Keith Pitt, was biased in his decision, and the project was disallowed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My opinion is that the court was erroneous on two points. The first was in giving standing to the Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation on freehold property in the first place, because we know that freehold property extinguishes native title rights. The second was in saying that the minister was biased. After a five- or six-year program to find a site in Australia where a farmer was prepared to sell their land to the Commonwealth to put the site on, after finding a community that was prepared to not only accept but welcome it—61.8 per cent of people in Kimba voted in favour of this proposal—and after two Federal Court cases saying it was okay, a third one, with a new justice, ruled it ineligible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that Kimba too will become a casualty of the government trying to sweep any confrontation with Indigenous groups out of the road before the Voice. I believe the minister for resources should be appealing this decision immediately. I sought a meeting with the minister last week. It was cancelled at 24 hours notice, and apparently she has no time to see me this week. I can only assume that she's not prepared to speak with me about this issue.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RAMSEY:</span>
                  </a>  Well, I am the most affected member in this chamber, I point out to the member opposite, and my community—this is the community in which I live—is the most affected community in Australia. I believe they should have their voice heard, but at the moment I feel as though we're being pushed to one side, all at the altar of the government's plan to get a Voice for Indigenous Australia up in the referendum. I may be wrong, but there are a lot of people who agree with me. The people in my home town agree with me. The way my community has been treated in all of this is really troubling me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of all that, the decision and the government's lack of response at this stage leaves ANSTO in a position where they have nowhere to put their waste beyond 2032. I'm trying to get a legal opinion on this at the moment. I understand that ANSTO had to have a plan to manage that waste beyond 2030 in place by 2020. That plan was called Napandee. They no longer have that plan, and I'd be very pleased if the minister or someone from the department could actually inform me as to whether ANSTO are operating in breach of their operating licence at the moment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  This evening, in less than an hour, the country will tune in to cheer on the Matildas in their huge Women's World Cup round of 16 clash against Denmark. There are a few mixed feelings in Tasmania because of Crown Princess Mary, but I'm sure we'll all get behind the Matildas. Tens of thousands are expected to fill Sydney's Olympic Park, and millions will be watching on screens worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's World Cup here in Australia has been a huge success already, with record figures for stadium attendances and TV audiences viewing women's sport. Stadium attendance numbers have averaged over 26,000, with over 75,000 at Stadium Australia for the Matildas opening game against Ireland. It's estimated that, over the tournament, two billion people will have tuned in worldwide, doubling the figures from 2019. I know when the bells ring to adjourn the House, many of us, particularly the assistant minister, will be racing out to find somewhere to cheer on our Matildas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As millions of viewers tune in, it sparks conversations about gender equality and women's representation in sport. It amplifies the voices of those advocating for equal pay, improved facilities and increased media coverage of female athletes. These conversations go further, moving into learning institutions and workplaces. When girls see women on the field in the World Cup, they know they can pursue their own dreams, and to hell with what the boys say! Encouraging young girls to pursue STEM, for example, helps bridge a gender gap in industries that are traditionally male dominated, fostering innovation and diversity. The fabulous STEMforGIRLS program in St Helens, which I support, works tirelessly to break down barriers that have no place in modern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's World Cup tournament serves as an inspiration to countless young girls who dare to dream big in whatever they want to succeed in. When they see Caitlin Foord and Hayley Raso competing at the highest level, they see role models who exemplify resilience, dedication and the pursuit of excellence. Not only are there champions and role models on the field, but there are people off the field making a huge difference. At this World Cup, my state is represented by someone with a very important role. Tasmania's Holly-Lace Ayton is the Matildas equipment manager at the tournament. It's her job to make sure the players' kit, training gear and equipment are pristine and at the right place at the right time. She sets up and packs away training equipment and ensures it's delivered to the next location. Holly has toured the world in her role with the under-20 Young Matildas in previous years and, in between, has returned home to play for her beloved Taroona FC and coach young Tasmanian girls, empowering them to be the best they can be. I need to mention Alex Aylott and the coaches at Launceston City, in my electorate, whose passion and dedication to the kids in and around Launceston every weekend promote not only health but inclusivity, teamwork and dedication. They're training the next generation of Matildas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of this competition echoes through other sporting codes, like Aussie rules and cricket, where professional women's teams are now a regular part of the sporting calendar. This percolates through community sport and, in just a few short years, we see the difference this makes, not only to women in sport but to children and also to men, to appreciate the fantastic role that women have in the sport. Not too many years ago, men would have been aghast at the idea of women playing full-on Aussie rules footy, but it's just what they do now. It's terrific to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last weekend, in between sitting weeks, I volunteered at the South East Suns Women's Football Club, celebrating the Indigenous round of the competition, and the New Norfolk Panthers junior soccer club, where hundreds of kids, boys and girls, descended on Tynwald Park in New Norfolk. Young kids are taking it for granted that boys and girls can do anything. When I was at school, girls weren't even allowed to do metalwork—we've come a long way. We've still got a long way to go, but, with every kick, every tackle and every goal, the Matildas are helping lead the way. Go, Tillies! You have the nation behind you.</span>

People feel like prisoners in their own home. What we need to see is action and change of legislation by the state Labor government. We had to drag the state government across the line to make breach of bail an offence, but now we really need them to stand up. People are too scared to go out at night. People are terrified to go to events. Their cars are getting carjacked on the streets. Their homes are getting broken into. People are being rammed in the back by stolen cars. There are criminals with machetes, and they're receiving no jail time. We need the laws to be stronger. We need the laws to represent community expectation, and we need a state government that listens to its people.</span>

                  <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  From the very largest of cities to the smallest of towns and most quiet of villages barely a community across Australia has been left unmarked by the loss and tragedy of war and conflict. Memorials raised in every corner of our country inscribed with the names of our service men and women bear testament to this. Over the past two years the village of Millthorpe, 1,500 people strong, has come together to search for those sons and daughters of their beautiful town whose names needed to be added to their war memorial at Redmond Oval. The Millthorpe and District Historical Society and the village committee worked tirelessly on this project and recently, on a clear winter's morning, the local community gathered at the memorial to see 15 new names officially added to the roll of honour. It was a day to remember, as families from all over the state came to honour their loved ones. I was privileged to attend as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the names added to the memorial was that of Major Colin J Flatters OAM, who was born in Millthorpe. Colin did two tours of Vietnam and served in the artillery during the Battle of Long Tan. Colin spoke of his service to our country, and his address was very significant, given that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding these names to the memorial, ensuring their service and sacrifice is honoured for generations to come, was made possible by the hard work and dedication of the Millthorpe and District Historical Society. I give a big thank you to President Bruce Chapman, Secretary Jacki Irvine, Collections Manager Hayley Lavers and Treasurer Rosemarie Amos. The project was funded by a Saluting Their Service grant, successfully applied for by the Millthorpe Village Committee, run by President Nick Anagnostaras, Vice President Richard Beach, Interim Secretary Mark Logan and Treasurer Helen Russ. A big 'well done' must also go to Ben Crombie and his team at McMurtrie and Co. stonemasons of Orange, who expertly installed the new plaque on the roll of honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another highlight of the day was catching up with Irene Chapman, who celebrated her 101st birthday that very day. Friends and family gathered to toast Irene's more than 10 tremendous decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small villages like Millthorpe thrive when community members volunteer their time and skills to make their corner of the country extraordinary. I'd like to acknowledge the team of volunteers who helped out on the packed Millthorpe fire festival on the weekend. A huge congratulations to the event committee of Nick Anagnostaras, Richard Beach, Michelle Slack-Smith, Helen Grey, Dane Morgan, Phoenix Kamsteeg and the dozens of hardworking volunteers who chipped in to make the opening night for the winter fire festival such a memorable one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Millthorpe, as you can gather, is an extraordinarily vibrant community. They are very active on all manner of projects. Honouring the service and sacrifice of those who have worn the uniform for Australia is obviously an obligation that they take very seriously and they do it very well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299964" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I rise to share that the inaugural Holt Family Fun Day in the scenic coastal village of Warneet in my electorate of Holt was a grand success. It was a vibrant event filled with smiles, laughter and an overdose of cuteness as parents and their children gathered to celebrate the shared spirit of family, unity and mateship that defines the community I am so proud to represent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset I acknowledge the organisations, volunteers and community members who helped transform this idea into a grand success. Their relentless dedication, spirit of service and constant commitment to our community are the pillars upon which such events stand. This event was organised in collaboration with Backpacks 4 VIC Kids, a local charity that provides essential material aid to displaced children who often have little more than the clothes they are wearing at the time of their displacement. Backpacks 4 VIC Kids were generous to donate goodie bags for parents, which consisted of baby-friendly items for the youngest members of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The main attraction for children at the family fun day, however, was the fire truck displayed in the car park thanks to Warneet-Blind Bight CFA, the local volunteer fire brigade. They were kind enough to let children use the fire hose on the truck and speak to parents and children alike about the importance of fire safety. I also thank the Warneet Motor Yacht Club, who offered their public hall free of charge in the spirit of ensuring the best for our community. During the event, many parents emphasised their happiness with the hard work undertaken by the Albanese Labor government, particularly with this government's suit of family-friendly policies. Through initiatives like cheaper child care and changes to paid parental leave, families in my electorate will be able to spend more time and money on their little ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who participated in the Holt Family Fun Day, contributing to making it a memorable day filled with joy and community spirit. I am immensely proud to represent such a vibrant and connected community, and I look forward to continuing the collaboration with Backpacks 4 VIC Kids for the rest of the Holt Family Fun Days we have planned for various parts of my electorate. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Despite Labor welcoming 1.5 million migrants into Australia over the next five years without any plan on how to house these people, we are seeing this government make even more poor decisions and savage cuts to infrastructure projects throughout Melbourne's eastern suburbs, particularly in my electorate of Deakin. For anyone across the country who's having to deal with road issues, congestion, a lack of parking and traffic bottlenecks, it's about to get a whole lot worse under this government when Labor not only implements its 1.5 million Big Australia policy but presumably goes forward with the cuts that it is threatening to local infrastructure projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Deakin, there are a range of projects that they either have cancelled or are threatening to cancel. The first is the Ringwood Station Carpark. I committed funding to 482 parking spaces at Ringwood Station. You cannot get parking after seven o'clock in the morning. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to get on the train and get to work and arriving at the station without parking. Labor is now threatening to pull the funding for this multi-level car park at Ringwood Station. Planning and zoning have been progressed by Maroondah City Council, who have worked very closely with me in utilising that funding. In the end, the Labor Party now are threatening the residents of Ringwood with being unable to utilise Ringwood Station and get parking in the morning. So we call on the Labor Party to backtrack on the threat of these cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen threats to cut the $50 million of funding for Canterbury Road to add a lane both inbound and outbound. Everybody who lives near Canterbury Road in Bayswater North, Kilsyth South and Croydon South knows that the traffic congestion on Canterbury Road is already at breaking point with more than 30,000 vehicles a day. I call on Labor again: do not go ahead with the cancellation of this project. A small but important project they're also threatening to cancel is the intersection upgrade of Tortice Drive and Warrandyte Road. It is a very dangerous and congested intersection in the morning for residents of North Ringwood. It's $4.8 million dollars, and the Labor Party is threatening to cancel this, even though the work is ready to commence. Sadly, they've already confirmed the cancellation of the $50 million upgrade to Dorset Road in Croydon for road widening, fixing turning lanes, removal of open drains—can you believe it, in metropolitan Melbourne?—and fixing potholes. So we call again on the Labor Party to reinstate that coalition $50 million commitment to Dorset Road. We know the Labor Party has absolute contempt for the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and these planned and threatened cuts just confirm that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I have spoken many times in this place about the incredible experience that it was serving with NORFORCE in Arnhem Land. Today, having just arrived back from Arnhem Land and attending Garma, I want to reflect on a few things. I caught up with Warrant Officer Class Two Tommy Munyarryun. It was great to see him again and great to see how far he has been promoted in that great unit, NORFORCE. There was also James Ghengi. Talking to James Ghengi, a soldier in NORFORCE, reminded me of a time when I was serving with them. It reminded me of the importance of listening to First Nations people regarding policies that affect them. We served together—James, Tommy and I—in 2007. You'll remember that those opposite, and there are still some people in the opposition from around from that time, launched the Intervention without consultation, and as a result it was incredibly divisive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NORFORCE were given a role with logistics, but essentially what we ended up doing was a lot of the cultural brokerage to try and explain what was going on with this imposition in their traditional lands, such as what the child health checks were all about. Many of the community were very fearful, because of the way this intervention was rolled out, that their children would be taken away—taken away again, in some cases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked James and the Yolgnu soldiers in my patrol what they thought I should do and what they thought we should do as part of this cultural brokerage work, and they said we should put up a big sign in front of the clinic saying in the Yolgnu Matha language, 'The doctors are here to see your kids and to give them a check-up.' And the families started bringing in their young children. It's just a small example of asking for advice, listening and taking that advice, and how that results in proper, practical outcomes, improving health and wellbeing. It worked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the very simple point of the Voice: taking advice from people is going to give better outcomes. That was reinforced for me this morning from talking to my good friend Dr Mike Freelander, who has seen the power of Aboriginal controlled health centres in his electorate in improving health outcomes. Obviously, he is someone who would know well the benefits that will come, such as the perinatal benefits—giving young kids the start that they need in life through that support. That's the Australia we want.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Two weeks ago we had the devastating news that the government are abandoning their commitment to implement the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full and on time, on time being by 30 June 2024. The minister has now said that that date will not be met, and we are none the wiser as to what, if any, commitment is going to be made about when the government believe they will be able to achieve it. But that in many ways is irrelevant, because it is absolutely unacceptable to abandon delivering this plan in full and on time by 30 June 2024. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The now Prime Minister, the then opposition leader, came to South Australia during the election campaign 15 months ago and made a very solemn commitment to the people of South Australia that an Albanese government would deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full and on time. Fifteen months later, that covenant with the people of South Australia has been broken. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the election, when the Prime Minister was announcing his new cabinet, there was an interesting decision that he made to move the now Minister for the Environment and Water from the portfolio she had held in opposition, that being education, across to environment. He made this comment:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My view is that Tanya will be outstanding in that area, but also particularly in the area of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, as well; it's very important that that actually gets delivered. Tanya is someone who can get things done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know now, 15 months later, is that the minister is someone that can't get things done. The Prime Minister might have known that all too well when he appointed her to that portfolio, given our understanding of the tension between the two. Nonetheless, the people of South Australia have been misled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Howard government that developed the Water Act, a bipartisan initiative coming out of the millennium drought, and that was passed in 2007. It was the then Gillard government that developed the plan that that act required. All constituent governments within the basin signed up to the plan on the basis that there were 2,750 gigalitres within the plan. South Australia signed up on the basis that there would be an additional 450 gigalitres, taking the plan to 3,200 gigalitres, which would be delivered by 30 June 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing has changed since the now Prime Minister promised he would honour that. Nothing has changed since then. There is no new fact or piece of information that could possibly be used to explain this, other than that he never intended to keep that promise in the first place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  It's been a really busy time in my electorate of Chisholm in recent weeks, and I want to provide the House with a few exciting updates regarding some of the activities. It's really wonderful to be part of a government that is actually investing in and delivering for the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a fantastic day for both the Waverley Blues Football Netball Club and the Mount Waverley Cricket club when we recently had the opportunity to host Minister Catherine King to reconfirm the government's funding commitment to the redevelopment of Mount Waverley Reserve and view the new plans for the pavilion. This funding, along with the support from the Victorian state government and Monash Council, will deliver a brand-new and expanded two-level sports pavilion, a complete renovation of the playing ground, new and expanded training facilities, and upgraded spectator and community amenities for the reserve. This visit was a great opportunity to view the Mount Waverley Reserve Masterplan, which will also include replacing the current clubrooms, a sports lighting upgrade, reshaping the oval—including improved fencing, drainage and irrigation, an oval circuit path and associated tree planting—cricket net relocation and new public toilets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One aspect of the redevelopment that I know was so welcomed by the tenant clubs, players and the community is the new female change rooms which will be a part of the upgrade. We know how important having a female change room can be when it comes to growing participation in sport. I make this comment, of course, just after the Australian Diamonds have won the Netball World Cup, and we're all looking forward to watching the Matildas tonight, so it is a really fine time for women's sport in this country. I had the pleasure when I was at Mount Waverley reserve of meeting the many girls and women who stand to benefit from this aspect of the redevelopment, who were obviously just as excited as I was about these changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another really important visit over the last few weeks was to Guardian Childcare and Education in Blackburn South, where, along with the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, the wonderful Dr Anne Aly, I had the chance to meet with centre manager Ashleigh Curnow and talk about all things early childhood education and meet with some very special young constituents in Chisholm. I thank Ashleigh and the team for hosting the minister and me and for taking the time to chat and share stories with us and the children. It was wonderful to hear about the important work they're doing in the space of early childhood education. I know that it's really important to my community, with more than 7,200 families in Chisholm standing to benefit from these changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the privilege, at the invitation of president Greg Male, of visiting the Monash Men's Shed in Glen Waverley, and I just want to note the important work they do in the space of men's health and providing opportunities for men to connect with one another in the community. It's always a pleasure to update the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I'd love to update the House on a wonderful event which took place in Hamilton over the weekend: Sheepvention, one of the largest rural expos which occur in western Victoria. I start by thanking the chair, Will Kinghorn, and the president, David Botterill, and all their committee for the wonderful work that they do in putting Sheepvention on. There are countless volunteer hours that go into putting this large rural expo on, and the committee does outstanding work in making sure that Sheepvention takes place year on year on year. Even when we went through the pandemic, they made sure it was done virtually.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this time everyone was back, out and about. The weather was good, and it was a fantastic Sheepvention. They had a guest speaker, Roger Fletcher, who came all the way down from New South Wales. He drove because he wanted to look at the countryside as he came down. He spoke very well about the opportunities which still exist for the sheep industry but also about future challenges that the industry is going to face. It was a very thoughtful speech by someone who is at the heart and centre of the wool industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, everything was showcased, whether it be fine merino wool, whether it be those prime lambs or whether it be the breeders. Of course, there are very important sales that take place. You'll see some of the best stud rams in the nation on display.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sheep industry makes an incredibly important contribution to our nation. It's a large generator of export revenue. It's also a large generator of jobs locally. Whether it's the breeding industry or those who are producing wool, sheepmeat or prime lambs, right across the board they make a significant contribution to our nation. Of course, it's wonderful to be able to have a stand there, and the local community from right across the region who come to Sheepvention get the chance to interact. I thank everyone who came up to me and was talking about the issues that were of concern to them such as the local roads and making sure that Dan Andrews does something to invest in our state roads, which are in such a poor state, or the concerns at the moment that farmers have with the cultural heritage laws, which look like they're about to be ripped up in Western Australia—but no-one knows what's going to take place in Victoria or nationally. All those issues and many more were discussed, and well done to the organisers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I rise today to speak about a particular constituent of mine and their NDIS case. I was initially contacted by Jayne Hewetson through her occupational therapist, who went on to tell us that they were raising concerns for Jayne's wellbeing should she not receive any NDIS. They'd applied and been knocked back continuously. When they contacted me, Jayne was in the Royal Adelaide Hospital with severe issues which she had managed to basically overcome. I have to say from the outset that Jayne is chairbound and completely dependent on her mobility scooter for accessing the community. She suffers from severe lymphoedema, severe arthritis and complex PTSD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first heard about Jayne, she was, as I said, in the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The hospital would not release her unless she had some ongoing care at home, because they had basically examined her and decided she needed ongoing care. They had applied to the NDIS and got absolutely nothing; they were rejected. That's when they came to see me. I was advised that they had applied for the NDIS but were refused for various reasons. I then took it upon myself to make representations to the minister on behalf of Jayne because I was very concerned for her. This is what holds up beds in public hospitals. People are in those beds without any support to go home. We could release many beds if the support were in place to do so. I made representations to Bill Shorten, the minister, who took a keen interest in this particular case himself. He asked for it to be reviewed and to look at why it was knocked back. Through his intervention in this case, Jayne finally received her NDIS and was able to return home, where her quality of life has improved immensely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last nine years, the NDIS under the former coalition government was neglected and underfunded, and it was always under constant attack from a revolving door of different ministers that would come and go. The former government left the NDIS at a place where it was not what it should have been. For the NDIS to reach its potential, it needs a reboot. That's what the minister and this Labor government are currently doing. Since we've been in government, we've worked to deliver on our promises, and they include getting the NDIS back on track so people like Jayne and many others that I've seen in my office get the services that they require.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first step we would have seen in the things that came out in the budget: the six-point plan, the NDIA workforce, the long-term planning, the addressing of spiralling expenses, better outcomes for supported independent living and, very importantly, elimination of the unethical practices that we have seen much of and the increasing of community and mainstream supports.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  Australian seafood is a delicacy, a world-renowned product that we take pride in sharing with the world. But this Albanese Labor government is putting the future of our seafood industry at risk. In a race to spruik an announcement on World Environment Day, the Minister for the Environment and Water made a decision to phase out N2 and N4 fishing licences by December 31 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">N2 and N4 licences allow our fishers to engage in set-mesh netting in offshore waters. Products like barramundi, grey mackerel, king salmon, flake, queenfish and blue salmon are all caught in this way. The phase-out was a decision that was made without any community consultation, and so many commercial fishers have been blindsided by this change—fishers in the electorate of Herbert, like Lound's Seafood owner, Colin Lound, who has owned and operated a net licence for 40 years. He is set to lose 30 per cent of his annual turnover with this change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision is cutting off the hand that feeds the nation, resulting in a loss of jobs and closure of businesses who rely on this source of seafood product. Further, a shift from wild caught to farmed fish will affect the sales in retail shops—along with the health of Australian customers. Consumers will be forced to eat farmed and imported fish from unregulated overseas fisheries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written to the Minister for Environment and Water, and I'm yet to receive a response—I wrote to the minister some six weeks ago. I also take this opportunity to ask the minister: what happens to the fishers, their employees and their families? Where do they go? What they do? But it's not just about the fishers or the local fish shops that will be affected by this change; Townsville based fishers, like Paul Ryan, have informed me of the ripple effect that this decision will have. The nets, the boats, the parts suppliers; ancillary trades and personnel; and the entire tourism industry will see a negative repercussion because of this change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister 's answer to support fishers through this transition is to buy back the N2 and N4 portions of their licences. This solution clearly shows that the minister does not understand her own portfolio. Our fishers have comprehensive licences that often allow them to fish for a variety of species using multiple techniques. Buying back a portion of this licence significantly devalues what is left, not to mention the other components that come with providing the service. Further, what happens to their equipment that is now obsolete?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the responses that the minister has given is that we don't want gillnet fishing on the reef. But we don't have net fishing on the reef; you can't put nets across the Great Barrier Reef, it simply doesn't happen. The minister needs to answer these questions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  On 28 July Australia and the Illawarra lost a magnificent human being. Professor Justin Yerbury AM was tragically taken from us, his loving family and community at the age of 49—far too young. Professor Yerbury, Justin, spent his life researching motor neurone disease, the very disease which ultimately went on to take his life. It's a terrible and relentless disease that eventually affected Justin's ability to walk, talk and even breathe. But it didn't stop him living life to the full, and having passion and purpose every day. He was driven by determination and willpower. He told the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Story</span> that he wasn't much of a scientist at school. He grew up in Oak Flats and he went on to become a world renowned molecular biologist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His life was shaped by terrible circumstances: MND first caught Justin's attention after it struck his distant uncle and then a cousin. It took the life of Yerbury's mother, grandmother and aunt, all in the space of just a few weeks. He himself was then diagnosed with the disease in 2016. He promised his mother that he would do everything he could to find a cure, and he kept that promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I knew of him as a professional basketballer for the Illawarra Hawks, a team I have been a passionate supporter of all my life. He had already at that stage completed a commerce degree but he switched to science at the University Of Wollongong, fuelled by the death of his family and loved ones. Nearing the end of his PhD at UOW, tragedy struck again: Justin's younger sister Sarah herself died from MND. She was only in her late 20s. I can't imagine how difficult that would have been for Justin and his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This news did not slow his efforts. He drew inspiration from the great Stephen Hawking—they met and discussed the disease in their studies at Cambridge. He was in New York, delivering a lecture on his groundbreaking research, when he felt that his thumb had gone numb—the workings of MND. A genetic test years ago had confirmed that Justin, too, carried the rare genetic form of the disease. And within 18 months, Justin required the use of a wheelchair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite grappling with the disease himself for many years, he continued to lead significant scientific research to understand more about it. He became the professor of molecular biology at the University of Wollongong and is recognised as one of the world-leading experts on MND. His research group was established and was dedicated to examining the disease and exploring strategies to observe motor neurone health. He received many rewards and recognitions, including the Order of Australia and the prestigious University of New South Wales Eureka Prize for Scientific Research.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The digital economy plays a central role in the lives of all Australians. We know that digital transformation and the growth of the digital economy have been game changers for our nation, for our economy and for our society. We take for granted many of the benefits of digital services and products, such as Uber, for convenient transport; booking a holiday through Airbnb; or finding an appropriate support worker for a person with a disability, through Australian companies like Hireup or Mable. We take for granted the benefits that services like these, and many others, deliver us. They make our lives easier. They provide customers with greater choice and convenience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The digital economy has allowed entirely new businesses and sectors to grow and flourish, creating jobs and prosperity. Just think of the various categories which simply did not exist 30 years ago—streaming video, mRNA vaccines, drones, low earth orbiting satellites and additive manufacturing are a few that come to mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking of low earth orbiting satellites, let me mention two of the many great Australian companies working in this space: Myriota and Fleet Space Technologies, both based in Adelaide, both using low earth orbiting satellites in innovative ways—one using them for services to support agriculture and many other utility type applications; and the other, Fleet Space Technologies, making very exciting use of them to support prospecting for minerals, allowing mining companies to do in a few days what would previously have taken a year or more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, globally, we've seen huge companies like Amazon, Apple, Samsung and Tencent achieving extraordinary growth. In Australia, there are plenty of good success stories as well: SEEK, founded in 1997, became a top-100 company with a market capitalisation today exceeding $8 billion; Atlassian, founded in 2001, now has a market cap of more than US$43 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pipeline of digital economy businesses was a major focus for the previous Morrison government. We also had a major focus on the space sector, and, again, the companies that I've mentioned are ones that demonstrate just how important space based technology can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nation, therefore, is making very good progress when it comes to the digital economy, and I was pleased to join a panel discussion recently at the Tech Summit in Brisbane, with Robyn Denholm, global chair of Tesla, an Australian businesswoman; Scott Farquhar, co-founder of Atlassian; and other tech sector leaders. I reflected there on the progress that has been made since I first got involved, in a public policy sense, in the sector in the late nineties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is much more that needs to be done, and, frankly, the current government needs to work harder. We need a clear commitment from the current government that the digital economy is a clear national priority. We need to work on driving digital take-up in sectors which lag, including the small business sector. A recent survey found that nearly a third of small businesses are still doing their record keeping largely physically; they're still collecting the invoices and chucking them in a shoebox, and, at the end of the year, taking them to their accountant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're not using cloud based internet accounting services like Xero, MYOB or many of the other service providers, then, almost certainly, you also don't have a digital sales and marketing strategy. And that means you're missing lots of customers and every year you're likely missing more customers as, with each passing year, the percentage of Australians who are digital natives—those who wouldn't think of going anywhere but online to work out where the business or product that they're looking for is to be found—gets higher and higher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to see a national digital identity system. This was a major priority for the Morrison government. There was a lot of work done—some $600 million was spent on it—but this has really drifted since the current government came to power. And we need more of a focus on the digital delivery of government services. Unfortunately, this government is more interested in responding to the pressures that they get from union bosses, who are much more enthusiastic about the 1950s-style backward-looking economy. But Australians are going in a different direction. They want government services delivered digitally. Our economy needs to be more digital, and that will continue to be a focus for the opposition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  The world has moved on a little. We cannot speak of the digital economy now as something separate from the economy as a whole. There was a time when we could, back in the 1980s and the 1990s, for example, when the widespread use of computers and the internet was new. Paul Keating, in the 1990s, spoke of the emerging digital economy. Now, almost everyone on the planet is walking around with at least one computer on their person every day. The digital economy is the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even what we still refer to as primary industries—mining and agriculture—are infused with the use of digital technology. To put it bluntly, pig farming is getting very technical these days. It shouldn't be a surprise that, when we refer, for example, to the Minister for Communications, we don't use the term 'minister for digital communications'. When we speak of the digital economy now, we need to be more nuanced, lest the term be meaningless. We can certainly identify and speak of the emerging technologies—all of which are wholly or partially digital. These include robotics, cybersecurity, new applications, payment systems, AI, quantum computing and others. The motion calls for a minister for digital technology. Of course, the minister for science and technology already holds this role; he covers the digital field well. In some ways, this seems to be a motion in search of an issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the member for Bradfield's motion is coloured and confused somewhat by the confusion in the last Morrison ministry! Senator Hume did have the moniker 'digital economy' tacked onto her assistant ministry of superannuation and finance, but in the areas of science and industry it became a little muddy. After 15 April 2021, the member for Cook was Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, and we're not sure what the then Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, the member for Hume, thought about that, nor what the Minister for Science and Technology, the member for Durack, thought about that—but it must have been very confusing. Australian voters don't have to worry about that now because they have a government with clearly defined roles; a prime minister with one job, which he's doing extremely well; and ministers who are very enthusiastic in their policy areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I can still hear the motion calling out from the far past: 'Where's the digital strategy? We had a digital strategy. Where's your digital strategy?' I can't cover all the relevant work being done by the government in this area in the few minutes left, so I'll just touch on payment systems, cybersecurity, robotics, AI and quantum computing. In terms of payments, in June this year the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer released the Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System. It included cybersafety, phasing out cheques, the broader use of digital ID, upskilling the workforce, the use of AI and many other facets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of cybersecurity, in December last year, the Minister for Cyber Security appointed the Cyber Security Strategy Expert Advisory Board and opened consultation on the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy. In February this year, the Prime Minister led a round table on cybersecurity. In March, Australia was ranked No. 1 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the country showing the most progress on cybersecurity. In June, the government appointed the inaugural National Cyber Security Coordinator, Air Marshal Darren Goldie AM, CSC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In robotics, submissions closed on 7 May for the National Robotics Strategy. The government will encourage investment in robotics and automation to invigorate the economy and improve dynamism and productivity, at the same time as ensuring a transition to safe and fulfilling jobs for Australian workers. In artificial intelligence, Minister Husic released a discussion paper in June. <span style="font-style:italic;">Safe and responsible AI in Australia</span> looks at regulatory and government responses and proposes several options to strengthen the framework governing the use of AI. Consultations have recently closed, and feedback will be used to build on the $101.2 million in the May budget to support businesses to integrate quantum and artificial intelligence technologies into their operations. In quantum, in May, Minister Husic released Australia's first <span style="font-style:italic;">National quantum strategy</span> based on extensive consultation with the Chief Scientist Dr Cathy Foley and with guidance from the National Quantum Advisory Committee. The minister stated that 'quantum technologies will be truly transformative'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I thank the member for the motion. No, it isn't time for a digital economy strategy. The world has moved on, and it is a digital world. We have strategies in the areas of payments, cybersecurity, robotics, AI and quantum computing, and we have more than one minister dedicated to those tasks at hand. To his point about small businesses continuing to use shoeboxes for their invoicing and the like: be assured that small businesses are not being overlooked in the movement and education for computing and digital technology.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  I want to commend the member for Bradfield for this very important motion and also the member for Hasluck for her contribution, in which she actually confirmed why we need a minister for the digital economy. She mentioned Treasury, the Assistant Treasurer, Home Affairs and cybersecurity, the Prime Minister himself, science and innovation with Minister Husic and also communications. That's the point: it goes across so many industries and so many ministries that you need one person developing the strategy that brings this all together. The digital economy is its own industry in its own right, but it also delivers productivity gains to so many industries. It is across all of government, which is why it's so important that there is someone—one person—leading that strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael Porter is well known in strategic management theory. I'm sure the member for Fraser would know him well. He would know Porter's five forces. Anyone who's been in business or done anything to do with economics and strategy would know Porter's five forces. Michael Porter said: 'If a strategy meets a goal: it's working. If a strategy meets a target: it's a success.' The reality is that, when it comes to the digital economy, this government has no strategy, no goals and no targets. There is no way that it can deliver success in a digital economy. We need it all brought together. We need someone leading it. The former coalition government had the 2030 strategy, which was a roadmap that had objectives, goals, targets and funding behind it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that industry is frustrated. I am very fortunate to have spent three years prior to becoming the member for Casey working in the digital economy. I've still got many friends in the industry. I speak to many stakeholders and many business owners, and they are frustrated. They are feeling let down by this government because they know there's not a strategy. As the member for Hasluck said, we are at such an exciting time with artificial intelligence, quantum and medtech. We know that the health budget is under significant fiscal pressure at the moment, and medtech is an amazing opportunity to not only help people with health but also take costs out of the health system. There are so many opportunities to create jobs and to provide more efficiencies, and this government doesn't have a plan or a strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big benefits of the digital economy outside its own industry is productivity. We know that our productivity isn't where it needs to be. It's going to be one of the key pillars that's going to bring inflation down and take some pressure off cost-of-living challenges, which all Australians are going through. In its five-year report earlier this year, the Productivity Commission had a whole section dedicated to digital technology and the important role that that would play in driving productivity growth for generations to come. It's transformational, but, again, we don't have a minster to bring that strategy together to drive that productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear that, when we're talking about the digital economy and that industry, we're talking about an industry that's estimated to be worth $315 billion over the next decade. It is an industry that is estimated to create 250,000 new jobs by 2025. That's $315 billion of economic growth and a quarter of a million jobs to be created, and this government doesn't see fit to have a minister for the digital economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it's also about productivity and efficiency. If you think about it, we're going to see many people going to watch the Matildas and the soccer tonight. They'll be able to sit at their table and not have to go to the bar. They can scan a QR code and order what they want. That makes it easier for that hospitality venue to get them their drinks and their food quicker, make sure that they're saving money and make sure that it's an efficient time for that business and a great experience for all those people cheering on the Matildas. I'll be one of those people tonight, and I'm looking forward to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this is about: driving productivity and greater opportunities for business, as well as improving experiences for consumers. We saw the recent AI report that the member for Hasluck referenced and, disappointingly, it exclusively looks at the risks of AI. There is nothing about the economic opportunities, which is why we need a minister for the digital economy taking advantage of these economic opportunities for our country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  In many ways this is quite a strange motion. It's quite misleading. I'm not sure what battle those opposite are fighting when we look at what our government is doing in having a holistic approach to the digital economy. This is a motion around something very superficial, about a name for a ministry, rather than the substance of what we're actually doing to achieve real progress in the space of the digital economy. It's something we take seriously and it's something we see that we need a whole-of-government approach on. This is why we understand the intersection of the digital economy across many portfolios, including Treasury and communications—to name a couple that my colleague and friend the member for Hasluck outlined already.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what we're doing. Let's look at how the digital economy is already embedded in the work that our government's doing. Frankly, I'm not terribly surprised that those opposite are stuck in the past and fighting a fight that has already moved on, because on this issue, like so many, they are looking backwards rather than looking forwards, which is our government's focus. Before Labor won government in May last year it really was only possible to characterise the previous decade of government as a decade of waste and neglect. That is perhaps in no way clearer than when it comes to the digital economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous decade saw the former government exhibit a startling lack of understanding regarding the role that the digital economy could play in determining the future of our country. This laziness caused both them and, more importantly, Australia to lose out on some of the biggest shifts in the digital age. With digital technology revolutionising sectors and propelling global economic development, unfortunately, Australia found itself trapped in the past due to the lack of vision from those opposite. That's a past that they are still seemingly trapped in right now, during this debate. Those opposite, satisfied with the status quo, selected a path of stagnation rather than lifting their vision, lifting their ambition for this country, embracing the digital revolution and investing in vital areas like digital infrastructure, research and development, and cybersecurity. We're all poorer for that failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of investment, of financial resources, allocated towards digital infrastructure, such as fast broadband networks, significantly impeded our capacity to contend with global competition. Other countries were creating state-of-the-art digital infrastructure while we were forced to struggle with sluggish internet speeds and spotty access. We've suffered a great deal as a result of the inability of those opposite to invest in the foundation of the digital economy. I'm really pleased that we're changing that in so many ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know cybersecurity has been an area of neglect. We know the devastating impact that scams are having in our communities, having lost $3 billion as a nation last year to scammers. It's amazing what difference a change of government makes in addressing this terrible issue. We are committing $86.5 million over three years to combat scam activity and online fraud. Imagine $3 billion ripped out of our communities because those opposite allowed scammers to take advantage of our communities. We are investing $58 million in funding for the ACCC to establish the National Anti-Scam Centre, which launched earlier this year, and we're also establishing an SMS sender ID registry, which will help block scammers from infiltrating legitimate text streams. This issue is of utmost importance to my community. I go around to community groups across my electorate and I speak to people about what they can do to prevent scams, because it is really unacceptable that so many people are being targeted by criminals in the way that they are, and it's a shame that we weren't able to take action over the past decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what we're doing in the digital economy beyond just that. We're discussing central bank digital currencies. Those opposite are still obsessing over ATMs. We're discussing seamless real-time digital payments. We're building a framework to ensure electric vehicles can be built in Australia, rather than goading car industries and other manufacturers to leave our shores. Those opposite say one thing and do another. They barely moved the needle on tech jobs when they had the opportunity, despite the platitudes we hear in this place today. As with a lot of things, we just get a lot of rhetoric but very little action, the opposite of our government. I'm really pleased to be a part of the Albanese Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I thank the member for Bradfield for moving this motion and for the opportunity to speak about the digital economy. I share the member's enthusiasm for Australia's tech sector. Australians often think of tech as foreign firms like Apple and Meta, but they don't always know what an incredibly vibrant and local tech sector we have here at home. We have homegrown unicorns such as Atlassian, Canva, SafetyCulture and Airwallex; we have a huge amount of world-class talent; and we have a dynamic venture capital community. It's a sector that already plays an important role in Australia's economy but one that could play an even more important role in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tech is important not just because of the jobs it creates or its contribution to GDP but because it is a key enabler of success for other businesses and because it plays, frankly, a direct role in improving our lives. It's a particularly important part of the economy of Wentworth, where I'm from. The tech sector is actually the second-largest industry of employment in Wentworth. I feel very fortunate to have met so many local people who are helping to grow and develop the sector here in Australia. I'm particularly grateful to those who could work anywhere in the world but have chosen to base themselves in Sydney and help build the Australian tech community. We have been enormously successful over the last decade, and I hope this success continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that success requires the support of government and effective policy frameworks. One of the challenges for the tech sector, I think, is how to coordinate a range of policy areas so that they all support the tech sector effectively in this country, because alternatively it can mean that ministers are working at cross-purposes, such as when the Treasurer is trying to build business productivity and the industrial relations minister is trying to build reforms that undermine it. A lack of coordination can also mean that important policy issues slip between the cracks, as we see with small business, which falls sometimes to the small-business minister, sometimes to the Assistant Treasurer and sometimes to the industry minister. It's a similar problem with the tech sector, where policy issues can fall between the Treasury, industry, education and skills and migration portfolios. There's a clear need for someone at the cabinet level to have responsibility for coordinating across these portfolios—someone to act as a single point of contact between the sector and the government and someone to be a champion for the sector from within government. Whoever is appointed should, as the motion suggests, prepare a digital economy strategy that will guide policymaking across government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tech sector has ambitious goals. The Tech Council wants to grow the industry so that a million Australians are employed in tech jobs by 2025, the industry's contribution to GDP is $250 billion by 2030, and Australia becomes the destination of choice for those looking to start and scale a new business. To reach those goals, the government will need to refine its policies across a range of portfolios. In the Treasury space, the R&amp;D tax credit and fringe benefits tax need to be redesigned, long-delayed payment reforms need to be implemented, and we need to ensure our institutional frameworks support the types of investment vehicles that work for startups and for tech companies. In the education and skills space, we need to lift our game with research commercialisation, improve the quality of some of our IT degrees and provide good pathways for skills development outside of universities. In the migration space, we need to make it easier for the world's most talented entrepreneurs, coders and others to relocate to Australia and make a contribution locally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the activities the government has put forward in these places, but I still feel very strongly that this coordination across the tech sector could play a very valuable role in improving the outcomes for the tech sector and for the broader economy. I'd like to see the Prime Minister appoint a digital economy minister and direct that minister to produce a digital economy green paper by the end of the year, with a white paper to follow next year. Ideally, this would be a bipartisan strategy that provides us with a clear roadmap for the digital economy, including long-term goals and actions it will need to take to support the industry's development.</span>

Our digital economy is now an integral part of the lives of Australians, whether it be e-commerce, e-marketplaces, online education courses, streaming platforms, social media, videoconferencing, e-health or offering innovative work-from-home solutions. According to the ABS, Australia's digital activity accounted for $118 billion, or the 6.1 per cent of our economy's total value, in the financial year 2020- 2021. Therefore, the Albanese Labor government's failure to prioritise the digital economy is incomprehensible. This is now directly impacting the future prosperity of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The digital economy is not just a passing trend; it is the foundation of our future economic landscape. It plays a crucial role in driving economic growth and creating new job and study opportunities for Australians. It is transforming age-old production sectors, from agriculture to law to health. Despite its undeniable significance, the government's policy approach to the digital economy has so far been woefully inadequate. It needs is a comprehensive digital economy strategy to guide us towards becoming a world-leading digital economy. Without a clear roadmap and concrete actions, Australia risks falling behind in the global race for digital supremacy. Moreover, the lack of sufficient funding allocated to advancing Australia's digital economy and lack of investment in digital infrastructure, research and development will limit our future ability to stay competitive and leverage the immense opportunities offered by digital economies. To make matters worse, the government's decision to abolish the role of the minister for the digital economy is regressive. This is a move that demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the importance of the digital landscape's significance and highlights the government's disregard for the potential benefits that can come from prioritising this vital sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are renowned for our innovative spirit and inventiveness, as evident from our impressive contributions to the world in various fields. From the hills hoist to the black box flight recorder to wi-fi technology, the winged keel, Vegemite and the cochlear implant, our nation has consistently pushed the boundaries of human achievement. Australians have similarly embraced the digital revolution, whether as innovators, startups or users. We therefore need a government that will support this revolution and prioritise the digital economy. I particularly want to recognise the role played by many tech companies within my electorate of Hughes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, I call upon the government to do three things. First, allocate sufficient funding to bolster Australia's digital economy. Without adequate investment, we risk stalling our progress and lagging behind other nations in this digital race. Second, the government needs to develop and implement a comprehensive digital economic strategy, a framework that outlines clear goals and actionable steps. This strategy must be forward-looking and ambitious, positioning us as leaders in the digital landscape. Third, we need a minister appointed that is directly responsible for the digital economy. This critical position is essential for coordinating efforts and ensuring that digital transformation remains at the forefront of government initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's lack of emphasis on the digital economy is a missed opportunity. Embracing the digital revolution is not just a matter of choice; it is a necessity for our nation's future growth and prosperity. It is time now for the government to step up and prioritise the digital economy to ensure a brighter and more innovative future for Australians. The coalition will be constructive here. We urge action and intelligent, constructive planning to support and bolster Australia's digital technologies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) recognises that the Robodebt Scheme, which was put forward as a budget measure in 2015 and was found to be unlawful by the Federal Court in late 2019, caused great harm to vulnerable members of the Australian community;</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) notes that despite the mounting warnings and criticism of the scheme, in the words of the report the Government of the time "continued to illegally raise debts against some of society's most vulnerable";</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) welcomes the Government's commitment to ensuring such a tragedy never happens again, and to carefully consider the recommendations from the report and provide a response to these recommendations in due course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals. In essence, people were traumatised on the off-chance they might owe money. It was a costly failure of public administration in both human and economic terms. Those are the findings of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme. There are 434,901 people who are known victims of robodebt. This includes as many as 2,125 victims in my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impacts of robodebt went far beyond those who were told that they owed money. Children, parents, family members, community members and loved ones were all impacted by this scheme—all impacted in so many ways because of the program that those who sit opposite operated for years, despite the warnings and the criticisms and despite the fact that we now know it was illegal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a way, we shouldn't be surprised that over these years the Liberals ignore the warnings, because if there's a chance to be nasty, if there's a chance to punch down on people in our community who we should be lifting up, then the Liberals will take it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, one of the chief proponents of the scheme in the coalition government was the member for Cook. The member for Cook has described himself as a bulldozer. When it came to welfare, to the social security net that holds our country together, he was—self-described—a tough cop on the beat. As both a minister and as a prime minister, issue after issue, he decided he'd just crash through, regardless of the impact on people's live. The royal commission found that the member for Cook 'allowed cabinet to be misled'. The commission found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He failed to meet his ministerial responsibility to ensure that Cabinet was properly informed about what the proposal actually entailed and to ensure that it was lawful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, despite these findings, just last week the member for Cook made it clear he will not be changing his mind on the role he played in the robodebt scheme. In fact, he dismissed the findings of the royal commission as 'disproportionate, wrong, unsubstantiated'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The now Leader of the Opposition has called those words from the member of Cook, his former boss, a strong defence. The Australian people have a right to ask the now Leader of the Opposition, 'Who do you support? Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the victims of this illegal scheme or are you on the side of the member for Cook, the bulldozer?' At the moment it seems like the Leader of the Opposition still can't bring himself to side with the victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vitally important that we do not forget the stories of the victims of robodebt, to ensure that we never see another government running a scheme like this. This is a commitment our government have made—that we will work to ensure we never, ever see a scheme like this again. We understand, as the royal commissioner said, that 'anti-welfare rhetoric is easy populism' that doesn't build up our country but just drags us all down. That, of course, is not what those on the other side have done. The nasty party are happy to engage in a bit of welfare bashing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rosemary Gay, an age pensioner, gave evidence to the royal commission. Rosemary said of the pension:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… (it) help[ed] keep my head above water financially. This benefit has enabled me to live my life with dignity and to pay my living expenses. It has been particularly important given my health issues and inability to work full-time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Rosemary was shocked when she received a debt notice in late 2016, and then part of her age pension was withheld to pay the debt. Rosemary said to the commission:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It turned my life upside down. It was just sheer terror that I owed a figure that was such a huge amount that I've never earned that much money. How could I owe that much money? I could not possibly owe that amount of money to Centrelink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rosemary, the pensioner affected by this scheme and whose life was turned upside down by this scheme, knew it wasn't correct yet, over years and years and with successive ministers, those opposite, who should have known and should have asked questions about what was going wrong and about why people were being slugged with these inaccurate, wrong and ultimately illegal debts, did not ask the questions. They failed these victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rosemary's story is just one of many shared during the royal commission. I want to acknowledge every victim, their families, the advocates and the whistleblowers, who, despite the roadblocks they hit, kept going. They didn't let others shut them down. They, I hope, are reassured by our government's assurance that this will never happen again.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  Today's motion is another step in Labor's relentless political attack on the social security compliance program carried out under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. It is deeply regrettable that the Minister for Government Services devotes such a large proportion of his time and energy to this unceasing political attack rather than concentrating on improving the delivery of government services to the millions of Australians who rely on them today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A clear risk of this royal commission is that it will make the Public Service more timid, more risk adverse and less likely to think creatively and ambitiously about how best to serve the government of the day and in turn the Australian people. High-performing organisations in the private and public sectors encourage their people to generate ideas and to take risks. Many of the recent advances in the government services space at the federal level have relied on emulating best practice in the private sector and in other countries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider the rollout of voice print, digital assistants, digital identity and video chat appointments, amongst many other reforms, delivered under the coalition. Consider in New South Wales the scrapping of the old motor registries, replaced by Service NSW model pioneered by then minister Victor Dominello and the New South Wales coalition government. These new ways of service delivery required innovative thinking from both the Public Service and within government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to do a better job of serving the public, it is important that public servants feel they are expected, encouraged and supported to develop, propose and implement evidence based public policy. It is also important that ministers can encourage and rely on innovative advice from their departments. Both of these desirable outcomes are, in fact, deeply threatened by the ferocious politicisation of the outcomes of the former government's income compliance program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's report makes it crystal clear that the central idea was developed by officials within the Department of Human Services. I do not say this to be critical or to point the finger; I say this because it is an example of what we want public servants to be doing—generating ideas. But how will any rational public servant in the future conduct himself or herself, at least in a world where the member for Maribyrnong remains in the parliament prepared to trash the careers of public servants if it will gain him a short-term political advantage?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally troubling is the novel doctrine put forward by the royal commissioner that, in the future, ministers should not feel confident in acting on the written advice of their departments. It is not in factual dispute that the then Minister for Social Services in taking forward a cabinet submission for the income compliance program did so on the basis of a formal new policy proposal prepared by his department which said on its face that no legislative amendments would be required to implement the proposal. Yet the royal commissioner says the then minister was under a duty to second-guess and to doubt this advice and, because he accepted it and took it forward to cabinet, he in some way had breached his duty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, with respect, this conclusion makes no sense and is very bad for public administration. It is, yet again, a regrettable consequence of the ferocious politicisation of this matter, carried out by the member for Maribyrnong. Let us be clear. Our governments, the former Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, made mistakes with the Income Compliance Program. They were made based on the clear advice of the Public Service that the program was lawful. Once that advice changed, we acknowledged the mistakes on our watch, and we fixed it on our watch. The incorrectly raised debts were cancelled, all who had paid such a debt had it refunded or had their debt zeroed, and the then Prime Minister apologised to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One other troubling consequence of the member for Maribyrnong's royal commission is that it appears to reject the idea that there should be continuing scrutiny over the validity of social services payments and an ongoing process to identify instances of overpayment, whether innocent or fraudulent. To the extent that the royal commissioner puts this proposition, I express strong disagreement with it. Every dollar paid in social services benefits is a dollar raised from a hardworking Australian taxpayer, and taxpayers rightly expect that there are controls in place so that social services benefits do not go to people who are not entitled to receive them under the law. It's very important we draw the right lessons from this royal commission.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  For more than 2,000 people in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury, getting a letter telling them that they'd been overpaid a social security benefit was the start of a long-running nightmare. Before it had a name, it was a threatening letter, often from a debt collector, with a payment due date and a series of instructions but no explanation as to how the debt was calculated. I saw those letters. They were cold, impersonal and, as we now know, largely automated. We now know that it was robodebt. For the pensioners, students, disability pension holders and many others who were sent these letters, the royal commission findings brought down last month show that they were among 435,000 people who were targeted by their own government in a cruel and unlawful scheme from July 2015 to November 2019. The scheme was finally paused but not before it unlawfully raised $1.8 billion of debt against approximately 435,000 Australian. The royal commission into robodebt was our election commitment to get to the bottom of what happened, why and how, and to make sure it can never be repeated. We established the royal commission on 20 August last year, and the final report was delivered within 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth remembering how robodebt was designed. Under the scheme, some Centrelink debts were calculated using averaged Australian tax office income information. Averaging was applied where there was no explanation of discrepancies between income that recipients had reported to Services Australia and income data from the ATO. It was a blunt instrument with little but mostly no human oversight. In November 2019, on the day that ministers and senior public servants would have given evidence in the trial of the class action on this matter, the Commonwealth finally admitted it had no legal basis to raise these debts. The use of averaging ATO data as the sole basis for raising debts stopped. Justice Murphy, the judge presiding over the case, approved the largest class action settlement in Australian history, describing the scheme as a 'shameful chapter' and a 'massive failure in public administration'. Fast-forward 3½ years, and Commissioner Holmes has delivered her final report of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme. What we saw in the 46 days of public hearings and what we heard from more than 100 witnesses was distressing and heartbreaking, with stories of how people who relied on the safety net were in fact hounded by their government with no means of fighting back. It was action where the major decisions were signed off by the former coalition cabinet, of which the current Leader of the Opposition was a member. After we announced a royal commission, the opposition leader called it nothing more than a political 'witch-hunt'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been reported about the findings of the royal commission on various ministers involved and comments made about them. But I want to highlight comments about the former self-styled senator for Western Sydney, Senator Marise Payne, who was the minister for human services. I note that more than 4,700 people in the Penrith area, the seat of Lindsay, received debts on top of those in Macquarie and across Western Sydney. We would have tens of thousands of people who received debts under this scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Minister for Human Services is talked about by the commissioner, who says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister for Human Services, Ms Payne, could not remember whether the need for legislation in relation to the income averaging proposal was raised with her; she could not recall what happened to the advice that legislative change was needed and she did not have a record. Ms Payne did not remember anybody coming up with a proposal other than income averaging as a means of using ATO data. She did not have any specific recall how the question of legislative change for the proposal had disappeared and there was no material to inform her. This series of disparate and unsatisfactory answers would have the makings of a child's nursery rhyme if it were not so serious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence before the Commission was that fraud in the welfare system was miniscule, but that is not the impression one would get from what ministers responsible for social security payments have said over the years.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  The royal commission puts it very simply:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals. … It was a costly failure of public administration, in both human and economic terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those costs include lives, unjustified financial hardship for thousands, stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health problems for many. In the end, an illegal mechanism touted to raise at least $1.8 billion ended up costing the budget $1.7 billion, not counting the below-the-line costs within the government or indeed of the royal commission itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report of the commission is an extraordinary document. Its preface deserves pinning to the wall of every minister's office and of every public servant's office as well. It reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is remarkable how little interest there seems to have been in ensuring the Scheme's legality … and the lengths to which public servants were prepared to go to oblige ministers on a quest for savings. Truly dismaying was the revelation of dishonesty and collusion to prevent the Scheme's lack of legal foundation coming to light.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only a week since the government pushed the Public Service Amendment Bill through the House over the objections of many on the crossbench, including me. It was precisely what was apparent in the administration, or rather maladministration, of robodebt that led me to believe that the public service legislation was inadequate. Last Thursday, the Public Service Commission revealed that it had decided to investigate the conduct of at least 16 current and former public servants. It's disappointing but understandable perhaps that these public servants had taken their lead from the then Prime Minister, the member for Cook, in his observations about accountability and his view that the Public Service should be there simply to do the bidding of the executive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year before the 2013 election, the then opposition leader and soon to be Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, put it bluntly to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>, when he declared:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… what I'd like to be able to say to the public service is, 'Look, this is how we think it needs to be done.' Rather than relying on them to tell us, I'd like to be in a position to tell them on day one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's very different from the Westminster standard that the credibility of our democracy depends in large measure on a public service prepared and able to provide frank and fearless advice. In that regard it's telling that, in his initial response to the findings of the robodebt royal commission, the member for Cook defiantly declared that the inquiry's findings about him were 'based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of how government operates'. I don't believe that's how Australians expect their government to operate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just robodebt. Trust in government has been frayed by revelations of secret ministries, pork-barrelling, including sports rorts and car parks, the funnelling of billions to private consultants, the PwC scandal, dodgy offshore processing contracts, and the list goes on. It's going to take a lot to rebuild public confidence. The Australian electoral study points out that just 12 per cent of respondents believe the government is being run for all the people, only 30 per cent of Australians trust government and seven out of 10 believe that politicians are more interested in looking after themselves than the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the Public Service Amendment Bill, one central question is: what are this government's plans for strengthening merit based appointments, as recommended by the Thodey review, and to constrain the ability of the Prime Minister of the day to terminate appointments? A clear statement of intent and a timetable for action would be a good start if this government plans to put its money where its mouth is on integrity—as would some clear indications from the government for a timetable to implement the key recommendations of the royal commission's report about government services: notably, the establishment of a customer experience reference group, which would provide streamlined insight to government regarding the experiences of people accessing income support, and that make more face-to-face customer service support options should be available for vulnerable recipients needing support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even from the interaction that my office has with frustrated constituents dealing with the variables of Centrelink, the NDIS and other services, the need for this is self-evident, as it is for accepting the commission's closing observation—considering its difficulty in accessing some key documents—that section 34 of the Commonwealth FOIA Act should be amended to 'make clear that confidentiality should only be maintained over any cabinet documents or parts of documents where it's reasonably justified'. Documents should not be labelled cabinet-in-confidence merely to avoid inconvenient disclosure. The faith of the community in the quality of democracy and our public service demand it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

And yet we had the member for Bradfield, a senior minister in the former government and now Manager of Opposition Business in the Reps, trotting out the same lines about hardworking Australians paying for social security and completely ignoring the words of the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address this point before I get to the body of my speech. Today's hardworking Australian is tomorrow's person who's busted their back. Today they're a hardworking Australian; tomorrow their relationship has broken down, they've lost half their income and they need support. Today they're a hardworking Australian; tomorrow they might suffer an emotional breakdown and need income support. We are in this together. This nasty politics of pitting hardworking Australians—taxpayers—against those who require income support at some time in their lives has got to end. It was a plea from the royal commission. Just stop it! And yet we had the member for Bradfield continuing it this morning. I'm so distressed to hear it because what we had in those years of robodebt were hundreds of thousands of Australians damaged by having debts unfairly raised against them—money they did not owe—that they were ordered to repay. It was a disgraceful and shameful chapter in Australia's history, and yet the member for Bradfield seems to have learnt nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For four years, from 2015 to 2019, robodebt unfairly and illegally racked up debts against innocent Australians—Australians who deserved help and assistance from their government but instead received betrayal and humiliation. Over four miserable years, robodebt billed $1.8 billion against nearly 435,000 Australians, including more than 4,300 in my electorate who had fake and illegal debt notices issued to them. Concerns about automated income average debt recovery, robodebt, emerged early. By late-2016, the Australian Council of Social Service was saying, 'You've got to stop this.' Our electorate offices—I'm sure it's the case for the Deputy Speaker and everybody in this chamber—were being inundated by people saying they were being forced to pay back debts they did not owe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By January 2017 Labor formally called for the program to be stopped. I recall, four weeks later, in February 2017, that I stood on that side of the chamber asking the government why it hadn't responded to our call for this scheme to be halted. I made many of the points I'm making now back then. And yet it continued till November 2019, nearly three years later. The member for Bradfield would have us believe it was some sort of divine prophecy that they decided to go ahead with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But why 2019, you may ask? That's when ministers and senior public servants would have had to give evidence in a class action against the Commonwealth for the scheme. It was only then, four years after robodebt started stealing from Australians, that the Liberals finally admitted that they had no legal basis to raise the debts falsely issued to 435,000 victims. That was it. It took that, and they kept it operational up until the last minute. Presiding judge Justice Murphy referred to robodebt as a 'shameful chapter' and a 'massive failure in public administration'—not just a failure but a shameful chapter overseen from start to finish by the Member for Cook first as a minister and then as Prime Minister. We pledged at the election that we would have a royal commission, and we put one up under Catherine Holmes, a former Supreme Court justice in Queensland and commissioner of the Queensland floods commission—a very eminent Australian. She delivered a report with 57 recommendations. It makes for very tough but required reading for every member of this House. The testimony of former ministers and senators and of senior public officials displayed disturbing levels of wilful ignorance, and the heroes were the low-level officers who tried to sound the alarm. The heroes were also, of course, the victims and their families who testified. Never again should we see such a shameful chapter in Australian governance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="235654" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I thank the speakers who have come before me. Australians expect us as the opposition to hold the government to account, and often that means that in motions like this we come up here and we fire back, but I won't be doing that today. There are times when we have to acknowledge when things were wrong on our side and there are lessons to be learnt. There are a few reasons for that. One is that it's not honest to do otherwise. Opposition is a time to reflect on how you can do better if your party is given the honour of being in government again. People won't listen to you when you actually have valid criticisms if you don't look within.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all come to this place with our experiences. I was a barrister for 12 years before this. In the early days of the scheme, someone I know well came to me and said: 'My daughter is distraught. She's got this letter, and I don't know what to do.' I looked at it and I offered to help her pro bono, which means you don't charge. The more I looked into this, the more I realised something was going wrong quite early in this scheme. Then I heard of others that were in a similar position. What struck me quite early on with that one example was the unfairness of it and how it was not competent. As someone who's a Liberal and believes in the sanctity of the individual, due process and the presumption of innocence, it offended all of those. It was illiberal, it reversed the onus and it hurt people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it hurt people on a large scale. We now know—I didn't know at the time—that close to 500,000 people were affected. I saw one number of 470,000. The scale of that did warrant a royal commission. It was warranted, and that process is something that we should review carefully. It is a 900-page report with many recommendations. We have an onus here, whether we're in the executive or in the parliament, like we are, not to blindly follow every recommendation. Despite the distinguished qualifications of commissioners, they're still people too, and it's an administrative inquiry, so we must do a proper reflection upon all of the recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also, going forward, recognise that we still have a duty to have a strong and sustainable safety net. I'm proud of Australia's safety net, and the member who spoke before me is right: any of us may find ourselves in the position where we rely on it. Even if you don't rely on it, I like to know that it's there for my fellow Australians when they need it. That system should be one that is compassionate. It should still incentivise work for those who can work and for whom work is available. It must be affordable and sustainable. We have that duty to those who pay taxes, and we also have that duty because of the impact that excessive spending will have on inflation, which affects everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when you look at this particular scheme, in trying to achieve some of those objectives it overreached and it wasn't properly scrutinised. At all levels of government, we should be conscious of the feedback loops when we hear that something has gone wrong. If someone drafts legal advice that says something might be illegal, that should be properly considered and passed up and down the chain of decision-making. We must never tell decision-makers just what we think they want to hear; we should tell them the truth all the time, and that should be timely. It seems, from my reading of the evidence that came before the royal commission, that there was a breakdown in that flow of information, where honest, frank and timely advice wasn't being properly moved up the decision-making chain and probably wasn't being properly considered as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme was illiberal, it was unfair and it was incompetent. We must all learn the lessons from it, and we must do so in a way that's above politics. There is excessive joy about this scheme by some, and we see it in the House every day. I ask for us all to reflect on that. I understand why that would occur, but there are lessons to learn about how to have a competent, fair system of welfare in this country, because Australians deserve no less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I'd like to put on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> that maybe the member for Bradfield should read the good member for Menzies's contribution. That was a fine contribution in this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a list of thanks. I thank the member for Jagajaga for moving a motion in this place on an issue of such importance not just to the people of Australia but to the people of my electorate of Spence. Through the sad, sorry saga better known as robodebt, we had over 6,300 victims in my electorate of Spence. That number was multiplied further by the families affected by vicariously living through their ordeal at the hands of the previous government. Without indicating that this is by any means over, I thank the Minister for Government Services and the Attorney-General for their unwavering efforts to disinfect this dark chapter of Australia's history with a dose of sunlight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the former members for Aston, Fadden and Pearce—although not in the same manner as I have above. Despite this not being the only point of controversy that brought about the ends of their political careers, to an extent they would inevitably have seen the writing on the wall at some point throughout the robodebt time line, no matter how late, and they realised that their actions were not compatible with being a member of this place, let alone a minister. This is not an issue that is a partisan attack, despite what some in the opposition and some elements of the media would have you think. This is not Liberal versus Labor. In the time I have known the current members for Aston and Pearce, I have developed a strong feeling that they would do so much better than their predecessors. For that matter, I would like to express exactly the same hope for the newly-elected member for Fadden as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the member for Cook. For some out in the community, it is a fact that they have a family member who is no longer with us, as a constant and eternal reminder of robodebt—something that will haunt them forever, something that nobody can take back and rectify. For others, seeing the member for Cook still sitting in this place feels like nothing more than a slap in the face. In this 47th Parliament, the member for Cook has delivered five speeches, three of which were nothing more than him defending himself against any number of scandals during his time as minister and, indeed, as Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Leader of the Opposition called a royal commission into robodebt nothing more than a political witch-hunt, which is what one must do when one is harbouring a coven within one's party room. It is one of the most systemic failures of government, coupled with the most egregious examples of those who have been found wanting by the final report having made every attempt to shirk any responsibility for the part they played whilst holding some of the highest offices in this land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the lack of responsibility shown by the ministers who were at the coalface of the scheme, I thank the brave victims of robodebt, families of robodebt victims, advocates and whistleblowers for coming forward, either to the royal commission itself or in the years leading up to this reckoning through all channels leading from the electoral offices of our local members of parliament—those are sometimes the best way to get the word up the food chain that something is seriously wrong. 'Seriously wrong' is an absolute understatement. Despite that, when in government all the way to now, those opposite did everything they could to downplay this—and I'm not talking about subjective things like undermining the role of the royal commission itself. I'm talking about the mistruths and using lines like, 'Robodebt was something used by governments on all sides,' or that it was in fact set up by the Minister for Government Services himself when in government. This is completely misleading all and sundry, or at least attempting to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that they knowingly tweaked the system that was used to help identify debts and then be checked by staff members. Instead, they had a scheme that took the human element out of it entirely. A computer punched out a debt notice, it was sent out to the unknowing victim of the robodebt and the onus was placed on them to prove their innocence. Some of these alleged debts could have been from years ago, meaning they were stuck having to find old payslips and bank statements, often at a cost to themselves, just to try to get this debt to go away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The moral of this story is that when you take the human element out of government, bad things can happen. We can't forget that lesson lightly, especially when we know that these acts and omissions by many senior figures in government and the public service at the time had a human cost attached to them. This is something that nobody should ever forget. I thank the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of the recent decision to cancel the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, it is abundantly clear now that the federal government must renegotiate the Olympics infrastructure deal with Queensland. That's because right now they're supporting an Olympics infrastructure plan that will see the destruction of a local public school, with hundreds of schoolkids displaced, and a much-loved public park that is one of the only bits of community infrastructure in one of the fastest-growing areas in Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the total cost of the Gabba demolition is apparently $2.7 billion, but Labor is keeping Queenslanders in the dark about what that actually covers. Does it cover the $100 million to move the school? Does it cover the warm-up track? Does it cover converting the stadium back into a cricket and AFL stadium after 2032? Does it cover the construction impacts on four major arterial roads that surround the stadium? We know, based on the average cost blowout of Olympics infrastructure, that the real cost could be as much as $6.7 billion—13 times what the federal government proposed to spend on social and affordable housing every year. It's very hard to overstate just how destructive this decision will be.</span>

It is clear that the EBSS community, families and local residents prefer that the school remain within the existing catchment area.'

                  </a>  The member for Moreton is over there interjecting, and, clearly—is it the case, then, that the Labor Party support destroying a local public school for a four-week sporting event? It's disgraceful. It's not only the school but also Raymond Park, which is home to a local football club and community garden, and which hundreds of people use every day. Never mind the fact that the IAC has said that they don't need to destroy the Gabba stadium and they could just use the existing athletic track at the Carrara Stadium. This is billions of dollars in public money that is being used to destroy a school and a public park for a four-week sporting event.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want the parents of East Brisbane State School and the broader area to know that we stand with them. We are going to fight as hard as we can to get the federal government to drop its support for this disastrous decision and, at the very least, renegotiate an Olympics infrastructure plan that puts the parents of East Brisbane State School and the broader community of Brisbane first. They must renegotiate a plan that is what was promised in the first place, which is an Olympics that has a low impact on the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The joke of it is that we keep hearing that this is going to have a long-term benefit for Brisbane. Right now, the long-term benefit for Brisbane is the destruction of a public school, the destruction of a public park, years of disruption and a huge infrastructure project that isn't going to give the benefit that Brisbane needs. What Brisbane really needs, by the way, is more public schools, more hospitals and more investment in local infrastructure, community parks, and public and affordable housing. Instead, we're getting this disastrous decision, going against the wishes of over 90 per cent of the local area. I think it's demonstrative of the fact that the Labor government will go around talking about how they care about public education and community infrastructure but in the same breath they will make a decision like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now their decision is to move East Brisbane State School entirely out of its existing catchment. Coorparoo Secondary College is a wonderful school, but when you're telling East Brisbane and Kangaroo Point—two of the fastest-growing areas in inner-city Brisbane—that they're not going to have a public school, what does that say about how much Labor cares about public education? What does that say about how much Labor cares about community infrastructure and public parks? Again, this is all for a four-week sporting event and could cost upwards of $6.7 billion, based on the blowout costs. Imagine what $6.7 billion could do for Queensland. We now know that what Labor wants to do with it is destroy a school and a park. It's disgraceful.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  I know the member for Griffith cares about education in his electorate, and I do feel for the East Brisbane community that will be moving down the road for their new education site. I've had schools closed down in my electorate and it's quite devastating. I know that the member for Griffith flies to Canberra to complain about aircraft noise rather than catching the train down here, but that's a matter for him. But, for the member for Griffith's benefit: while the Gabba stadium is in his electorate, the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games are about much more than just the Gabba. The best part about these games is that 85 per cent of the facilities already exist. The Albanese government isn't funding the destruction of the Gabba at all. In fact, we're funding the construction of a Brisbane arena, a new 17,000-seat indoor entertainment venue in the CBD, right alongside the Roma Street Parkland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know how many times the member for Griffith—who's just exited the chamber—has gone to a concert or a show at the current Brisbane Entertainment Centre in Boondall. It's quite a journey from the south side, and that piece of Brisbane infrastructure is certainly showing its age. Brisbane's live music and entertainment need a venue in the CBD with excellent public transport access. The new arena will have this link to a newly built Roma Street station, thanks to the Palaszczuk government investing in Cross River Rail. There will be construction of five new sporting venues, including the Breakfast Creek indoor sports centre, the Chandler indoor sports centre, the Sunshine Coast indoor sports centre, the Moreton Bay indoor sports centre and the Redland Whitewater Centre. All will be upgraded and all will be legacy assets scattered throughout south-east Queensland, not just in Woolloongabba and Griffith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be some upgrades, along with temporary structures, to nine existing venues throughout south-east Queensland: the Wyaralong Flatwater Centre and precinct; the Sunshine Coast Stadium; the Brisbane Aquatic Centre and precinct; Barlow Park in Cairns—that's outside Griffith, I think!—the Toowoomba Sports Ground; the Brisbane International Shooting Centre in Belmont, which is well known to the member for Hunter; the Sunshine Coast mountain bike centre; the Anna Meares Velodrome and BMX tracks; and the Queensland Tennis Centre, which is not in Griffith at all but in Moreton, in the suburb of Tennyson. These will be great legacies for Queensland and Australia. The games and accompanying infrastructure will be a platform to boost and inspire more community participation in sport and promote an inclusive environment where women and girls and Australians of all abilities feel welcome and have ready access—which brings me back to the Gabba, where this motion started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure whether the member for Griffith has visited the Gabba lately or spoken to people with a disability about access and mobility once they're in the stadium. But someone in a wheelchair having to use the service lift isn't acceptable in 2023 and certainly wouldn't be acceptable in 2032—nor would a major sports stadium not having dedicated change rooms and facilities for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A new Gabba will also deliver an eco-friendly facility. I do note that at one stage the Greens political party position, as put forward by the former Greens councillor Jonathan Sriranganathan, was to tear down swathes of Toohey forest in my electorate, destroying metropolitan koala habitat, just to save the Gabba. I actually saw a koala in the Toohey forest on Sunday. I think it would be a badly thought out policy to destroy inner-city forest for the sake of protecting the Gabba.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Swinging back to public transport, the Gabba will have, obviously, a new station right across the road, which will be crossed on an elevated concourse so there will be no more traffic problems. People in Brisbane going to the games will be able to hop on a train and hop off at the Gabba.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the member for Griffith has tried to compare Brisbane's Olympics and Paralympics with Victoria's cancelled Commonwealth Games. I point out that the Olympics is the second biggest sporting event in the world, sitting just behind the FIFA Men's World Cup and just ahead of the FIFA Women's World Cup—go the Matildas tonight!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These green games will see the world looking to Brisbane and Queensland and will deliver an unprecedented opportunity to showcase the state as a world-class tourism and business destination. It is also a chance to promote the Queensland arts sector. What a great opportunity for our musicians, artists and performers—and our First Nations people, because they're going to have a central place at the games. They will be the heartbeat, whether through song or dance or stories and connection. It will be an opportunity for the world to immerse itself in the world's oldest continual living culture: 65,000-plus years of knowledge, words and wisdom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paralympics and Olympics aren't just about the rebuild of an old and tired stadium. They're about people from all over the world putting their eyes on Brisbane.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300246" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BATES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  From November 2022 to February 2023 I ran a survey across my electorate of Brisbane, and I thank the 713 residents who took the time to share their views and have their say, particularly around the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The survey asked some simple questions: how do you feel about Brisbane hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and why do you feel this way; do you have any suggestions for ways the government can ensure the games have a positive legacy for Brisbane residents; and do you think that all infrastructure built with public money for the games should remain in public hands?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On multiple occasions, respondents indicated their concern regarding the impact of the games on housing affordability, an issue that continues to be brought up with my office by constituents. Between the 1980s and the 2010s, Summer Olympics related developments displaced more than two million people. There's a long history of 'city cleansing' in the lead-up to international events, as happened in Brisbane during the 2014 G20 meeting and on the Gold Coast during the 2018 Commonwealth Games. As a result of Expo 88, house prices in South Brisbane rose by 238 per cent in the 11 years before the event. That same trend has occurred in Olympic host cities around the world, and, given Australia's current housing crisis, this is extremely concerning. The 2032 games could provide an opportunity for the government to tackle the housing crisis head on by investing in publicly owned housing, by cracking down on short-term stays like Airbnbs and by capping rent increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Brisbane community overwhelmingly agreed that any infrastructure built for the games with public money should be kept in public hands. The athletes village, for example, will host 10,000 athletes and team officials for the Olympics and more than 5,000 for the Paralympics, all inside the Brisbane electorate. So, rather than selling off this housing, like we saw in Sydney and on the Gold Coast, this housing should be turned into beautiful, accessible, publicly-owned housing for anyone who needs it. My office is currently running a petition calling on the government to do just that, so, please, add your name to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities expect transparency in government, but neither the Labor state government nor the LNP city council have provided transparency around Brisbane's Olympic bid—or the planning that has been carried out since, for that matter. In fact, council held a closed-door meeting when they voted in favour of hosting the games, locking the public out and keeping the details private. This was the first closed-door meeting in 15 years, and the last time this happened was for the Clem7—a project now infamous in Brisbane, and one that went bankrupt. Compare this to Germany, where they held a referendum in the two cities that were considering hosting the games, Munich and Hamburg, and both cities' residents voted no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019 the Queensland government commissioned multinational accounting and advisory firm KPMG to analyse the economic impact of the games. It was initially estimated that the games would provide $7.4 billion worth of quantifiable economic benefits. Flash forward to May 2021: this figure was increased to $8.1 billion, but $3.5 billion of that was for ambiguous social benefits like 'health', 'prestige' and 'civic pride'. In November of last year it was revealed that the original $1 billion cost for the redevelopment of the Gabba stadium was not actually based on any business case or viability investigation; it just came from a press release put out by the state government. The Premier then announced that her government would assume control of the games' infrastructure projects and scrap the planned independent body, the Olympic coordination authority. This is extremely alarming and further entrenches a lack of transparent decision-making and community consultation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Brisbane residents should be excited by the 2032 Olympic Games. But we have to ensure that they are done right. Holding closed-door meetings, abolishing independent oversight bodies and making up cost shortfalls with 'civic pride' will not ensure a positive legacy for our city. We need an open and transparent Olympics, real investment in public infrastructure and housing and to ensure that anything built with public money remains in public hands.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I want to begin today by reminding the House that there are two parties in this place voting no to building more housing in Australia: the coalition, which is expected, and the petty, whingeing Greens. This is nothing more than a political stunt. They say we need to pick between housing and the Olympics. I have news for them: we are committed to both. If they really care about housing, why are they blocking the bill that would see more houses being built? Wouldn't building new houses right now be better than none at all? They are the definition of letting the perfect get in the way of the possible. If they were stuck in the cold, they would say no to the offer of a jumper because they wanted a heater.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will show some sympathy to those representing the Greens. I'm not shocked that they are so out of touch with everyday Australians. They've probably never played sport before in their lives. No wonder they can't see why the Olympics are important and why it's necessary to make sure that the games are of the highest standard possible. They just don't get it—and they are walking out of the chamber, once again. But, for me, it is the arrogance, over the lot, that is the frustrating part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing, education and health are all important, and they are also some of the top priorities. But they are not the only things deserving of funding. Just because the member for Griffith has never watched sport in his life, it doesn't mean it's not important to other people. Your own interests don't define what is and isn't important and what does and does not deserve to be funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport unites our country. It is a fundamental part of our national identity. Our country has never been more united than when Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympics. People still talk about it to this day. This is an opportunity for us to feel that sense of national pride and collective excitement again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens say that they speak for lots of different groups in society, but one group they seem to have forgotten are our athletes. Athletes dedicate their lives to sport. They sacrifice so much, including time with their family and friends. An elite athlete does this for moments like a home Olympics. Olympics are the peak for athletes, and it is rare that they get to share the peak of their careers with all that they love. An Olympics at home makes this more possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been lucky enough to go to five Olympics. I know what it means to be an athlete. I know what it means to the cities that host them, and I see the benefits to all those in our country who unite and cheer on our athletes and give them the recognition and glory that they deserve. But the Greens want to take this away. They want to burn lifelong dreams and destroy opportunities to inspire our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Olympics can light a flame in the young people of Australia and inspire them to work hard on their dreams. A home Olympics will be the breeding ground for our next generation of sporting superstars, and it gives current young athletes something to work towards. Athletes in this country deserve world-class facilities, and Olympics provide the perfect opportunity for them to be given these facilities by upgrades to stadiums like the Gabba. The new and upgraded facilities in Queensland will be used long after the Olympics are over. Just look at Stadium Australia in Sydney. I think we have made more than our money's worth out of that. It's now hosting one of the biggest women's sporting events in the world, 23 years after it hosted the Olympic Games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens make out that hosting the Olympics is all doom and gloom. There seem to think that there is no upside to it at all. They ignore the benefits, such as increased tourism and the boost to our local businesses and the economy as a whole. The Greens forget to mention the jobs that will be created by all the funding which goes towards the infrastructure. It's also an opportunity to showcase to the world the best of what our country do. The Olympics bring opportunities for a better future for our younger generations, because the world will take notice of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a very worthy investment. I support hospitals and schools, but, unlike the Greens, I can truthfully say that I support providing more homes and also the Olympics. May I just say it's also very disappointing to see the member for Brisbane and the member for Griffith not being here to finish this debate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) condemns the former Government, for failing to appropriately resource the AEC to take action to improve enrolment of First Nations Australians, including by cutting AEC personnel in the Northern Territory who were addressing these matters.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a proud moment for the Australian people and for the Australian government, because finally we are making huge strides in Indigenous enrolment. When we came to government, Indigenous enrolment was at 84 per cent. In just one year, we have raised this to 94 per cent. In one year we have enrolled 10 per cent of the Indigenous population. I want to thank the Australian Electoral Commission for its work. I know there are many hardworking AEC staff out there working with people on the ground to get them signed up to vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Voting is important for our mob, particularly in the Northern Territory. For so long policy has been made around and for Aboriginal people, and for a long time Aboriginal people in large parts of Australia didn't have the right to vote. This was structural and intentionally provided for in the same Constitution which some opponents of the Voice have been trying to say shouldn't have race introduced into it. Let's just remember how things were planned out by the framers of that Constitution. Section 24 said the numbers of House of Representatives members for each state would depend on the state population. Section 25 said, and still says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… if by the law of any State all persons of any race are disqualified from voting at elections … persons of that race resident in that State shall not be counted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the framers of the Constitution were expecting that, in at least some states, people would be excluded from voting on racial grounds, and that's what happened to Aboriginal people in Western Australia, in Queensland and, from 1922, in the Northern Territory. They were prohibited from voting, and the way it worked was that you were prohibited from voting in your state or territory jurisdiction if you couldn't vote in a Commonwealth election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That wasn't fixed for Commonwealth elections until 1962. I was born in 1960. At that time the parliament I now stand in didn't accept me as having an equal say as a non-Aboriginal person in this country. That is not ancient history; this is one generation. Section 25 of our Constitution still contemplates and accepts racial discrimination in relation to voting at the state level of government in our country. People ask, 'Why do we need a Voice in the Constitution?' Part of the answer to that question is that, without a Voice, the Constitution remains a document marked and scarred by our recent history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took us 12 months to increase the Indigenous enrolment rate by over 10 per cent. In the Northern Territory this could have been achieved years ago, but instead what we saw under the Morrison Liberal-National government was a huge withdrawal of AEC resources. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame. Don't go talking about what's good for Indigenous people now. You clearly didn't have an interest when you were in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government cares. Come the 2023 referendum, more Indigenous people will have a say than ever before. In the Northern Territory there has been significant headway. For our remote communities this is huge. In 2022 the Indigenous enrolment rate was 76.7 per cent. It now sits at 89 per cent. This is a huge feat, and one we should all be proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Special Minister of State, Don Farrell, for his support and the resourcing of the AEC. Senator Farrell certainly has had many a letter from me saying that we need to do more on Indigenous enrolment. I thank the senator for his dedication and his commitment. Once again I reinforce and thank all the staff of the Australian Electoral Commission, who have done a fantastic job going around the Northern Territory and into our remote communities and enrolling a lot of our people who have been isolated or disengaged from the voting system.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion moved by the member for Lingiari. There are elements that are obviously extremely political that I don't agree with or accept as criticism of the coalition, but I certainly support the principle of this motion, which is celebrating improvements in Indigenous enrolment. Beyond question, I think that's an excellent achievement, but a job not done. I'm certainly in support of ensuring that everyone who is entitled to participate in our democracy can participate in our democracy. It has absolutely been very regrettable and unacceptable that, for an extended period of time—probably always—the statistics around Indigenous enrolment have not met the population-wide levels. We want to have every Indigenous Australian participating in our democracy and we will address in any way we can ways to ensure that Indigenous enrolment is at least meeting the standards and statistics that are the case for the rest of the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly welcome that outcome, but it does provide an opportunity to address the second challenge, particularly in Northern Territory remote communities—and this has been highlighted in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters hearings I've participated in—of the intimidation of Indigenous voters. After the 2019 election we held our standard electoral matters inquiry into the election and received some very concerning evidence in that inquiry regarding the intimidation of Indigenous voters. The best encapsulation of this was evidence received from Mrs Bess Price, whose daughter now serves in the Senate here. In her contribution to the evidence she made a very important point. She said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2019 federal election I was up in Milingimbi, up north. There was a Labor man there staring people down. He came and eyeballed me and threatened me for talking to people and informing them of what their rights were. He was aggressive throughout the day, and he often had members of the community walk in with other elders of the community to show them how to vote and who to vote for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We managed to get a hold of AEC staff inside the building, and we told them: 'Keep an eye out for these fellows. They're the ones who are going in.' I've seen people going in with them and showing them how to vote, and using language—Yolngu matha was broadcasting on the radio throughout the day saying who to vote for in language. We were told that the unions had paid that radio station to broadcast in language who to vote for, and it was Labor.</span>

                  </a>  Well, that's actually evidence under parliamentary privilege. What an accusation to make! And it has been sitting there for four years, undisputed. No-one has rebutted that, and that was an eyewitness testimony from Mrs Bess Price to the Electoral Matters Committee in September 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, we've had other comment publicly in recent times regarding the intimidation of Indigenous voters around community consultation as well—around decisions in Alice Springs. Certainly, comment has been made about the way in which the process of community consultation is influenced and impacted through that sort of intimidation. I absolutely welcome improving and increasing Indigenous enrolment and, at the same time, also making sure that every element of Indigenous participation in our democracy is something that we respect and protect. Evidence of intimidation of voters anywhere, and particularly in Indigenous communities, is something that we need to look at closely and consider: who is doing this? How do we find the actors that are seeking to influence the democratic right of people to cast a secret ballot for the person they actually want to vote for, rather than being intimidated into voting for someone that they're told to vote for? That evidence is very regrettable, and the success in Indigenous enrolment presents us now with a good opportunity to also address this concerning evidence and the claims of the intimidation and influence of people seeking to participate our democracy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I am delighted to rise and speak on this motion put by my friend and colleague the member for Lingiari. We are lucky to live in a democracy where the right to vote is fundamental to our identity. But it's not just that Australia has compulsory voting; a strong democracy depends on all citizens being able to participate equally, no matter who you are or where you live. But we know that there are barriers to voting in this country that affect some Australians more than others. Historically, there are two particular cohorts who have been underrepresented on the electoral roll, and they are First Nations Australians and young people aged between 18 and 24 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a government that is determined to ensure we have a healthy democracy. A healthy democracy makes sure that all members of its community have equal access to the political process. I am pleased to stand here to acknowledge the dedicated work of the Australian Electoral Commission and some 80 community partners who are working with great success to help enrol and engage these underrepresented groups of voters. It is amazing just what can be achieved with some proper resourcing of the Australian Electoral Commission and some political goodwill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among people aged between 18 and 24 years, for the first time since records have existed, enrolment is now over 90 per cent. The AEC set out with a target of achieving an enrolment rate of 87 per cent among this cohort by June, and it has easily surpassed this goal. First Nations enrolment is now at the highest level that it has ever been. What an amazing thing to celebrate! This is in every state and territory. Over the last six months the rate has risen from 84.45 per cent to a record high of 94.1 per cent. That means 60,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have enrolled to vote since last year. Now there is just a difference of 3.4 per cent between the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate and the national enrolment rate—what an amazing achievement! In New South Wales, Indigenous enrolment has increased over the last six months from 91.3 per cent to 97.5 per cent, the second highest enrolment rate in the country. In the Northern Territory, which has historically held the lowest First Nations enrolment rates, there has been a monumental jump from 76.7 per cent in December to 87 per cent today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are successes that should be celebrated, but they have not just happened by chance. In the 2023-24 budget, the Albanese Labor government provided $16.1 million over two years to the AEC to increase First Nations enrolment and participation in future electoral events. The AEC has adopted new solutions and targeted approaches to achieve this goal. For example, direct enrolment is now easier for people who do not have a mail delivery service to their residence. It's a common issue in remote communities, where mail is delivered to a central point. Earlier this year, the Special Minister of State endorsed a regulatory change to introduce Medicare cards as an additional form of identity for enrolling, making it easier for people who don't have an Australian drivers licence or passport to prove who they are when they're enrolling. I am proud to be part of a government that prioritises the enfranchisement of its people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that with the last 10 years, where we had a Liberal government that ripped resources out of the Electoral Commission and tried to introduce policies that would negatively affect turnout and Indigenous participation. This included trying, and thankfully failing, to introduce a bill that would require photo ID on election day. This was a policy that would have disproportionately affected Indigenous Australians living in remote communities. As we head towards a referendum on the Voice to Parliament later this year, ensuring that First Nations Australians have input into Australia's democracy and a say in matters that impact their lives and community is especially important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the AEC commissioner, Tom Rogers:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The referendum will have the best base for democratic participation of any federal electoral event in Australia's history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something that every Australian should feel proud of. That is something that this government is especially proud of. I hope to see those voter numbers forever increase.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that under the current government, the Albanese government, decisions to conduct review after review into Defence and the defence industry have resulted in unreasonable delays in awarding contracts. These delays within the defence industry have led to uncertainty for small and medium enterprises in particular, threatening many of those SME businesses and forcing them to consider leaving the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the industry body saying about this? Brent Clark, the CEO of the Australian Industry Defence Network, says this in relation to delay after delay by the Albanese government in the defence industry: 'Apparently our strategic circumstances are so dire and so consequential that the Defence Strategic Review had to change the Australian industry involvement to simply being an achieved item as long as we do not hold up gaining capability. We will say that any opportunity we have, we will say that to any journalist we can and we will say that to Defence when we have to do. This is not a Defence issue. This has nothing to do with the Department of Defence. This has everything to do with our politicians. We do not believe that this government, the Albanese government, is treating small and medium enterprises in a fair and equitable manner.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say: 'The DSR has opened a can of worms that cannot be closed. The DSR, by virtue of saying that speed to capability trumps Australian industry involvement, means that at every turn the excuse of not using an Australian company will be viable. Why? Because you actually have to put effort, time and money into getting Australian companies qualified for supply chains. If I have a pre-qualified company from overseas, my speed to capability is faster. We are not having a go at any prime contractor in this; this is wholly and solely directed at the federal government'—the failure of the Albanese Labor government. We acknowledge the government's agreed recommendation from the DSR, stating that Australian industry content and domestic production should be balanced against timely capability acquisition, and that requires financial support. The issue is that there isn't financial support. There is absolutely no new money from the Albanese government in the forward estimates in the next four years—not one new dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members here could imagine if we were in government and we came in and said, 'No new money for education, no new money for health, no new money for the ABC' or whatever. Imagine how those opposite would react. Worse still: we've actually heard the defence minister in this place come in and say it's not how much money it is; it's how you use the money. Can you imagine if we said that about schools? What would those opposite say? They'd be hitting the roof. But, when it comes to Defence, the <span style="font-style:italic;">DSR</span> states that we have a short time frame, and, for those watching, there is not one new dollar from this government in the next four years. In fact, CASG is cutting billions of dollars out of Defence. They need to cut another $4.3 billion out of Defence to achieve their aim, and this is actively removing small and medium enterprises from the supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were at war, for example, the missiles for our frigates would be gone in 30 minutes. Then the ship has to sail back to shore. 'Where are the stockpiles?' We've got no stockpiles. What are the minimum stockpiles that this government has set in the last 18 months? They've ordered nothing when it comes to 155-millimetre munitions. We have enough munitions to last a week, all under the Albanese Labor government. With HIMARS missile capability delivered from the DSR—the only thing—they are first due to be delivered in 2026, and to date the project hasn't even been allocated a number for purchase. How many defence industry companies have the minister or the Minister for Defence Industry met with? There are very few. As I've moved about South Australia, Victoria and Queensland, there have been very few.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to rise to speak to this private member's motion. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss all the good work the Albanese government is doing in defence, contracting and procurement. At the same time, I am perplexed; the member of the Petrie's motion seems to have forgotten the last decade. The motion decries the fact that our government has initiated reviews into Defence and defence procurement. This ignores the fact that these reviews remain necessary due to the shameful mismanagement in this space by the government of which the member was part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the side of the House, we understand deeply the complexities of defending our country and the detail which underpins that important endeavour. We understand the vital importance of our defence industry not only for capability development, not only from the perspective of sovereign capabilities but also for growth and job creation. Indeed, I understand these issues well. It's no secret that I worked for many years for Professionals Australia, the union representing white-collar defence industry workers. I worked closely with Defence workers across the economy and at almost every level of the procurement and manufacturing process. I saw first-hand the atrophy and drift the previous government inflicted on the defence industry sector. The lack of action and the lack of direction left industry players at a loss and unable to make plans or see a future for themselves here. Our defence industry workforce found itself in a directionless state. I found this situation utterly frustrating and unacceptable, as did many of my colleagues. That's why we came into government with a commitment to fix our defence posture and our defence industry policy, and that's exactly what we have been doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget the absolute mess in defence industry and procurement that we inherited upon taking government last year. The ANAO told us in October last year that a series of projects are facing major delays and budget blowouts. The combined value of these projects comes to more than $69 billion. As defence expert John Blaxland put it today, defence procurement has been 'messy, expensive and inefficient'. What are some of these projects? One is the Hunter class frigate program, beset by major delays in the start of construction to the tune of four years, with a $15 billion blowout in costs, all hidden by those opposite when they were in government. Another is the C-27J Spartan battlefield airlifters. This capability was delivered four years late, and, despite their name, the C-27J Spartan battlefield airlifters cannot actually fly into a battlefield. Then we have the offshore patrol vessel project, a critical capability for our border security. This project is already one year behind schedule. Similarly, the evolved Cape class patrol boats are a year late, the new battlefield command system is three years behind schedule, and then there are defence satellite communications projects, which are running up to four years behind schedule. These projects are all critical to our security and enhanced defence capabilities. Their successful and timely completion are critical to the security of the country. A policy and culture of atrophy and drift from those opposite let these and other projects wither.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This drift not only jeopardised our security but robbed our domestic defence industry of the certainty needed to make contract and investment decisions. When the member for Petrie complains about the challenges facing Australia's defence industry and looks for someone to blame, I'd suggest he find a mirror. Indeed, he is part of a government that had six defence ministers in nine years. Their record on the question is one of abject failure. It is a failure that we are here to correct. The Albanese government is committed to ending the drift and atrophy in Defence and building and strengthening our domestic defence industry. We will enhance and strengthen our defence industry by giving it clarity and guidance. We'll give it clarity and guidance through our soon-to-be-released defence industry development strategy. Through this, we will grow our sovereign industrial base and provide more opportunities to our defence industry to participate in a meaningful way in big projects like AUKUS. We are getting on with fixing the mess left by those opposite. Stunts like this private member's motion just demonstrate that they have learnt nothing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I want to commend the member for Petrie for this important PMB today. It's no doubt that if we get a strong defence industry it plays a key role in our national security. The Albanese Labor government unfortunately have become obsessed with reviews, roundtables and discussions, and it's having a profound impact on all Australians. While Australians grapple with the rising costs of living, energy prices through the roof and some of the most uncertain times for our nation in terms of national security, the only action that this government has taken is to announce review after review. Importantly, this is having a devastating impact on Australia's defence industry, which has been left grappling with uncertainty created by those opposite. Anyone who has worked in business knows how important certainty is for businesses. It allows them to invest capital, to get their workforce structure right and to service loans. The Albanese government is not providing this certainty for industry. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> reported on 11 April this year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australian defence firms say they have been forced to delay investment and hiring decisions because the federal government is holding off making acquisition decisions …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With nothing but uncertainty from the people running this country, businesses can't invest in machinery, they can't invest in upskilling staff and they can't make plans to secure our ongoing national security. That's what this government is playing with. This is despite the government's agreed recommendation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence strategic review</span> warning of Australia's 'deteriorating strategic environment' and calling for an increase in defence funding to meet our strategic circumstances. That funding has not been forthcoming from this government. The review found that Australia's industry content and domestic production should be balanced against timely capability acquisitions, but this requires financial support from the government. Without financial support, we run the risk of losing more contracts overseas, which would negatively impact on our sovereign capability. We will lose the ability to make those things that are so crucial for our defence industries, our defence and our country. With pillar 2 of AUKUS having a focus on AI, quantum, hypersonics and cybersecurity, it is vital that we have a strong and robust defence industry to execute on these technologies and develop our sovereign capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just around this strategic review. Another great example of this government not being prepared to make the right decisions in our national security is not having a minister for the digital economy to make sure that these AI businesses, cyber businesses and cybersecurity can work in our defence industries but also in our domestic economy, building their strength. I had the opportunity last week at a Tech Council event to speak to quantum companies and to AI, and they were talking about the synergies and opportunities in defence industry and the commercial sector. This government is dropping the ball in both spaces, which impacts our national security. It's important that we support Australian businesses in the defence industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One great example of an innovative business is SYPAQ, which has developed low-cost drones under a $1.1 million Defence Innovation Hub contract from the previous coalition government. These are drones made of cardboard. They come flat packed and can launch—flying up to 120 kilometres—and land by themselves. These have been manufactured here in Australia—down in Melbourne, actually—and are now being sent to Ukraine to help the Ukrainian forces. This is just one example of Australian innovation and ingenuity creating jobs in Australia and securing the national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's disconnect with the Australian defence industry should alarm all Australians because it shows their complete lack of understanding of the challenges our nation is facing. It shows a lack of urgency around what is arguably one of the most important roles of a federal government: protecting our borders and keeping our nation safe. I urge the government: don't spend so much time looking in the rear-vision mirror and talking about the previous government. You're no longer in opposition; you're now in government. Now is the time to take action and make decisions. Stop talking about the past and actually take some ownership and deliver for the defence industries of Australia so we can have strong national security. Protect our dwindling defence budget, and advocate your Treasurer to increase that spending.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I obviously welcome this motion because it goes to unreasonable delays in awarding defence contracts, and I will reflect a bit on a decade of not much—I'll get to that. I welcome this motion because our government, the Albanese government, has been very busy for a bit over a year, fixing up the mess that the former government—the coalition; those opposite—left us when it came to defence industry. They talk a big game, as they're doing this morning, but they really failed to deliver. Our government is determined to provide the clarity and guidance that industry needs to make informed business decisions based on Australia's priority. Later this year our government will release a defence industry development strategy that will set out a plan to grow the industry's workforce to deliver a viable industrial base and increase Australia's defence export. There's nothing that makes me prouder than seeing Australians apply their trade and their significant know-how to make stuff that is the best in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to supporting the Australian defence industry so we can make more of the critical defence equipment that we need here in this country. We're also delivering the AUKUS submarine program with our partners, which is the most transformative industrial endeavour in our history. It will exceed the scale, complexity and economic significance of the creation of an Australian automobile-manufacturing sector, which those opposite wrecked, or of the construction of the Snowy scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program will create around 20,000 direct jobs over the next 30 years across industry, the ADF and the Australian Public Service: tradies of all sorts, operators, technicians, engineers, scientists, submariners, of course, and project managers—very important. At its peak, that AUKUS program will be building and sustaining nuclear powered and conventionally armed submarines in Australia and will create up to 8,500 direct jobs. That's just pillar 1 of AUKUS—the submarines. Of course, there'll be many more jobs and opportunities with pillar 2. Our decision to build infantry fighting vehicles in Australia will also support up to 600 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July, the government launched the Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator, less than three months after the government received the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence strategic review</span>. Our government is investing $748 million in these capabilities over the next four years and $3.4 billion, with a b, over the next decade. This is an additional $591 million above planned spending on defence innovation over the decade.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also focused on reforming Defence to make it a better customer for industry. Many defence projects are very complex and are at the cutting edge of technological, engineering and industrial capability, so they inevitably involve more risk. One problem—and there were many under the former government—was that defence ministers—and there were lots—failed to provide the leadership needed to effectively manage those risks. I can't recall, but I think the previous speaker said they had six ministers for defence over three terms of government under Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison. I actually think it was seven defence ministers, because you remember there was that bizarre time when there were Pyne and Paine and no-one really knew who was responsible for doing anything. As it turns out, no-one really was and nothing really got done, apart from requiring monthly reports on projects of concern or interest to the ministers for defence and defence industry.</span>

They were all red carpet and <span style="font-style:italic;">Top Gun</span> music, but, when it came to actually delivering defence capability, we knew they really weren't up to it.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Petrie for moving this motion. It is clear that he understands the importance of supporting our defence industry and, in turn, the preparedness and capability of our Defence Force. Our sovereign defence industry is an essential cog in the defence machine. Without the support of both small and medium enterprises on our home soil, our national security will be put at risk, and, with Labor's 2023-24 defence budget, that's exactly what they've done. The budget handed down in May clearly states:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This statement is then backed up by data which showcases a purposeful decline in local equipment and acquisition spend, followed by an increase in overseas spend. Why? Why are hard-earned taxpayer dollars of the Australian people not being invested back in the Australian businesses that support our Defence Force?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I thank the member for Petrie for moving a motion on defence industry and the capability of our sovereign defence industry. I also join with the member for Herbert in thanking all our defence personnel for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether he intended this or not, the member for Petrie's motion gives our side of the chamber ample opportunity to play a bit of compare and contrast as to how we get from point A, a plan and an announcement, all the way through to point B, the delivery. I say this because I feel it would be unfair, inaccurate and counterproductive to say that those opposite do not want to see Australia's defence spending and sovereign capability growing to suit our national interest in the broad sense. But we can look at a few key facts, like the Morrison government alone having three defence ministers in three years. That includes, at the tail end of the Morrison government, having their very own Leader of the Opposition himself on job. Seeing how he ran Home Affairs, frankly, makes us duty bound to examine things with a fine-tooth comb. It makes us want to look under the hood at what is actually going on within that space a little more intently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are instantly talking about billions of dollars with our defence industry, and it's only fair to review the delivery of a project beyond that point A—the announcement—against how things are faring in the approach to point B. The beginning of this examination occurred with the commissioning of this government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">strategic review</span>, co-authored by the Hon. Stephen Smith, a former defence minister who served in that role in both the Gillard and Rudd governments, and Sir Angus Houston, a man who needs little further explanation of his pedigree other than to point to his serving as Chief of the Defence Force until his retirement in 2011. But the handing down of the <span style="font-style:italic;">DSR</span> was only the starting point, and the member for Petrie's motion somewhat alludes to the reason why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For starters, there was the discovery that the Australian National Audit Office had identified major defence projects running years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, with 28 projects that are a total of 97 years behind schedule and 18 projects running over budget. At least $6.5 billion of variations from the initial approved budgets were identified. We saw battlefield airlifters that can't fly into battlefields. We saw patrol boats that were built with materials that are prone to rusting, which appears problematic even from a layperson's perspective. I may not have been in the navy, but from my days as a merchant seafarer I can tell you that this is quite an obvious flaw on most types of boats. Without listing the projects, we can understand why if one falls into any of those categories it might be described as a project of concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government understands that major defence projects are no small undertaking, requiring the hard work of personnel within the Department of Defence, the ADF and cutting-edge defence industry partners. This is by no means a simple task, but having a holistic view of our defence spend requires the government of the day, and ministers within the defence portfolio umbrella, to take an active role in monitoring projects to ensure this doesn't happen on a grand scale. It's easy to announce the spending of billions in defence as part of saying that defence spending has never been higher under a given government, but making sure that money has been spent wisely is just as critically important, albeit less flashy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands the importance of having a strong defence industry operating within its borders. As the member for Spence, I'm particularly proud of the defence industry that is operating within the borders of my own electorate. Perfectly located in the vicinity are the RAAF Base Edinburgh and the Defence Science and Technology Group, in a location that is enviously connected to the Osborne Naval Shipyard, which is going to play a major role in the AUKUS build. Everyone from the defence primes to SME manufacturers knows that the future is bright in this space, with primes such as BAE Systems Australia, Saab Australia, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics and Northrup Grumman operating in Spence, not to mention the building of Boeing's defence aircraft maintenance facility to support the P-8 Poseidon aircraft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have many fond memories of last year's Defence Industry Day held in my electorate of Spence. The Assistant Minister for Defence was kind enough to attend, give a keynote address and meet with members of the Edinburgh Industry Alliance on the day. I very much look forward to attending the next Defence Industry Day later this year. We've seen positive signs within the industry since the election of the Albanese Labor government and the handing down of the <span style="font-style:italic;">DSR</span>. Those in the industry that know me well will know I will always be fighting for the defence industry, as it's an industry that has kept manufacturing alive in the northern suburbs of Adelaide.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I rise in support of this motion that brought by the member for Petrie, who is the shadow defence industry minister. As a proud former government, when we were in government we as a team agreed to $210 billion worth of defence industry expenditure over 10 years. It's really interesting because, during the lead-up to the last election, when those opposite were in opposition, they said there was not a cigarette paper's difference between the then opposition and the then government. We now know that that is not correct, because those opposite say one thing when they're in opposition and do the exact opposite once they get the reins of power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anybody who is anybody in the defence industry world would know that the <span style="font-style:italic;">DSR</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">efence strategic review</span>, which was recently announced, had a very significant chilling effect on defence industry in this country. The shadow minister and I had the privilege of attending an AIDN—Australian Industry &amp; Defence Network—dinner just a couple of weeks ago. The speeches that came out of that night, at a Queensland level and also, earlier, a national level, showed absolute desperation among defence industry contractors. They are staring down the barrel of having to lay workers off because of the chilling effect that the <span style="font-style:italic;">DSR</span> has had on defence industry. Everybody has basically downed tools in the Australian defence industry because of this government's indecision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in government, we made 'sovereign capability' a catchcry. I didn't even know what it was until I came into parliament, but sovereign capability is incredibly important. I want to single out the efforts of people like Christopher Pyne, our previous defence industry minister, who really led the charge back then, and also the member for Durack and, of course, the current opposition leader. The coalition government has always believed in the importance of the protection of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">DSR</span> acknowledged that previous reports into Defence acknowledged that there is no longer a 10-year strategic lead time for a kinetic war that could potentially happen in the Pacific. It acknowledged that those were the findings of previous reports, and it accepted them. Notwithstanding that, do you think that this government put an additional cent into Defence? Not only did they not put an additional cent into Defence but they've cut a billion and a half dollars from the defence budget. That takes me back to my cigarette paper analogy. Those opposite, when we were in government, claimed that there would not be a cigarette paper's difference between them and us. Really they say one thing and they mean another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredibly important for this country, not only for jobs but for the protection and defence of this nation, that we continue down the route of sovereign capability. Of course, in this country we don't have the manufacturing base to be able to make fighter jets and things like that, but there are a lot of things that we can do in this country, and there are a lot of things that we can provide to the supply chain even of things like the F-35. Whilst we may not make fighter jets or helicopters, we're great at building ships. We need to have that emphasis on sovereign capability in this country because—may it please God that this never happens—if this country were ever blockaded or there were a kinetic war on, we could not rely upon our just-in-time supply chains, as COVID has taught us. We need to make stuff here. To make stuff here, we've got to have the intellectual ability and experience to actually manufacture right here in Australia things that we rely on in conflict.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Recently I visited the KU preschool in Castlecrag and spent time with Director Ainslie Quinn, Education and Quality Manager Kylie Anderson and the wonderful lilly pilly group of children. While the grown-ups discussed the importance of accessible and respectful early childhood learning facilities the kids literally wove in and out of our conversation, throwing questions and ideas to me. The incredible team there guides the learning of the children in their care through play based techniques, developing not just their social and emotional wellbeing but ultimately their life skills. Yet this is not easily done under current conditions. The director appealed to me to make the following case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to rethink the terminology used around this profession and ensure that people working in it are recognised for the role they play as educators. Those working in this sector deserve to be paid fairly and compensated for the hours they spend not just face to face but also preparing for school. Play based learning is about listening and gathering the children's ideas and presenting opportunities for these to be unpacked in a way that excites, engages and delights the child—be it learning to care and empathy through role-play in the family space, building skills to tie shoelaces or type on the computer, exploring mathematical concepts by sorting blocks, or learning about colours and textures when they gather leaves outside. It's about trying, failing and celebrating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to heed these words, it's clear that 600 hours is nowhere near enough to get this done. Early childhood educators are the voice of our children.</span>

To do this I believe open and honest communication plays an important role. In the last 15 months we have done many coffee catch-ups with lots of constituents. I was delighted when I got an invitation from Cafe Denada to host a community coffee catch-up at their shop in Mount Pleasant. This is why I want to share today the joy having participated in such a successful gathering with constituents has brought me. The positive atmosphere makes it so addictive to me.</span>

It was an opportunity to experience a sense of connection and build a stronger relationship with our community. I'm looking forward to going back to my electorate of Tangney and having the opportunity to do more coffee catch-ups and more community catch-ups with the people of Tangney.</span>

You have a duty to look after your fellow man. The figures that are available for abortions and that are rather interesting. Some 650 little children were murdered after they were born as a result of a failed abortion. You're allowed to kill them if you don't succeed the first time, before they're born. Then there's euthanasia. The daughter-in-law and some children might be there rooting and saying, 'Geez, daddy, just die because it's terrible the way you're living and, most importantly, I'll get your house when you die.' They have no respect for human life—no respect. It's a continuous pattern of behaviour.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Last week I provided to the Table Office a petition on behalf of some residents in my electorate. The undersigned residents were the U City residential village in Franklin Street. They requested that I table that particular petition. The petition reads that the government should make urgent representations with this particular position to the following federal ministers: the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Water, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy and the Minister for Resources. It talks about bringing some issues to the ministers' attention that the U City residents are passionate about. Those are related to climate change and their views on national policies that are required for action in a climate emergency as declared by, for example, the South Australian government. No. 1 is for the urgent adoption of the recommendations of the IEA and United Nations. No. 2 is to subject any planned offsetting of emissions of the most rigorous scientific examination by recognised national and international science groups, such as the IPCC. No. 3 asks that we stop referring to schemes as carbon capture and storage until recognised national and international science groups confirm the capability of those current schemes to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels cost effectively. They are a very passionate group. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight some strong results. In the senior boys division, multiple weight categories, Hassan Tabaja came second, Ben Pollak third, Ishan Ranthilaka and Vuk Isidorovic fourth and Daniel Georgiadis fifth. In the cadets division in multiple weight categories, Jake Bell came second and Adrian Georgiadis and Lewis Bell both came sixth. In the junior men division, multiple weight categories, Jake and Lewis Bell came sixth. In the Kyu grades divisions, which are below black belt level, Jake Bell came second and Lewis Bell came fourth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Today I rise to honour the life of a George Town community stalwart, Mr George O'Sign, who passed away last week aged 85. Born in Launceston, George grew up on a farm in Low Head and attended school in George Town before he undertook an apprenticeship, working for a few local builders and for Comalco before spending three decades at the George Town Council as a building inspector, building surveyor and health inspector. In fact, all around George Town, George has left his legacy across the area, with many buildings, including houses, having been built or inspected by him. His son Colin said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I used to take him in the car, and he'd say, 'I built that one' … just about every house in George Town they had a crack at when he was a builder.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After retiring in 2007, he was elected top of the poll in the 2009 local council election, the same year I was first elected to the council. I always found him to be very thoughtful and sincere and a great councillor who was very passionate about his local community. George eventually stepped away as a councillor following the death of his beloved wife, Pauline, after 54 years of marriage. He's survived by three sons, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, all of whom I know brought him so much joy. I particularly love the comment from Colin, who reflected on having George as his father:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He did everything for us and tried to give us more than he ever had. You couldn't ask for a more genuine man—he was a great family man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

The New South Wales South Coast has the most wonderful local volunteer organisations. Volunteers drive these organisations through their selfless contributions that support communities. From Kiama to Tuross Head, these grants have funded a huge range of resources, essential upgrades and training: funding for first aid training and life-saving equipment such as defibrillators; investment in training and resources; support for community engagement activities; and so much more.</span>

I managed to come in 10 seconds over the run time, so maybe next time. I'm now training for 2.4 kilometres in 16 minutes,.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I'm pleased today to have the law and politics students and teachers from Helena College in my electorate of Hasluck here to witness my commitment to voting 'yes' in the referendum to enshrine the Voice to Parliament in our Constitution this year, as one of many leaders of community organisations. It is incumbent upon us all to recognise and listen to our First Nations people and to provide them with a practical means to have a Voice to Parliament so we make laws that are in their interests and allow them to provide solutions as they see fit to their own problems.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have witnessed many community groups already coming forward to demonstrate their support for voting 'yes' for a Voice, and I want to reflect specifically on the religious community groups who have stepped up. The Voice is supported by the St Vincent de Paul Society, together with the Salvation Army, Anglicare Australia, BaptistCare Australia, Catholic Social Services Australia and UnitingCare Australia. In February, a statement in support was signed by leaders of Australian faith communities, including the Anglican Church, the Catholic Bishops Conference, the National Imams Council, the Sangha Association, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Hindu Council of Australia, the Council of Churches, the Sikh Council and the Uniting Church assembly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend these groups for their solidarity and I ask all of you in this room today, especially those who are young, who are going to need to explain on the Monday following what the yes is about. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I had some fruit with me last week in the House of Representatives. That speech was to try and make everyone understand what it takes to grow a piece of fruit—and the fact that it's healthy and it's very important for our community. But it takes government policy to assist with that, and I was critical of some of the policies of the Labor government. But what I've seen is an overwhelming response saying that young people don't understand where our food comes from, and that is a great tragedy.</span>

They're going to come together to help horticultural and agricultural teachers to promote where food comes from and what it takes to grow it, and to encourage young people to be involved in these industries. What could be more important than ensuring that all people in Australia have access to healthy, Australian, clean fruit and vegetables? It takes policy, it takes educating young people and it takes the sort of passion that Catherine has for growing, in her case, broccoli.</span>

The Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation in Bendigo—the Dja Dja Wurrung are the traditional owners of our area—are advocating yes to the Voice. 'Dja dja' actually means 'yes yes'.

Recently in my electorate of Flynn, near the small town of Bajool, a multi-vehicle crash occurred on the Bruce Highway. In the incident, three vehicles caught fire and another four were extensively damaged. They included a B-double truck and a semitrailer carrying a military tank. Six people were transported to the Rockhampton and Gladstone hospitals, three with suspected spinal injuries. Diversions were put in place for people travelling between Gladstone and Rockhampton, which added significant travel time for many residents. A truck driver was killed yesterday in an accident at Mount Larcom. Yet what have we seen from this Labor government regarding rural and regional roads? We have seen review after review. </span>

I call on this Labor government to finally show some respect for the people of Flynn and to not strip any further funding from our region.</span>

It was an opportunity to gather some of the wonderful artists in south-west Sydney and talk about what they'd like to see in an arts policy development. We spoke about the Albanese government's national cultural policy, Revive, and the benefits of finally having the certainty of a national plan for the arts. Other discussions centred around culturally sensitive spaces for creative arts and how the COVID closures are still affecting the ability of artists to earn a living and create. I am a strong advocate for our local artists.</span>

The current exhibition, Paradoxes of Paradise, by Creative Hybrids Lab, is showing, and I definitely recommend Bellbird Cafe. The food there is always fantastic, the chef is amazing and the produce is sourced from the garden on site.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  On Saturday evening the Far North Queensland Emergency Services Association held its annual Emergency Services Charity Gala Ball—an evening not just with glitz and glamour but for purpose and passion. The association was established following a heart-wrenching tragedy at Ravenshoe, in the Atherton Tablelands, back in 2015, when a vehicle unfortunately smashed into a cafe and people's lives were lost, and it has raised over a quarter of a million dollars in the years that have followed. This year, the ball's proceeds were directed towards the Fire Project, a commendable initiative dedicated to diverting our youth from a path of crime and guiding them to mentorship, leadership and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Far North Queensland Emergency Services Association president John-Byron Bacalakis, the committee and all of those who made this year's gala ball a reality. While I am disappointed I wasn't able to share the night with you, I am immensely proud of our community's continued resilience and generous spirit. Lastly, I'd like to commend the unwavering dedication of our local emergency services personnel. Your service to our community not just in times of dire emergency but in fostering community spirit and offering support to important causes is truly admirable.</span>

Judyth Watson OAM, who died last month. Jude served in the WA parliament for a decade, first as the member for Canning in 1986 and then representing the seat of Kenwick. She served in the Lawrence government as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Women's Interests.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Judyth Watson trained and served as a nurse and later undertook a PhD on the question of workers' compensation. She made an important contribution to new policy on occupational health and safety during the Hawke government. After politics, Jude continued to make a significant difference through her varied work and advocacy in the cause of social justice. She was a founding member of the Coalition for Asylum Seekers, Refugees and Detainees, CARAD, which does vital work to this day. She later served as secretary of the Refugee Council of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was always personally glad for Jude's friendship and encouragement. She was persistent, good humoured, big hearted and wise. In her first speech to the Western Australian parliament, she said:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  Last week was Rural Fire Service Week, and it was a great opportunity to say thank you to about 26,000 Australians who give their time as RFS volunteers. Over the weekend, brigades from South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales gathered on the Gold Coast, where they trained, competed and, quite frankly, showed us how good they actually are. The event on Saturday culminated in an award for the Regional Young Volunteer of the Year for South-East Queensland and for the State Volunteer of the Year. The recipient of both of those awards was a man by the name of Ben Naday, who has been the First Officer of Tallebudgera Valley Rural Fire Brigade for a number of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ben actually joined the Rural Fire Service back in 2009 when he was still at school, so he's spent well over a decade serving his community through the Tallebudgera brigade. I've known Ben for a number of years, and he volunteers not only with the Rural Fire Service but also with Volunteering Gold Coast. Like many volunteers, he contributes a lot. Many of our volunteers in our community contribute to more than one organisation. For the service that our volunteers give to our community and the fact that we don't thank them often enough and that we could not do without them, I'd like to publicly say today: thank you for your service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  It was such a wonderful privilege to recently attend the 60th anniversary celebration of the Eastern Lions Soccer Club held at the Mulgrave Country Club in my electorate of Chisholm. It's always a good day to talk about soccer in Australia, but today, of course, is a particularly exciting one. Go Matildas! Eastern Lions have always prided themselves on bringing people together. Sixty years is a truly remarkable achievement for a club anywhere but particularly for a soccer club that has been the product of a number of mergers over the years. This is a club with a really rich and remarkable history that has made many contributions to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Formerly known as Waverley City, the club has gone through a number of changes over the years: a merger took place in the late nineties with Old Scotch to form Old Scotch Waverley, and then, in 2003, the club took an exciting new direction and the Eastern Lions brand was implemented. Despite some challenges along the way, success has never been too far away for the Eastern Lions, including three championships between 2010 and 2020. Norm Willcocks, the vice president, summed it up best when addressing the faithful, saying: 'Egos are left at the door, and we're all servants of the Eastern Lions Soccer Club.' Congratulations on 60 wonderful years.</span>

More than 100 days have passed since this so-called independent 90-day review was announced. What worries me is that lives are actually at stake here. It's like the government and the department have gone on strike, because work is not starting on road projects that would actually save lives in my community. What worries me also is that these projects are only becoming more expensive. The longer we wait, the more delays we will have and the more expensive the projects will become, meaning that there will be less road work done and there will be fewer dangerous intersections actually fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this minister has hit the ground reviewing. After 15 months in office, there's not a single new project in Gippsland funded by the new government. I say to the minister: why are you punishing Gippslanders twice? They faced delays in these projects because the Andrews state government wouldn't stump up their 20 per cent to get the work started, and now they're being caught up in your so-called independent review, which is basically a razor gang review trying to cut funding from worthy projects throughout regional Australia. These projects are under threat and lives are being put at risk because this minister cannot do her day job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  This morning I attended a press conference organised by the Australian Hazara Advocacy Network and the Parliamentary Friends of the Hazara. The occasion served as a reminder of the issues people in Afghanistan and the Afghan diaspora have had to deal with since the fall of Kabul. As we approach 15 August, we are reminded that two years have lapsed since the fall of the previous government of Afghanistan into the hands of the Taliban, an illegitimate government that is no friend of democracy, human rights or global peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, during this period, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the gross violations of human rights by the Taliban have gotten worse. It has led to mass migration out of Afghanistan, particularly among the Australian mission's locally engaged employees, ethnic minorities like the Hazaras, journalists, women's rights activists and those supportive of the previous democratic regime. I am pleased with the unwavering support extended by the Albanese Labor government to the people of Afghanistan and remain steadfast in my commitment to continue advocating for their fundamental rights and safety.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I was recently invited to celebrate Ilinden day, or republic day, with members of the Macedonian Senior Citizens Group of Doncaster and Templestowe, which was held at the Veneto Club in Bulleen. Since 1988 this senior citizens group has been at the heart of our community in Menzies. It is a group that now has 160 members. For those who have not heard of Ilinden day, or day of St Ilija, it is a great Orthodox and Macedonian national holiday which is celebrated on 2 August. Today, it is interwoven with patriotic folklore and religious symbols. There was much dancing, which I did partake in, and I really enjoyed it. There are videos of the dancing. I also enjoyed the food and the speeches. None of these events happen without the hard work of people who work on committees, so I particularly want to thank the president, Anna Eminagov, her husband, Kosta, committee members Kathy Kalchevski, Christene Krashov, Roula Kirk, Sophie Talidis, Christene Siderov and Tina Belchovski. Key attendees were councillors Michelle Kleinert and Anna Chen. I was also happy to do an interview with Margarita Vasileva of SBS Macedonian radio. I want to thank everyone. In that room were people who are proud of their homeland but, more than that, they're proud of their new home, Australia.</span>

Tonight all eyes will be glued to the screen, watching these amazing athletes battle it out against Denmark, to, hopefully, be one step closer to winning the World Cup. What is just as awesome is that each of these female superstars wearing the green and gold is an inspiration for all young Australian women. Of course we all appreciate the exceptional talent, skills and determination of this legendary team, but the success of our Matildas also gives every young woman the right to dream big and every young girl the right to see herself on the world stage. That's why female sports infrastructure is a priority for the Albanese government.</span>

This infrastructure matters. It ensures that Australian women and girls can have every opportunity to succeed in sport and in life. As we cheer on the Matildas tonight we are also cheering on every young woman with a sporting dream. I'd like to take this opportunity to give a particular shout-out to our local Matildas star, Kyra Cooney-Cross, who grew up in Torquay in my electorate.

A structured curriculum trains youth in technical football and team building skills, and teaches positive values, including trust, respect, discipline and patience. Run almost entirely from donations and by volunteers, training sessions operate five days a week and cater for up to 80 kids per day. They're picked up in buses from set points, taken to training and provided with breakfast, all before school. Everyone is welcome, and attendees include refugee children from Iraq and the Congo. I had the pleasure of being invited by the group's vice president, Christine Harris, secretary, Kristy Swain, and coach, Phil McMullen, to see the kids in action at an early-morning session a couple of weeks ago. I have to say: these kids would give the Matildas a run for their money! This program offers so much more than sports. It's about respect, how to engage with the community and learning life skills, and this amazing organisation has never been more important than it is now. I'd like to thank everyone involved, from the dedicated volunteers to the coaching staff and generous supporters. Your efforts are very much appreciated and thank you.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, TrackSAFE is launching a new campaign focusing on regional rail safety. The 'Expect the Unexpected: Look out for Trains' campaign reminds us that trains can appear at any time—especially when we least expect them. Trains can't swerve nor stop suddenly, so level crossings need to be approached always with caution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Level crossings in the north and north-west of Tasmania are a specific area of safety concern. Sadly, there are still around 40 instances per year in Tasmania of drivers or pedestrians ignoring level-crossing lights and bells, putting themselves and others in danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union support—and I am very proud to be a supporter of them—around 250 people in Tasmania who work as train and bus drivers, cleaners, train controllers, track maintenance workers and administrators. The RTBU met earlier this year with the Premier and Minister for Transport to suggest ways to fix the minority Liberal government's failing public transport issues—and there are a lot. Here's hoping that they make some headway, because we know that Metro bus drivers are certainly leaving the sector in droves.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I want to thank a Labor minister and also to make a request. I do want to thank the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health, Emma McBride, for intervening when the mental health practitioner at Gundagai was going to be lost. I made an urgent request; she listened, and she acted, as a good minister should.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to make sure that that position lasts longer than the 12 months that it has been given. That position is so important. Phil Gosling is doing such a good job on the ground to help mental health outcomes at Gundagai, and if that position is not maintained beyond the middle of next year then, unfortunately, many of those people are only going to slip through the cracks.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not good enough for a town the size of Gundagai not to have a mental health practitioner on the ground doing that valuable work. So I implore the assistant minister to make this position permanent. We, as a coalition government, put it in place. We know—everybody in this chamber knows—how important mental health is. We must make sure that we do everything we can to prevent people from, as I say, falling through the cracks. So I urge the assistant minister and the government to make this position permanent, beyond the 12-month stay that they have given it, and to allow Mr Gosling and others to do the great work that they have been doing since the coalition put the position in place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I had the recent great pleasure to welcome students from Koshigaya, Japan, to parliament to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the Koshigaya-Campbelltown sister city agreement. We had over 25 students and their teachers in parliament, and it was a really great pleasure to talk to them, show them around and hear their comments about the Macarthur electorate, Campbelltown and our parliament, and their expectations of their visit to Australia. We had great discussions on their thoughts about Australia, about government in Australia, about Campbelltown and about parliament, as well as on their interest in Australian flora and fauna, because they'd just been on a visit to the zoo in Sydney the day before seeing me last Thursday.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sister city programs are beneficial to both nations. They broaden community understanding and appreciation for cultures and customs of other nations. Those certainly blossomed with the Koshigaya-Campbelltown sister city agreement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1989, the people of Koshigaya gifted Campbelltown Arts Centre a wonderful teahouse, which is now in the middle of our sculpture garden, and we, in turn, gave them gifts of some Australian birds. I look forward to seeing this special relationship blossom, and, in particular, I'm looking forward to the 40th anniversary of our arrangement next year. I look forward to seeing more students from Japan coming to Campbelltown and to our parliament, and vice-versa—seeing our students from Campbelltown visiting Japan. I thank the wonderful students and their teachers who help us remember— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  Australians need a social safety net that works for them, but, according to a group of residents in Vaucluse Gardens in Hobart, older Australians are increasingly being left behind by a safety net that is, quite frankly, not fit for purpose. Indeed, residents tell me how face-to-face services at Centrelink offices are diminishing, with the loss of a dedicated seniors counter forcing people to call or go online to access services. Moreover, Centrelink's phone systems are constantly overwhelmed by calls, with many reporting being stuck on hold for two, three or even four hours before being hung up on. Even if they get through, phone services often don't work well for older Australians, especially those with hearing loss. Add to this the fact that many senior struggle to access and use digital services and you can see why the drive away from face-to-face services is causing such anxiety.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's more, the increasing prevalence of scams has people wary of digital correspondence, and the aftermath of robodebt has people terrified of incurring debts. Putting the onus on vulnerable Australians to contact Centrelink in ways they aren't comfortable with is not only inconvenient; it's discriminatory. Constituents contact my office weekly to report difficulties with Centrelink. Yes, Services Australia staff do great work under difficult circumstances, but as a system it is, quite simply, not up to the job right now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I wish everyone had heard Ian Hamm speak at a forum I hosted in my electorate a week and a half ago in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. A Yorta Yorta man, Ian was taken from his family when he was just three weeks old. This highly eloquent speaker set out succinctly what he believes the upcoming referendum is about. He argues that the referendum, at its heart, is about two questions. First, should Aboriginal people be able to speak? Second, should we allow Aboriginal people to speak about the things that are directly about them? Ian says the voice is not about fixing the past but what we want this country to look like in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another speaker, the University of Melbourne's Professor Kristen Rundle, explained succinctly why the proposed constitutional amendment takes the form it does, giving parliament the responsibility for the details, with the Constitutional change setting out the scaffolding. Professor Rundle said that she was committed to the voice because it is what Indigenous people had asked for and she trusted the process that had led to the Uluru Statement From the Heart and the Voice proposal as one of the most democratic ever undertaken in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same function, Aunty Geraldine Atkinson, one of the founding co-chairs of the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria, said that a voice would lead to better outcomes on the ground for Aboriginal people as they would have a meaningful say on how funds would be spent and how programs would be run and operated. I thank those three speakers and all of the many dozens of people from the community who attended this very highly successful forum.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I have here correspondence from one my constituents, Dr Adrian Frick, a dentist in my electorate, the son of a cane farmer, to the Minister for Health and Aged Care. It's with regard to Mr Frick's survival of a massive heart attack on 8 March 2022. I seek leave to table this correspondence.</span>

                  </a>  This is outrageous. This is actually correspondence from a constituent thanking the workers at the Friendlies Society Private Hospital, including Dr Wittmer and Dr Conradie. To tell you how serious it is—this is someone with some health background—he experienced, in his own words, 'a cracker of a heart attack that was statistically unsurvivable'. He survived because the Bundaberg cardiology unit was available in Bundaberg, but they now can't get more cardiologists, because they don't have DWS in a regional area. The solution from the federal Public Service and the health minister—and we have corresponded many times—is apparently that Dr Wittmer, Dr Conradie and others should stop doing calls, stop working weekends and stop saving lives, because that will bring down the claim statistics for Medicare, which are measured to determine if there is DWS. We need this assistance. We need this system to continue. We need to continue cardiac services. They cannot secure additional cardiologists. I again seek leave to table this letter.</span>

A special whole-of-school assembly took place on Friday during New South Wales Education Week. Attendees included some of the school's oldest living alumni, the two Joans—Joan McGoldrick and Joan Stewart—both aged 93, who started kindergarten together in 1935, and 92-year-old Audrey Milne. Another special guest was the former Carrington school principal from 1991 to 1996—and my predecessor in this place, the former member for Newcastle—Sharon Grierson, who is, in fact, back in Parliament House this week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Carrington Public School opened on 16 September 1873 as Onebygamba Public School, which means mud crab place. It became Carrington Public School in 1889. In a traditionally working-class community adjacent to heavy industry and the working port of Newcastle, the school has always been the beating heart of Carrington's tightknit community, educating generations of Novocastrians. More than 20 per cent of students today are Aboriginal and 50 per cent come from low-socioeconomic families. Carrington Public School is providing quality public education to ensure all students get the best start in life. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is self-explanatory. It outlines in a very logical way the issues and the challenges facing our world-class and sustainable native hardwood timber industry in this nation, particularly in the state of Victoria. What the motion can't capture is the emotion, the anger, the frustration and the disbelief that lies at the heart of the decision to ban all harvesting of native hardwood timber in Victoria in what is a Dan-made disaster for the people of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate of Gippsland and those in the electorate of Monash have been deceived. This has been an incredible act of treachery by the Premier of Victoria, who lied to Victorians repeatedly in the lead-up to making this snap announcement. Proud Gippslanders have worked in the bush and have provided a world-class product. Multiple generations of people have toiled and helped to keep our community safe and generate the economic prosperity of my region. They have been lied to by a treacherous Premier, who told them and guaranteed that the industry would remain in place until 2030. Without any notice whatsoever, he brought forward his announcement to 1 January next year—giving less than six months notice to these proud Gippslanders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to phase out the native hardwood timber industry by 2030 was bad enough. It was based on political science, not on environmental science. At least there was time for the industry to work through some of the issues, particularly the issues around the access to fibre and log supply. This snap decision, with no consultation, showed no respect whatsoever for my community. It is devastating families today. People are losing their jobs today. People have lost their jobs already in places like the Latrobe Valley, Orbost and Heyfield.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What worries me the most is that this decision is based on ignorance. It's city-based Labor MPs bowing down to environmental extremism and absolutism. They're saying that we must never cut down a tree on public land in Victoria again. It is bizarre and it's dangerous. The alternative to sourcing our own native hardwood in a sustainable way is to import more timber from foreign countries that have lower environmental protocols. The other alternative in Victoria's case is to raid other states, get a log supply from somewhere else. That's happening already as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way. The practical environmentalists in my region have been working with government to try to find a way to meet their expectations while also understanding that the demand for hardwood timber is not going away. The better way is the balanced and sustainable approach that the industry was trying to achieve. We in Gippsland believe in the reserves, in the national parks and in protecting old-growth forests—we believe in that. We also believe that public land, which is effectively a mixed-species plantation, is a better alternative to monoculture plantations of hardwood, which is what the Greens will have us doing in the future. A mixed-species plantation harvested on a rotational basis of decades has more biodiversity outcomes. The regrowth and revegetation that has to occur by law provides a better environmental outcome in our communities than the monoculture plantations which the Greens seem to think will answer all of our problems when it comes to hardwood timber supply to the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time is against me today, but I must make this point: people die when they live next door to poorly managed forest. Country communities are destroyed when decisions are made with no consideration of the impact on their social and economic life. And my community doesn't want handouts and they don't want a transition package—it will never be enough to replace their jobs and their lifestyles, and being forced to move away from the towns they love.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we're debating this issue, which is ostensibly a state decision, in federal parliament is that it will have impacts on the cost of living, undermine our supply chains, reduce our sovereign capacity to make timber products and reduce community safety in times of bushfire, and the skills in that workforce will be gone and perhaps be on welfare on the federal government budget. So I urge the Prime Minister to take this issue to National Cabinet. I also urge the Prime Minister to consider a national information campaign so that people can actually understand how our world-class sustainable timber industry works in this country. It's worth fighting for.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I thank the member for Gippsland for providing me with the opportunity to speak about a very important industry in my electorate. I agree with the member: we have a world-class sustainable native hardwood industry in Australia that delivers social, economic, cultural and environmental benefits for regions and for the nation. I'm not going to comment on what mainland state governments do, but I can tell the member for Gippsland that in Tasmania both the minority Liberal government and the Labor opposition are fully supportive of forestry. And, federally, you won't find much, if any, difference in forestry policy between the opposition and the Labor government. We went to the election in May last year supporting sustainable forestry, with a focus on growing a lot more plantations and building up the value-added sector, just like those opposite, and we are standing by that commitment. The Albanese government supports sustainable forestry, including sustainable native forestry. The native forestry sector provides more than $320 million to the national economy, and provided a net carbon sink of 35.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2020-21.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forestry and conservation are not mutually exclusive; they can and should be allies. Tasmania's native forestry sector supplies vital hardwoods and specialty timbers. The sector is highly regulated and strictly managed, with every tree taken replaced and with safeguards in place to protect fauna and flora. The cowboys have been run out of town. It's a different story overseas, as the member for Gippsland has already noted. If protesters get their way and kill the Australian native forestry sector, thousands of jobs will be lost, regional communities will be decimated and the global environment will be worse off. Trees will still be cut down, they will just be getting cut down in places where the environmental protections that underpin the Australian industry do not exist. I've had the privilege to see timber-felling operations in Tasmania firsthand. It's serious stuff, with safety and environmental protection paramount, and a lot of money tied up in capital investment. Our Labor government supports the highly skilled jobs that forestry now attracts, including 6,000 direct and indirect jobs in Tasmania and more than 51,000 direct jobs nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One big difference between the former Liberal-National government and the Labor government is that we're getting on with the job—we're not just putting out press releases. When Tasmania Liberal senator Jonno Duniam was minister for forestry, he was responsible for the billion trees plantation program—400,000 hectares by 2030 was the goal. But by 2022, Senator Duniam had achieved just one per cent. If we stuck to Senator Dunam's timetable, we'd all be pushing up daisies and it would be well into the next century before the goal was achieved. I know he's only a young bloke, but the member for Gippsland, the member for Monash and I would be helping the trees grow by the time they were in the ground!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, the minority Liberal government is in strife because mainland sawmillers are securing contracts from a state-government-owned grower, Sustainable Timber Tasmania. Local sawmillers are getting outbid unfairly for the work. I make this point because managing forestry can be a difficult business, whether you're a Liberal or a Labor government. But I can assure the member for Gippsland that forestry has the full throated support of Tasmanian Labor and the Tasmanian Labor federal MPs and senators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some of the support the federal Labor government is providing to Australian forestry. We've released $300 million in forestry support initiatives, including $100 million for the Accelerate Adoption of Wood Processing Innovation Program, launched nationally from my electorate earlier this year, which seeks to encourage higher-value products, use more from available resources and boost supplies for construction and manufacturing. I'm proud to stand with my timber communities in supporting sustainable forestry in Tasmania.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I couldn't complain about that speech from the member for Lyons. I just wish he were a Victorian politician rather than a Tasmanian politician. Regional Australia, from our point of view, has been dealt a terrible blow by what's happened in Victoria, and I come from that place too. I have lived regional forestry agreements through the Hawke-Keating government and every government since, including the Howard government, when we spent political blood and millions of dollars to get those regional forest agreements up for the states. We achieved great things on behalf of our communities to give a long-term, sustainable future for people like those the member for Lyons has just talked about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the member for Gippsland for bringing this very important motion before the chair to say: have a look at what they've done in Victoria. I was at a rally while the member for Gippsland was away; I took his place at that rally to say that we as a federal parliament actually care what's going on. I didn't restrict that to Liberals and Nationals, I'd like to say to the member for Lyons, because I know there are members of the Labor Party who care as well. I strongly supported the CFMEU Forestry Division, who worked out of my office to save the paper industry when it was in my electorate. The CFMEU Forestry Division worked out of my office, a Liberal Party member's office, to gain what we did in those times. These were very important issues, because this industry was worth more than $1.42 billion to Victoria alone, and it affects thousands of jobs—not just the jobs on the line in the forest but jobs that go all the way out, right across our community, and I mean thousands of jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so true that people making decisions in Melbourne, for instance, in those Green seats, do not have any idea of not only what we went through before but how we argued for the sustainability of this industry and the fact that you can regrow these forests and that they are broadly beneficial to the management of the forests. As the member for Gippsland said, it is now dangerous to live around a forest that is not managed and doesn't have any cultural burning. So you may say, 'Right, we're saving our forests from these terrible loggers,' and then, in turn, you have wildfire go through, which just destroys the lot. It kills them, so the return of the forest after that takes quite a while.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a real kick in the guts for my small communities, and it's immoral for this reason. We are one of the wealthiest nations in the world, with the greatest opportunity for forest management and to lead the way internationally—as Tasmania is doing, as the member for Lyons pointed out. It's immoral because we are now going to import far more timber than we otherwise would to fulfil the needs that are here. The member for Gippsland talked about monoculture trees, particularly blue gums, that are said to replace. They may replace the fibre for the paper industry, but they will not replace the structural timber, because the make-up of the blue gum does not handle the length of timber you need before you have a knot to be able to give you structural strength without laminating. You have to laminate every bit of pith to get your outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So these are real issues that affect real people. I can only hope that a miracle comes, and the miracle would be that the Andrews government falls for some reason and a sensible government comes in and reverses this decision very quickly. I'm here to plead for real people who are making great contributions and doing real jobs in country Victoria. Most of them live in the seat of Gippsland. That wealth that came out of that for the broader general public was more than just some timber or a tree that you see on the back of a truck going past your house every now and again. These are very important issues, and we bring them to the attention of the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I'll start with a few fundamental observations. In Australia and across the globe we've destroyed too much natural habitat already, and in Australia and across the globe we practice deforestation on a scale that has caused enormous harm to biodiversity on our planet and has put our climate system dangerously out of whack. Some estimates put the extent of deforestation in Australia over the last 200 years at 50 per cent. In 2021, Australia was named in a report by WWF as the only developed country on the list of deforestation hot spots, and, of course, we hold the unwelcome distinction of being the world leader in mammal extinctions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis you may think that in a country like Australia, with all our resources and practical know-how, the status quo would at least be a cessation of further harm; unfortunately, you'd be badly wrong if you thought that. Through all our activities—not just through forestry practices but in agriculture, industry and urban expansion—we continue to clear habitat in a way that pushes our biodiversity closer to the brink and continues to tip the carbon scale in the wrong direction. That doesn't mean that no clearing can or will ever occur again. It doesn't mean there's no place for very carefully managed and limited harvesting of non-plantation timber. It does mean we can't kid ourselves about the enormous harm that's already occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion refers to a 'sustainable native hardwood timber industry'. It would have been more persuasive if it had acknowledged that the industry, for most its existence in this country, has been unsustainable and if it had acknowledged that the coalition government did nothing in particular to make it sustainable. The reality is that, after a long period in which the coalition government failed to show the stewardship required to arrest an entrenched trajectory of environmental decline, the Albanese government is making sure we can have a sustainable approach to a properly managed and renewable timber industry. If this is not done, the further harm to our environmental, social and economic wellbeing will be enormous and irreversible. Not only will there be the extinction of species, but entire ecosystems will be lost for ever—river systems and groundwater reserves pushed beyond recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government will not sit idle and watch that occur. We'll not follow the coalition's method and leave the hard work for someone else or peddle dishonesty for short-term political gain by telling workers and communities that everything is fine and we can all keep driving towards a fast-approaching cliff. Already, the sensible and necessary measures of this government include a $300 million package to accelerate wood processing innovations, support new plantation capacity, combat illegally logged imports and provide $10 million for the Forestry Workforce Training Program. That matches the approach taken in my home state of Western Australia, where native forest logging will cease by 2024 and transitional programs include an investment of $350 million to expand WA's softwood plantations, in addition to the $80 million Native Forest Transition Plan to support affected workers, businesses and local communities in the south-west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July I spent some time in the Great Western Woodlands, north-east of Mukinbudin in WA. Those woodlands represent the largest unfragmented temperate forest on our planet, with 16 million hectares across a range of woodland and scrubland habitats. That woodland contains more than 20 per cent of Australia's flowering plant species and 30 per cent of Australia's eucalypt species. In fact, the amount of floral diversity in those woodlands is comparable to the plant diversity in Canada, a country more than 60 times the size. But, of course, those woodlands are already massively reduced from their original scale because the WA Wheatbelt, which occupies 18 million hectares, was carved out of a good proportion of the incredible western woodlands when it was even greater than it is today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Timber is a renewable industry, and it's a renewable material. We should produce and use timber in careful and sustainable ways. It's welcome, but in Australia we've reached the point where 87 per cent of our timber comes from plantations; we should get closer to 100 per cent as quickly as we can. Where native forest harvesting can sustainably occur, it ought to be in relatively few and small areas. Serious impacts on wild native forests and habitat, through logging or other land clearing activities, have to cease in this country and on the planet as soon as we can; otherwise, what would we expect, other than what the science shows us? Further biodiversity loss, environmental collapse and widespread and severe impacts of climate change—that's what we will get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Gippsland is a very good fellow, and I reckon he would have been super frustrated over the last decade to have been part of a government that was utterly irresponsible in grasping some of the big challenges, especially when he represents a community that will be at the sharper end of some of those challenges. It is indisputable to say that climate change and environmental degradation, which are entrenched in this country, will affect rural and regional Australians more sharply than it will affect those who live in capital cities, more sharply than the people in my community. Correspondingly, the actions of a responsible government to rise up and meet those challenges will have the greatest benefits and opportunities for rural and regional Australians. The member for Gippsland and his colleagues, after 10 years of waste and neglect in government, can choose to change their tune and change their approach and be part of those solutions, or they can keep playing the silly games they've been playing for those 10 years.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  I thank the member for Gippsland for bringing on this motion in relation to the native timber industry. For the past 12 months, I've been compelled to call out the prioritisation of ideology over need and theory over reality by this government. I've shone light on the ideological decisions that have escalated both the costs of living and housing and energy crisis across communities in Australia .Today, I rise to ask the government to ensure that we don't continue washing over the reality of the needs of our country and our communities for the sake of metro based, ill-informed opinion that is often perpetuated by other countries, not from the experiences and practices of our own nation. Of course, I'm talking about the sustainable hardwood timber industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My very passionate colleague the member for Gippsland has fiercely represented his community and championed the sustainable practice that his local timber harvest has employed for many months now. I'd like to provide a perspective of my own electorate's hardworking industry for consideration. The North Coast forestry industry employs an estimated 3,800 people and contributes $184 million to the local economy. Local timber workers in my electorate of Cowper are fiercely proud of their ethical and sustainable practices—businesses like Hayden Timbers in Rollands Plains and logging contractors like Matt and Kristy Parker up in Dorrigo. I have visited logging sites in my electorate on many occasions and have seen firsthand the painstaking environmental practices they utilise every day. The true environmentalists in my state don't live in Sydney. They're not sitting in boardrooms deciding the green-aligned taglines that resonate with their marketing strategies. They're not strapping themselves to machinery attempting to gain more likes on Instagram. The true environmentalists in my state are out in rural and regional townships doing practical environmental work on a daily basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not in a logger's best interest to negatively impact their environment. How could it be? The creation and management of thriving forests is literally what keeps them employed. Why would they want to destroy it? Shutting down our native timber industry is not just detrimental to the local business owners and workers in regional electorates like mine; it is detrimental to the country's economy and, ironically, detrimental to the local and global environments that those opposite and on the crossbench consistently refer to. I should say that it was pleasing to hear in the speech by the member for Lyons that he supports the native forest industry. I hope that he goes and talks to his colleagues and explains how sustainable it is and how it should continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A sustainable native hardwood practice is not deforestation. It is not land clearing. It is not irreversible. Our local native timber harvesters are positively impacting emissions through the planting of native saplings. They are responsibly managing local forests and protecting them from pests and introduced species. They are contributing to biodiversity outcomes. Comparatively, plantation timber, which is our only other local option, provides none of this. It is planted in cleared land and is a monoculture. Whether pine or hardwood plantations, these are monocultures. They are not contributing to our biodiversity targets. We also don't have enough of them to sustain our own building and manufacturing industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Gippsland spoke about the unfortunate reality that the meticulous and heavily regulated native hardwood practices that we employ in Australia are not shared by other countries around the world. It's from those countries that we'll be forced to purchase timber, at a financial cost much higher than what we achieve locally, and it's those offshore forests that will be destroyed. I look forward to seeing these issues raised in the next National Cabinet and I hope to see facts about our critical, responsible native hardwood— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  In rising to speak to this motion, I do want to acknowledge the member for Gippsland and how steadfast he is on this issue. He has been an advocate around forestry for the time he has been in this parliament—possibly, before. I have to say that, in my experience, the only person I know who can match him for his fierce advocacy is Michael O'Connor from the CFMMEU Manufacturing Division, who, like the member for Gippsland, does not make a secret of his position on native timber and the forestry industry, in representing his members in the way that he does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the good news is that the Albanese government does support forestry timber and a sustainable forestry industry, as previous speakers on this side have mentioned. In my own electorate of Bendigo, we were successful in a previous round of grants that the minister for this area, Minister Murray Watt, announced, for a great local project, that I hope will seed future work. It is our First Nations Dja Dja Wurrung people's corporation that received a grant to establish a local program where they will work on harvesting local timber through cultural thinning, for two reasons: for better bushfire management in our state parks and forests, but also to contribute towards a sustainable timber industry, for their organisation to create jobs for their First Nations people. I'm not suggesting that this is in any way to replace what has been lost by changes in the Victorian landscape, but it's a demonstration that, when we work with First Nations communities, where appropriate, where we can have cultural thinning or cultural harvesting, we can achieve a win-win all around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to our native forests and our native timber industry, there's a lot of work and a lot of lessons that we can learn from First Nations people. It's not as simple as some greenies would suggest—'Just lock it up and walk away.' That doesn't restore country—particularly in an area like mine, where we lost so much of our forest to the gold rush. What we have seen in my area, with a lot of our state parks, is the toothpick effect, where we have too many ironbarks trying to compete, and our First Nations community are quite right in saying: 'We have to thin; we actually have to take out a huge chunk of the trees that are there, because there is too much competition.' It's also not restoring the land to the way it was, and that's what the ultimate goal is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other efforts that we are taking as a government. Our forestry industry, as we know, generates 51,000 jobs directly, and forest and timber wood products generated $26.6 billion in 2021-22. In 2020-21, the Australian softwood and hardwood plantation estates produced 87 per cent by volume of the logs harvested, and the remaining 13 per cent were native forest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is delivering on what the Morrison government failed to do. I do want to make this point. I can remember the big, grand speeches about a billion trees to be planted and new plantations by 2030. That was what the promise was, and that was what would help get us through our timber crisis. But only one per cent of those have actually been planted. The previous government needs to take responsibility for some of the crisis that we're in. They didn't work with First Nations people to be able to be the advocates of where it is appropriate and necessary for there to be cultural thinning, as in the example I used earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is working to deliver for the forestry industry in Australia. This includes $300 million in measures to support the forest industry sector. I raised one of the examples of how they're delivering in that space in my electorate, but this is a complicated policy area, because it isn't just federal government responsibility. There is the crossover with states and territories. It is a space where there is a lot of interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my closing remarks I say we should listen to First Nations people on native forests, particularly on the issue of cultural thinning. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  Last Sunday I had the pleasure of joining Wentworth locals in Christison Park, a beautiful stretch of land that's perched on top of the cliffs and provides amazing views of the ocean and Sydney Harbour. I was there alongside colleagues from Woollahra council to celebrate National Tree Day and join members of our community as part of Australia's largest tree-planting and nature-care event. I was in the park, planting trees, tending to grasses and talking to Wentworth locals about the importance of conserving our natural environment combating the climate crisis. In that hour or two elsewhere across Australia, the staggering truth is that 52 hectares of unique and threatened species habitat were bulldozed—an area equivalent to 28 times the Sydney Opera House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has the highest rate of deforestation in the developed world and, every year, we log about two per cent of our native forests. The consequences of this destruction are enormous: we are the mammal extinction capital of the world and, if we continue at our current rate, we will lose national treasures like the koala and greater glider forever. In southern New South Wales there are over 250 threatened species that have been affected by native logging in the last two decades, and most of this logging is to make low-value products like woodchip and paper pulp, which we could get from plantations instead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the damage to our environment, the logging of native forests is also making the climate crisis worse. Our native forests are an incredibly powerful carbon sink. For centuries they have taken carbon dioxide out of the air we breathe, stored it safely under the ground and used it to generate new life. When we cut them down and we burn what's left to help clear the land faster, forestry experts estimate that this generates emissions of up to 15 megatonnes each year. If we stopped logging native forests in southern NSW, it would be by far the largest carbon abatement project in the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst native forest logging is destroying our environment and accelerating the current crisis, it's also costing us money. In the past two years alone, the New South Wales state Forestry Corporation has lost nearly $30 million in taxpayers' money. In the last financial year, VicForests lost $54 million. In a cost-of-living crisis, where every dollar matters, this isn't how we should be spending people's hard-earned money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that we have an opportunity to turn things around. We can protect our environment in ways that benefit our economy and provide new, high-paying jobs for people who currently work in native forest logging. This is a significant issue; I care very much about the livelihood of people who currently work in forestry, and I want to make sure that we find a way to support them through a change that is good for our environment and good for the economy. It needs to be good for those communities too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In NSW, transitioning to active forest management, sequestering carbon and sustainable tourism are estimated to have a net benefit of nearly $50 million, with plantations taking up the slack for making timber products. This transition must be carefully managed, and in New South Wales that means supporting the roughly 600 workers who are currently employed in native logging activities. We all want the best for our workers and our wildlife, so real support means a proper plan for transition. It doesn't mean creating a culture war that pits people in the cities against people in regional and rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ending native forest logging would be good for our environment, good for our climate and good for our economy. I welcome the commitment the minister made to me in question time a few months ago that she would bring native forest logging under tough environmental laws, but I urge her to go further, to follow in the footsteps of her colleagues in Victoria and Western Australia to develop a national transition plan and to end native forest logging across Australia for good.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  I begin by acknowledging the member for Gippsland, opposite, and noting his fierce advocacy for forestry—particularly native forestry—over a very long period of time in this place, which I respect immensely. In doing so I also make note of the member for Lyons, who spoke a little earlier on this same topic. Between them we have two fierce advocates for a sustainable forest industry here in this country from different sides of the parliament. That speaks of the importance of this industry to those of us here. The very great Bob Gordon—those that know him know—tells me that I might be the first forester in the House of Representatives, and I wear that particular mantle with a great deal of humility because, firstly, it's a long time since I donned a hard hat and, secondly, most of my work in the forest sector has been in the policy space. I'm acutely aware that when I hit the bush I need to be respectful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government recognises and values the important contribution the forest industry makes to Australia, particularly in regional areas. We understand that there are families, communities and regional economies that rely on forestry. In my home state of Victoria alone, the forest industry generates nearly 15,000 jobs, almost half of which are in wood product manufacturing. Across the country, nearly 51,000 Australians rely on the forest industry for work. That's why the Albanese Labor government is investing in forestry to support manufacturing, skills, innovation and a sustainable future for the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the former coalition government failed our forestry sector. Despite coming up with a grand plan for 400,000 hectares of new plantations and a billion trees by 2030, it only reached one per cent of this target before being tossed out by the Australian people last year. This failure to meet the growth need of the industry increased our reliance on imported products. These imports not only come from countries with questionable environmental and workforce standards but they can also undermine the potential of our domestic forest industry. Despite the significant challenge left by the coalition, the Albanese Labor government is wasting no time in delivering the support and investment that our forestry sector needs. The October budget included $300 million in new measures and we're expanding the plantation estate, modernising our manufacturing processes and giving workers the skills they need in a modern, sustainable forestry industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April this year, 34 wood processors from right across Australia were awarded over $100 million to support them in all of their activities. In addition, the Support Plantation Establishment program will see $73.8 million invested in the establishment of up to 36,000 hectares of new plantations.</span>

                  </a>  In addition to the Support Plantation Establishment program, we'll see $73.8 million invested in the establishment of up to 36,000 hectares of new plantations. These will be delivered in partnership with private industry, First Nations businesses, farm foresters and state and territory government forestry bodies. The Albanese Labor government is also partnering with the University of Tasmania to establish Australian Forest and Wood Innovation, a national research and development institute, and will deliver $100 million over the first four years of its operation. Importantly, we're also investing $10 million in the Forestry Workforce Training Program, $4.4 million to combat illegally logged imports and $8.6 million to extend the regional forest hubs until 2027.</span>

We know that the forest and wood product industries generate tens of billions of dollars each year, and we also understand that, when responsibly managed, forestry can contribute to the responsible management of our natural environment. In particular, forestry can reduce our net carbon emissions through sequestration.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government are delivering on our promise to roll out 58 urgent care centres across Australia. It's true that seeing a GP isn't easy. Too often, people are left waiting, or they're unable to pay. It has never been harder to get an appointment or more expensive at the back end of it. The Albanese government is dealing with workforce shortages to address the root cause in a system that was left to languish over the Liberals' wasted decade defined by missed opportunities and degradation of our primary health care system because they weren't governing for all Australians; they were too busy governing for themselves. They've got no understanding of the people in my electorate of Hawke, and many others like it, and they don't care to know. Instead of investing in things that actually mattered to communities like mine, like our primary health care system, Medicare, child care, TAFE and so much more, they abandoned us when we needed a good government to step up and get things done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community won't forget how they were treated by those opposite. It doesn't take long to find examples—like robodebt, recently re-litigated through the royal commission, unveiling the scale and size of the disdain they hold for our communities. In Melton alone, the centre of my electorate, 3,598 people were victimised by this illegitimate and illegal debt-recovery robodebt program. That's more than 3,500 people in one part of my electorate who through no fault of their own were ruthlessly pursued by those opposite for debts they had not incurred. It was wrong and it can never happen again. That's just one example of the way that my community has been treated by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have been given the task of helping Australia to recover. The Albanese government haven't wasted a day when it comes to our record on fixing the mistakes of those opposite. During the election campaign, we said we'd invest in our primary health care system. We said it was a priority. Our GPs and health workforce do amazing work across our communities. They're on the front lines and they're always there when we need them most. But it's no secret that our primary health system needs targeted and sustained investment to break the bottlenecks that are causing delays to care. I've heard from locals all across my electorate that we need a solution for when you don't need the lights and sirens but waiting for a GP appointment just isn't an option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After almost 10 years of cuts and neglect by the former government, primary care is in the worst shape it has been in for 40 years—the worst shape it has been in in the history of Medicare. Bulk-billing rates have steadily declined, and only 14 per cent of medical graduates work in general practice, down from 50 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivering an urgent care centre for Sunbury was one of my top priorities as a candidate running for election, and I've worked really closely with Minister Butler as well as the state member for Sunbury, Josh Bull, to get this over the line. It opened up at the end of June and it's already making a huge difference for locals, with fully bulk-billed services and no need for an appointment, and with all services being provided by highly trained and qualified doctors and nurses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're doing what we said we'd do. We're rolling out 58 Medicare urgent care centres all across Australia, and we're kicking in almost $500 million to get this done. My Victorian colleagues are also seeing the benefits of this rollout in their electorates right across our state, whether it's in Ballarat, Dunkley, Corio, Jagajaga, Bruce, Macnamara, Lalor or Nicholls. Many members in this place, just like me, are now seeing the direct benefits flow on to their electorates and their communities because we have gotten on with the job of rolling out these important centres.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard loud and clear from those in my electorate that this is already making a big difference. We've had 360 visits in the short period that the urgent care centre has been open. Whether it's for sprains, broken bones, cuts, wounds, insect bites, minor ear and eye problems, or minor burns they're putting in the work to deliver top-quality care for our community in Sunbury and, indeed, across Hawke. It's saving us time waiting in hospital emergency departments and in doing so it's taking pressure off those hospital emergency departments so that we don't end up with a tertiary healthcare system that is clogged with minor ailments at the emergency end of it. We're strengthening Medicare, we're making it easier for families to access quality care close to home and we're meeting the needs of the community in a time frame that is realistic and that ultimately ensures that we have the best possible health care for those who need it most.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  The member for Hawke claims that the Labor government is strengthening Medicare with urgent care clinics across Australia; however, there are a few things he failed to mention. The urgent care clinics promised for Rockhampton and Bundaberg remain undelivered, as the Labor government fails to meet the delivery deadline. Labor promised all 50 urgent care clinics announced during the election would be up and running by 1 July 2023, but only a handful have been established by the Labor Albanese government. It has come to my attention that these clinics have been established as a result of the Labor government simply taking over existing clinics, which fails to deliver one more doctor and one more consult for patients. Experts on the ground are even advising that the clinics will not take the pressure off of Australia's health system as promised. The government's failure to establish and deliver the original 50 clinics within their own time frame is a blatant broken promise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this Labor government came to power it has become more difficult to get access to a GP. Our healthcare system is under serious pressure and now they have broken their promise on delivering urgent care clinics in Rockhampton and Bundaberg to relieve the local hospitals. A local doctor in my electorate has told me that he has 5,000 patients on his books. Labor promised local residents that they would establish this additional health service, yet their failure to meet the deadline proves that they cannot be trusted to deliver real and urgent outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government continues to prove that Labor only prioritises health during election campaigns and it fails when it comes to delivering the services that the people of the Flynn electorate need. For instance, in the election campaign Labor ran the platform policy of: 'Child care. Medicare. Aged care. Labor cares.' Here are the facts. Child care is in crisis, Medicare is in crisis, aged care is in crisis and the Labor government is in crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at their record since they took office in May last year. Kindergartens in Biloela and Mount Morgan have been forced to close. GPs across the Flynn electorate are leaving the region and closing their clinics. An aged-care facility in Mount Morgan has announced that it will close. Labor also promised that every urgent care clinic would be open during the extended times of 8 am to 10 pm as a key part of their operation, but it was revealed in budget estimates that this won't even be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government was elected on a platform of strengthening Medicare and all we've seen so far is our Medicare system weaken. We've seen 70 telehealth services cut from Medicare. We've seen mental health service rebates slashed in half. Right around the country we're seeing the ramping at our hospitals getting worse and worse. Labor promised that they would make it easier and cheaper to see a doctor, but the Labor government has ripped doctors out of rural and regional Australia by changing the distribution priority areas. Without an urgent and comprehensive workforce strategy to address the workforce crisis it will not be easier to see a GP, no matter how many headline promises they make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all their rhetoric on prioritising health and aged care leading to the election, this Labor government continues to ignore the biggest issue facing both systems, which is workforce shortages. By refusing to develop a strategy to address this urgent issue our healthcare and aged-care systems remain under serious pressure. Labor's promises have delivered only headlines with no practical outcomes. Australians must look to this government's actions and not its words. It is harming our aged-care system by fast-tracking undeliverable requirements, it has removed critical support from Australians struggling with their mental health and it has redirected desperately needed doctors away from rural and regional towns in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities in my electorate of Flynn in the Rockhampton and Bundaberg regions are desperately awaiting an urgent care clinic that was supposed to be up and delivered months ago. However, it is becoming more and more evident that this Labor government has sold the Australian public a lie, and it's the people of my electorate who are suffering the outcome.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  Labor is the party of Medicare, which will celebrate its 40th birthday in February next year. This has been proven time and time again, perhaps never so emphatically as by this government this year, with policies and budget provision to support Medicare, as Minister Butler has said, into the 21st century. We have seen significantly cheaper medicines at a time when cost of living is an issue, a tripling of the bulk-billing incentive in the May budget for those most in need, extension of public dental services, more after-hours primary care, expansion of general practice and scope, a boost for mental health services and real support for health workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Medicare urgent care clinics are an excellent way to address pressures in the health system. There will be 58 of these delivered around the country during this term of government. I will focus my remarks on the clinics being rolled out in Western Australia. The areas earmarked by the health minister for Medicare urgent care clinics in WA are inner Perth, Rockingham, Joondalup, Midland, Murdoch and the regional locations of Bunbury and Broome. The Perth urgent care clinic at Morley and the Rockingham clinic are now operating, and the Joondalup clinic at Clarkson has been nominated and will be open soon. Midland lies in the centre of my electorate of Hasluck, and I'm keen to see the establishment of the Medicare urgent care clinic there. The urgent care clinics will not only enable local residents to attend for urgent care across extended hours without having to worry about the cost of treatment but also mean that pressure is taken off hospital emergency departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Joondalup urgent care clinic was announced it was welcomed by the Joondalup Health Campus, where there are about 100,000 presentations to the emergency department every year. A spokesperson for the hospital there said: 'A number of these patients are lower acuity presentations requiring urgent care rather than emergency care.' Many of us have had the experience of presenting to the ED during a busy period and having to wait for hours for treatment. The urgent care clinics will reduce the need to go to hospitals and make the jobs of the nurses, doctors and support staff at emergency departments easier too. Once established, some of the pressure will be taken off the EDs at hospitals close to each of the urgent care clinics, including the Fiona Stanley and St John of God hospitals in Murdoch, Broome Hospital, Rockingham General Hospital and Royal Perth Hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that this will also be appreciated by the staff at the St John of God hospital at Midland, once the urgent care clinic is established there, for this hospital emergency department currently caters for over 6,000 presentations every month. It is a relatively new hospital, and it has a fabulous reputation amongst my community and the health profession. Any way that we can support the work of those doctors, nurses and associated health workers and support staff will enable them to continue to provide quality care into the future. The Midland urgent care clinic will service not only Midland but also Kalamunda, Guildford, the Swan Valley and the hills communities around Mundaring and beyond into the wheatbelt towns as well as the growing northern corridor centred around Ellenbrook. I have actually already made a representation to Minister Butler for a further urgent care clinic to be located in Ellenbrook, hopefully in the near future, as the northern corridor of Perth is one of the fastest growing populations not just in WA but across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition should have matched this promise and they should now be lauding it, but instead they continue to focus on their negativity. The member for Moore is currently moaning on his website about the Joondalup clinic not yet being operational. Will he then congratulate and praise the government and its policy when it starts operation in the coming weeks? There's no point whingeing about a clinic or service that your party had no intention of providing in the first place. The government went to the election promising 50 clinics and expects to deliver 58 by the end of this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Paul Keating said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The underlying principle of Medicare was the health of any one of us should be important to all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it interesting that there is a whole generation of adults who've grown up never knowing life without the Medicare system, and I hope they treasure and value Medicare as much as my cohort and those older who might remember a time when the cost of medical treatment could be a significant obstacle to seeking it in a timely fashion. I look forward to hosting the minister for health in Hasluck and seeing the opening of the Medicare urgent care clinic in Midland in the coming months.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  Today I rise to speak on the member for Hawke's motion relating to Medicare urgent care clinics. I find the level of self-congratulation quite extraordinary in relation to this motion and other motions in the health space put forward by Labor government members. Towards the end of the 2022 election campaign, the now Minister for Indigenous Australians made her way into my electorate of Lindsay and made an announcement at Nepean Hospital with the Labor candidate, saying that, if the Labor Party won office, Lindsay would have its own Medicare urgent care clinic. We are more than a year beyond the commitment, and yet there is no clinic open for residents from Emu Plains to Colyton and Londonderry to Luddenham. Right across my electorate of Lindsay, we do not have this urgent care clinic. Rather, we have seen this Labor government commit to a time line which has already been broken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were told the urgent care clinics would be operational in the first year of the Albanese government. In fact, the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher, when probed by the shadow health minister, Senator Ruston, in Senate estimates told the committee that in November last year they were still working towards the 12-month deadline. Further down the track, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the member for Hindmarsh, told Australians, on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>, that 50 clinics would be up and running by the end of the last financial year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some urgent care clinics have opened in Victoria. The state government's priority primary care clinics were taken over by the Albanese government and rebadged as a Medicare urgent care clinic. The minister, today, in a media release, said Westmead, which is in Western Sydney, was getting a Medicare urgent care clinic, but the clinic is actually in Wentworthville and not at the Westmead health education and innovation precinct, which would have been an ideal location. Of course, the clinic is being delivered in the Labor member for Parramatta's electorate more quickly than other areas of Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community was promised this commitment. We know from the New South Wales Bureau of Health Information statistics that the emergency department at Nepean Hospital is struggling and needs support. This motion says that 58 clinics will take pressure off emergency departments. Well, Lindsay is waiting, and we're sick and tired of excuses from the Labor government on its commitments to our community. The Nepean Blue Mountains Primary Health Network's website has been updated very recently to say that Lindsay would have an urgent care clinic in Penrith. Well, it's actually going to be located in Jamisontown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the GP service for their assistance in running the service. However, I am disappointed that the Labor government misled our community that the Medicare urgent care clinic would be co-located at Nepean Hospital. A co-location at the growing health precinct surrounding Nepean Hospital would have been fantastic, and this is a missed opportunity. Not only that, but the Minister for Indigenous Australians stood out the front of Nepean Hospital with the Labor candidate to get votes during the election campaign. Local families thinking about taking their kids to the clinic will think twice about whether to drive to Jamisontown or to drive straight to Nepean Hospital in Kingswood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another note, the GP shortage is impacting Lindsay, and community members are rightly asking how the urgent care clinic will impact access to GPs when they're working at the clinic. The Minister for Health and Aged Care recently changed regional arrangements for GP classifications to be closer to cities, noting the help that outer urban areas need with health workforce shortages. The minister is still refusing to answer questions around the staffing of the urgent care clinics, and, due to this and other issues, the Department of Health and Aged Care noted in a recent budget estimates hearing that in many cases the clinics will not be able to provide the extended opening hours of care that the Labor government committed to at the 2022 election. I'd like to know the opening hours of the Lindsay clinic because my community doesn't know yet. Will they be short hours, or will they be the hours that were promised by the Labor government? Again, this just seems like another broken promise.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  I'm proud today to be speaking on another commitment that the Albanese Labor government is delivering, and that is to establish the 56 Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia, with a total investment of $493.5 million over five years. It's a bit much to hear members on the other side criticising this particular policy, especially when you have a look at their record in government for 10 years, where we saw bulk-billing decline continuously. The public, hospitals and doctors were screaming out about bulk-billing, and they sat there and did nothing. So it's a bit much listening to those on the other side criticising something that will add to our primary health care and is really needed. Primary care is in the worst shape it has been in for 40 years, with no action from the previous government in the last 10 years. What we saw under the previous government was 10 years of continuous cuts and neglect. As I said, bulk-billing rates were in decline, and only 14 per cent of medical graduates now go into general practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare urgent care clinics are just one way that this government is trying to help in strengthening Medicare and making it easier for Australians to receive the care that they need and deserve when they need it. All of these clinics will be bulk-billed and will be open seven days a week for extended hours. This means that more families will get top-quality care from a nurse or a doctor without having to wait in a hospital emergency department. We see the waiting lists around the country in hospital emergency departments, and that is because people can't afford the gap that they have to pay when they go to a doctor, so they front up to an emergency department, or they can't get in to see a doctor because we don't have enough of them. This will ease the pressure a bit and take those people who aren't real emergency cases to these urgent clinics. This also means that, through the establishment of these clinics, we'll see a little bit of easing of the pressure on our hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently 16 urgent care clinics open nationally, with more opening in the coming few weeks and months. I'm very proud to say that in South Australia—my home state and yours, Deputy Speaker Sharkie—we're thrilled to be receiving five Medicare urgent care clinics around different areas, and one is proposed in the city of Adelaide in my electorate. It will service the inner suburbs surrounding the CBD, and it'll take a great big burden off GPs and the emergency department. Primary Health Networks across the country are working hard to finalise the commissioning process for the urgent care clinics, while also ensuring that they are integrated—it's very important that they be integrated—with local hospital and health systems and meet the needs of the local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that hospitals and emergency departments across the country are under pressure. I don't think there's a single hospital in any major city that isn't under pressure. Since coming to government, we've made it a priority and a commitment to strengthen Medicare and reduce the pressure on our hospitals so they can provide the quality care that Australians deserve, and this is one way of easing that pressure. These Medicare urgent care clinics will save thousands of stressful, expensive and ultimately unnecessary trips to hospitals and emergency departments. You can't blame people for going to the emergency department given the state that our health system is in at the moment. When you've got a bad flu and a temperature and you can't get in to see a doctor because the waiting times could be two or three weeks and you need that care there and then, or when you can't afford the gap—many people just cannot afford the gap—the next choice is turning up to the emergency department. So freeing it up and reducing pressure will allow the emergency departments in our hospitals to focus on higher-urgency and life-threatening conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Again, I'll speak about the 10 years of cuts and neglect of Medicare by the former government. It has never been harder to see a doctor, and when you do you're often paying a gap fee that is higher than ever before in the Medicare era. It's not without any noise. For years previously, as I said, doctors, hospitals and health professionals were all screaming about— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  The member for Hawke asked this chamber to recognise that the government continues to strengthen Medicare through delivering the planned 58 Medicare urgent care clinics. I suggest to him that he's a little premature in seeking this recognition, since the government has only delivered 16 clinics. I also suggest to this chamber that we return to this motion after the government has actually delivered the 58 clinics they've promised. Again I ask, as I so often do in this House: what about regional, rural and remote communities, where the need for health care is most acute? What is the Albanese Labor government doing for us?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the nine urgent care clinics opened in Victoria, six are within 25 kilometres of Melbourne's CBD—and 550 kilometres from where I live. The other three are in Shepparton, Geelong and Ballarat—all large regional towns that already have ample healthcare facilities. Mind you, I'm sure they would complain that they don't have enough. Why isn't the government prioritising Mildura, Horsham or Swan Hill in my electorate of Mallee? Does the government plan to provide those communities with urgent care clinics, where they are urgently needed? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some might accuse me of being cynical, but from where I'm sitting it looks like the Labor government are doing with this policy what the Labor government do with all their policies: ignoring regional communities, who desperately need help, in favour of metropolitan and large regional centres who vote for them. Labor know most rural and remote communities don't typically favour them at election time, so when they get into power they just cut off the lifeblood of these communities and leave us to die on the vine. It is disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final analysis, however, this entire debate is practically moot from the perspective of people doing it tough in the rural and remote communities that I represent. The fact is, urgent care clinics might do more harm than good in country towns where there aren't enough GPs as it is. Who is going to work in the care clinics? I know of one GP who's been taken out of his practice to work in the clinic. Nurses who already have more patients than they can handle, and who are already close to burnout, will be diverted to staff these clinics. It's a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it won't work where I come from. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing the government could do to channel more doctors to where they are most needed in country Australia would be to reverse the perverse decision to expand the distribution priority areas to include suburban and outer metropolitan regions. They won't, of course, because they expanded them for political reasons: to win votes in those urban electorates. Let's face it: Labor is deaf to the needs of regional electorates. Fancy politicising health! Who would have thought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the DPA as implemented by the former coalition government was to address the maldistribution of doctors in rural areas. By extending it to most suburban areas of Australia, the Labor government has completely undermined the purpose of the DPA. The number of international doctors moving away from rural areas as soon as Labor made the expansion public increased by 57 per cent in just six months to the end of 2022, according to Senate estimates. If the government wanted to do something about the provision of health care in rural towns, it would reverse the expansion of the DPA, urgently. But the truth is that the government doesn't want to do anything for remote towns on health policy, or any other policy in regional centres. We know why: because there are no votes in it for them. That's cynical, but it's self-evident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the member for Hawke assure this chamber that the Labor government's urgent care clinics are intended for all Australians? Or are they only going to communities who vote Labor? If they do eventually get to remote communities, where they are needed most of all, can he assure this chamber that there will be a sufficient health workforce available to staff these clinics? Will the Labor government reverse their decision to expand the distribution priority areas, and what is the government planning to do to solve the chronic shortage of healthcare workers in regional and remote Australia?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I thank my mate the member for Hawke for bringing the motion forward. Health care should be accessible to everyone regardless of their income, but the sad reality is that too often people find it too hard to find a doctor who bulk-bills. This means that people are choosing between paying to see a doctor and covering other essential costs. We know that, when we are unwell, we want to see a doctor as soon as we possibly can, but too often people are finding it hard to get in to their GP. This means that people are left to suffer while waiting days before getting a medical opinion. I strongly believe in two things when it comes to health care: when you need help, you should be able to get it, and your Medicare, not your credit card, should be your ticket to high-quality, world-class health care. That should just be part of the privilege of being an Australian, and once upon a time this was the case. Somewhere along the way, we lost our way and became a country where health care is more accessible and more affordable for some than it is for others. This is wrong. Someone earning a healthy wage is not more deserving of quality health care quickly available to them than someone who is struggling to put food on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I am proud to be a member of this government, which actually is strengthening Medicare, not cutting it. This government is delivering 58 Medicare urgent-care clinics. These clinics are so important. When you go to the emergency department of a hospital, you're having a bad day. Too often someone's bad day is made even worse by having to wait hours to be seen by a doctor. This is because our emergency departments are under too much pressure, but the 58 Medicare urgent-care clinics will play a major role in taking away some of this pressure. These clinics are a way to make it easier for Australian families to see doctor when they need to. Some things are urgent but not life threatening, but sometimes the only option is to go to the emergency department, especially when it can take days to get to a GP. This adds to the pressure facing our hospitals. Having a Medicare urgent-care clinic near you means that, if you need medical attention urgently but are not in a position which is life threatening, you won't be stuck waiting in an emergency room for hours and hours. You won't be left hanging, waiting for the next available appointment for your GP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only will these clinics relieve the pressure on emergency departments; they will also bulk-bill. All you need when attending one of these clinics is your Medicare card. Regardless of your financial situation, you will have the care available to you when you need it. This is the way it should be, and my electorate is lucky enough to be receiving one of these new Medicare urgent-care clinics in Cessnock. I'm excited to say that this clinic is scheduled to be opened next month. It was an honour to have the Prime Minister come to my electorate during the federal election campaign and announce that Cessnock would be receiving one of these clinics. I know from speaking to people around Cessnock that this clinic will be well received and will definitely be used by many who need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cessnock is a perfect case study for why these clinics are so desperately needed. Cessnock is rapidly growing, with a population edging over 60,000, but the hospital has not kept up with the population growth. This is not a reflection on the staff; they are all amazing and do a great job. To them I say: thank you for the hard work that you all put in and the hours you do and efforts you make to keep us all safe and well. But the emergency department is just under too much pressure. Making matters worse, there are limited GPs which do have bulk-billing available, and the ones which do are under lots and lots of pressure right now as well. The urgent-care clinic will mean that Cessnock's growing population will not have to wait hours in the emergency room at the Cessnock Hospital or be forced to make the half-hour drive to Maitland Hospital to be seen by a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate and the community of Cessnock need this clinic, and I want to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for Health for looking out for the health of the people in the Hunter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  Far be it from me to offer advice to the new backbencher, my good friend the member for Hawke, on this motion, but it does remind me of another situation where Labor have gone out and claimed a victory before it happened. I was reflecting on this, and remembering when the then opposition leader introduced himself to Arnold Schwarzenegger as the next Prime Minister of Australia. It was a little cringeworthy, but there's a lesson to be learned: don't get out too early and claim the win before it has happened. That might be something to say here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very clearly, we're talking about delivery of 58 of these urgent care clinics but, by their own admission, it's only 16. I point out, as have others previously, that eight of those are merely rebadged urgent care clinics that were delivered by the Victorian state government. So we're down to eight and we're off by 50-odd, but it's a good start. I join in the condemnation that has been engaged in gleefully on my side in pointing out this error in factual content in this celebration. But, firstly, I just want to sum up what I believe to be the government's defence against claims that they haven't actually done what they said they were going to do. When I go through it, at best it comes down to this: our promises were so watery, tempered and vacuous that how could you possibly hold us to account? That seems to be the defence here, 'We stumbled into this.' The first announcement was that they were going to deliver it in the next year and then they doubled down by saying, 'Yes, we'll deliver these by the beginning of the financial year 2023-2024.' So it's, 'We stumbled into this, and near enough is good enough.' Off by 50, but 50 out of 58 seems to be the defence that we have.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In seriousness, and not making light of it, I come from a region known for its health care, where health care is the largest employer in town and has been for a long time. Toowoomba services much of south-western Queensland. We draw people up from the Lockyer Valley and also service a lot of northern New South Wales. People come to our region for health care because we have outstanding health facilities, and we have done so for quite a long time. But I guess this raises the point that this was a good promise to make—this was a very good promise for an opposition to make going into an election, because it matters. Looking after health care matters, and I think that's important to acknowledge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my hometown I do see ambulance ramping and I see people choosing to go to the emergency department rather than to a GP, and I see those things on a regular basis. These are problems that we must face. I know that it's happening in Toowoomba, in Queensland and around Australia—these are challenges that are felt. I ran my last survey recently and, once again, the issues that came up in Toowoomba were crime, the cost of living and health care. People move to Toowoomba expecting great health care to be provided continuously, so when the then opposition made these commitments they were good commitments. I think people expected that when they became the government, when they had the power to deliver on their promises, that they would. If I were just walking in here today and read this statement then I would think: 'Fantastic, they did! Look at this: 58 of these have been delivered. What a fantastic outcome!' But of course we find that only 16 have been delivered and that eight of those were actually just rebadged and were delivered by somebody else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear I'm putting a bit of a wet blanket on the celebrations by the government, but they are premature. What we can say is that this is the continuation of a theme from this government: making great promises and then failing to deliver them when they have the power to deliver them. Of course, there's not a person in Australia who hasn't heard the number 275. That was a significant promise made 97 times—that's the other number we all know, $275 repeated 97 times. It's a promise that was made and a promise that wasn't delivered. There were cheaper mortgages, an amazing promise for any government to make, 'We're going to make mortgages cheaper.' My favourite one, though, was the now Treasurer making the claim that there was much they could do about the cost of living, including reducing the cost of groceries. What an incredible promise to make and what an incredible promise to break.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In all these areas, these are important issues; these are issues that are important to Australians. Labor recognised that they were important but they have now walked away from commitments to deliver them. I don't think they realise just how important they were to Australians but they were important to their campaign to win government, and this falls into farce when it is interrogated in any way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National School Chaplaincy Program has supported the wellbeing of students and school communities since its establishment in 2006. The program supports more than 3,000 school communities each year. The National School Chaplaincy Program has played a valuable role in supporting student wellbeing in school communities in a variety of ways, adapting delivery for both the student and the school environment. Each school has bespoke arrangements, often determined by need, location and the sociodemographic make-up of the community. Types of offerings are far reaching and can include individual student support, breakfast clubs, simply checking with students during lunch breaks or even joining a game of soccer. There is indirect support as well, with services for the broader school community, teachers, support admin staff, parents, carers and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent review of the program found that chaplains simply being present is critical because they can create a more safe and supportive school environment; identify and respond to wellbeing issues early—for example, identifying behavioural or social issues and helping students with strategies to overcome them—empower students by providing them with encouragement, advice and strategies; build relationships with students; provide a stable and consistent adult figure or role model; and be available for students by acting as an approachable go-to person that is viewed as separate from other staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Students have faced significant pressures over recent years, from natural disasters to the COVID pandemic and extended state lockdowns. We're seeing a decline in student participation in sporting activities and community events, exacerbating social isolation and loneliness. There was a report yesterday that found that—as reported on 3AW, which drew my attention to it—loneliness is a factor across our society, but the report found it was most prevalent in 14- to 24-year-olds. They had the biggest problem with loneliness, and it talks about that isolation. The number of young people experiencing mental health challenges has also risen over recent years, from one in five children to one in four. The current cost-of-living pressures being faced by families across the country only exacerbate that pressure and highlight the need for more of these trusted services like the National School Chaplaincy Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key measures in the budget for students is the student wellbeing boost, a Labor election commitment. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised that this would fund school counsellors and psychologists, with extra funding for camps and excursions, as well as sporting and social activities, that improve children's wellbeing. The total commitment of the package was $203.7 million over two years, and this included $10.8 million to develop a mental health check tool. This left $192.9 million to deliver mental health and wellbeing support services to students. The department advised that there are around 4,046,000 primary and secondary students in Australia. If you deduct that $10.8 million, which is going to be used to develop a mental health check tool, this leaves around $47.67 per student. What sort of wellbeing boost can be delivered for $48?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 10,000 public submissions were made to the government. A high proportion of respondents—25 per cent—were parents and guardians, 14 per cent were other members of the public and 14 per cent were teachers. More than 43 per cent of respondents to the survey were based in Queensland, and 74 per cent of those were not school based stakeholders. The evaluation found that the National School Chaplaincy Program allowed a holistic approach to wellbeing, meaning chaplains could work alongside students and others to identify and respond to different wellbeing needs. This means chaplains can identify and respond to all wellbeing needs—mental, physical, social, spiritual, intellectual and economic. It's a great program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a chaplain at school. I went to a church based school. Our chaplain was a popular member of the staff contingent, and I remember with fondness his ability to move easily amongst the students. This program has been an excellent program, and I expect the government will continue on in support of students at this time when they've never needed this program more than they do today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know, thanks to the Productivity Commission's recent report, that one in five young people from 11 to 17 years of age experience a high level of psychological distress. This reality should be unacceptable to us all. But this is not confined to a single demographic. It affects youth across Australia, and particularly those in out-of-home care, those with disabilities and First Nations students. The upheaval brought about by COVID-19 and recent natural disasters has also exacerbated these conditions, and it has been a particularly tough time for young people in Australia over the past few years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Student attendance, as a gauge of student engagement, reflects the state of wellbeing in our educational system, and, sadly, falls in attendance have been seen in all sectors—primary and secondary, urban and rural, government and non-government schools. In 2015, nearly 78 per cent of students attended school on nine of 10 days, but, by 2019, this had dipped to 73 per cent. Following the pandemic in 2022, that rate has plummeted further to a mere 49.9 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address this crisis, the government is embarking on a transformative journey, the National Student Wellbeing Program. It's not a mere change in name; it's a promise to our students and their guardians that we are committed to their welfare. This program will empower schools to engage student wellbeing officers or chaplains. Sixty-one million dollars has been funded annually over five years, and schools can access funding of up to $20,280, with additional support for remote areas available. These officers and chaplains will provide much-needed support for students and their families. This will include pastoral care; essential services, like breakfast clubs; excursions; and workshops for parents. Their presence will help bridge the gap not only in the education system but in the broader lives of these young Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment is not solely financial, though; it is backed by passionate voices across the educational spectrum. Sally Egan, formerly of the National Catholic Education Commission, underscores the importance of these funds, saying that 'these much-needed funds will help to support the provision of additional professionally qualified staff,' and that 'addressing student wellbeing is crucial to support student engagement in learning'. Margery Evans of Independent Schools Australia has said that the measures in the budget for the wellbeing of students show that the government understands the importance of these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This initiative builds on a strong foundation. An independent review of the former National School Chaplaincy Program highlighted its significant role in supporting student welfare. The review recommended expanding qualifications to include mental health competencies. Consequently, the renamed program, the National Student Wellbeing Program, takes a more inclusive stance and allows schools and parents the choice to engage a secular student welfare officer as an alternative to a chaplain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our support doesn't stop there. The Student Wellbeing Boost is an integral part of our commitment. This is a $500 million investment aimed at helping students overcome the pandemic's mental health impacts. The Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride, notes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's been a tough two years for students and the Albanese Government has a plan to help them bounce back from the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's so important. This boost includes a voluntary mental-health-check tool, providing schools with the means to identify and assist students in need. Additionally, $192 million will be distributed to schools for mental health and wellbeing support. This can encompass hiring more psychologists and counsellors, organising activities to enhance wellbeing and implementing proven mental health initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our goal is clear: to create a better and fairer education system that caters to both academic achievement and emotional wellbeing. We envision a future where every student has the opportunity to succeed and where their wellbeing is at the heart of their educational pursuits. It is our responsibility to ensure that our schools are nurturing environments and places where our students can flourish academically and emotionally. That's exactly what we're trying to do.</span>

I recently heard from Jack from Mooloolaba, who talked about his chaplain, Chappy Stu. Jack is a family violence survivor who entered high school with a whole array of struggles. Chappy Stu took Jack under his wing, paid for leadership training, spent lunchtimes with him and looked after him. Jack went on to graduate high school with a scholarship to study law and returned to his high school to help kids just like him. He credits his chaplain for pulling him out of a downward spiral to nowhere.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our chaplains don't just transform lives; they often save lives. The University of Western Australia's national school chaplaincy evaluation showed that 87 per cent of schoolteachers, student services and executives found that chaplains made their students feel loved and safe; 81 per cent identified that chaplains enhanced students' school participation; and a majority found they positively added to learning, health promotion, filling basic material needs and cultivating a positive sense of culture and identity. These are fantastic outcomes, which show that the chaplaincy program is working. Any good government would get behind a program with this kind of support and with these kinds of outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I call on the Albanese government to continue investing in the National School Chaplaincy Program in the long term. I call on them to restore the DGR status to Scripture Union and all other charitable organisations providing chaplaincy services to schools, institutions and local communities. If the government were fair dinkum about the welfare of young people and the importance of chaplaincy to young people, why on earth would they have removed the DGR status from Chaplaincy Queensland? It beggars belief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scripture Union, Queensland's largest school based chaplaincy provider, estimates that chaplains have as many as 26,000 pastoral care conversations every week with students, their families and their teachers. An average chaplain working three days a week will have a weekly load of 23 students in need of pastoral care. I've heard stories of chaplains working 12-hour days just to fit all their work in. They're running breakfast programs before the sun rises and hosting community events long after the sun sets. School chappies show compassion and devotion to making our community safer, better engaged and more inclusive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by paying tribute to those school chappies in my electorate who go above and beyond. I want to say a very big thank you, from me and from your school communities, to Shane Brigg; Michelle Winser; Scott Carroll; Mark Green; Mel Abesamis; Justin Davis; Renee Chopping; Peta Simpson, who I saw on the weekend, and it was good to see you, Peta; Anita Kelly; Mike Turner; Chris Boughen; Megan Hayes; Brad Wooing; Theresa Sayooli; Nova van Maanenberg; Jayde Treloar; Anita Baills; Donna Turner; Mitch Lovell; Mandy McDonald; Cathie Clancy; Dave Larkin; and all those people work in this sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to many chaplaincy fundraising events. The realisation of the concept of chaplaincy, of looking after the welfare of young people in schools, wouldn't have happened but for the decision of John Howard all those years ago. We continued that funding over the nine years of the latest iteration of a coalition government. We are committed to looking after the welfare of young people. I am really concerned that the government would make this into a political statement by removing the DGR status of some of these organisations. What does the government have against these religious bodies? I do not know. I call upon them to return that DGR status today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  The National Student Wellbeing Program supports over 3,000 public schools right across Australia. One of the great improvements made by the Albanese government was to enable all state schools to have choice. Communities have the choice of either a chaplain or a qualified student wellbeing officer. This flexibility is really important for schools, as it allows them to cater for their specific needs and what suits their community. It's also important for those schools situated in lower-socioeconomic communities to have choice. Many of these schools don't have the luxury of a well-funded and well-resourced church group to help pay the wages of a chaplain. The more stretched a community is, the more chance they're unable to fund a chaplain, and—let's be honest—the kids in that school probably have more challenges. So the option to employ a qualified wellbeing officer is important for such communities. Also, not all parents or communities are comfortable for their children to speak to someone who may not hold the same faith or non-faith beliefs. The ABS tells us that less than eight per cent of Australians regularly attend religious services nowadays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Student Wellbeing Program's officers and chaplains work in collaboration with school communities to support the wellbeing of school students through providing pastoral care, organising volunteer activities with the school community, running programs such as breakfast clubs and lunchtime activities, and coordinating school excursions and parent carer workshops. In their role working with school communities, the NSWP student wellbeing officers and chaplains do not provide religious instruction or religious counselling—an important reminder. They may be of any faith or of no faith. They must not proselytise in a state school; they must respect, accept and be sensitive to other views, values and beliefs; and they must promote a safe and inclusive school community. We are talking about children here. They must comply with state and territory laws and policies in relation to child protection matters, and they must have relevant and valid state and territory working with children or vulnerable people checks. They must meet the qualification requirements of the NSWP and must undertake the cyberbullying professional learning package delivered by the eSafety Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effects they have locally can be profound. We know that. In my electorate, at Wellers Hill State School, Robyn Maxwell, besides providing pastoral care to students, parents and staff, also coordinates the Modelling Affirmation, Trust, Encouragement and Support group. At Salisbury State School, Angeline Pang works with the school student support team, including the guidance officer and welfare officer, to provide a safe place for students to talk about their struggles, such as family problems, confusing relationships, friendship issues, peer pressure, self-esteem issues, bullying, stress and anxiety. I thank Angeline. At Sunnybank State High School, Ben Archbold provides emotional and social support to the students and families by creating an environment for students to get things off their chest as well as coordinating programs to enhance students' lives, develop skills or expand students' views of the world. John Erichsen at Coopers Plains State School is involved with school camps and excursions, providing assistance in classrooms and running lunchtime programs for students and staff. Mr T at MacGregor State School only joined the school in March this year but is already busy helping students with social and emotional support and developing knowledge, understanding and skills that support learning, positive behaviour and constructive social relationships. Mrs V at Corinda State School has a professional background in special needs and disability as well as nursing and early childhood education and a diploma in social science. Well done, Mrs V. She runs positive and fun activities for students and assists in fostering a supportive and caring school community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on with many other examples of schools across my electorate of Moreton, across Queensland and across Australia where they are delivering the National Student Wellbeing Program. We know that this can be an effective program with the right people. We know that the National Student Wellbeing Program can change lives and, dare I say, even save lives. But it must have the ability and flexibility to deliver for the needs of schools and their communities. As I said, if we let chaplains only operate in schools that have the resources to pay for the chaplain, the communities that are poorest and hardest up will actually miss out. That's why we made these important changes to the National Student Wellbeing Program.</span>

The member for Ryan; the member for Moreton, who has just left the chamber and just spoke; and the member for Tangney would agree with that. The member for Jagajaga has probably been at school in more recent years than we four have. Indeed, school has changed a lot. I was complimenting your youth there, Member for Jagajaga. I know what a worthwhile contribution you make to this place. Since its establishment in 2006 the National School Chaplaincy Program has supported the wellbeing of students and school communities. When I and others went to school these sorts of programs and people were perhaps not in place, because they did not need to be, but life has changed.</span>

                  </a>  The program supports more than 3,000 school communities each year, and this is a good motion put forward by the member for Forde. It is calling on the government to do more. And why would that be necessary? Well, you only have to look at the statistics out of recent reviews et cetera, which show that each term chaplains run 5,711 programs supporting almost a quarter of a million students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly during COVID-19 we saw how tough it was for teachers—and we have many good teachers in this country—when their students weren't doing the face-to face learning. Chaplains undertook activities outside their normal duties as a result of the global pandemic, and the statistics speak for themselves. They provided care packages and food parcels—42 per cent of them were doing that. There was encouragement and morale boosting for school communities, with 46 per cent of them doing that. Just during COVID-19, the following percentages of chaplains noted somewhat more interaction online of 56 per cent; interaction via phone of 51 per cent; mental health issues of 68 per cent; family conflict issues of 57 per cent; school behaviour issues of 57 per cent; friendship and peer issues of 42 per cent; and bullying and harassment issues of 30 per cent. And they're addressing those challenges. The chaplains are very well-meaning people who have experience and expertise, and who are addressing those issues. But for the chaplains, that work may well not be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I know that the total commitment to the package by this government is $203.7 million over two years. That includes a $10.8 million contribution to develop a mental health check tool, and that's important. That leaves $192.9 million to deliver mental health and wellbeing support to students. The department advises that there are around 4,046,585 primary and secondary students across the nation. My concern is that if you take away the $10.8 million which is going to be used to develop the mental health check tool then it leaves only around $47.67 per student. We have to ask what sort of wellbeing boost can be delivered for $48?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health is such an important thing, it really is. As I said at the outset, schooling has changed. Contributions by teachers and, certainly, after-hours care have changed. In my day, often one parent went out and earned the income and the other parent, usually the mum, was at home when the kids got home. But, these days, many kids are latchkey kids. Again, that's why chaplains are important; they fill the gaps left by necessarily two-income families and they fill the gaps that are sometimes there because of family breakdown. There are all manner of reasons. But the National School Chaplaincy Program has played a valuable role in supporting student wellbeing in school communities in so many ways and in so many areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  It is so important that we do all we can to support student wellbeing. We know that the pandemic and all that came with it made it hard for students, not only in how they engaged in their education but also in the many other life skills that young people get from being in a school environment. I know from travelling around my electorate at the moment, talking to students, teachers and principals, that they're still finding that they're dealing with some of the longer-term consequences of that period we spent in COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to start by acknowledging all of the people in my community who I know spend so much time thinking about and working on helping to address student wellbeing. In particular is the work of teachers and principals in my community. The pandemic has changed the way many of them think about wellbeing, and there's plenty that's being done locally to set up new ways for students to receive wellbeing support and to feel like they have a safe place when they're at school and they're struggling—somewhere they can go for support. More broadly, in my community there are organisations which are doing great work to engage with young people. I'd like, particularly, to commend a local organisation, the Pat Cronin Foundation. It was formed by parents Matt and Robyn after their son Pat died from a coward punch—a punch in the back of the head. In the years since, Matt and Robyn have grown the foundation and they reach out to young people in schools, sporting clubs, youth groups and others to educate them about safety, respect and why violence is never the answer. I want to recognise them for the incredible work they do, and continue to do, for young people's and students' wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is funding a lot of work to support student wellbeing. I'll start by talking particularly about the Student Wellbeing Boost. This is a program that includes $10.8 million for a new voluntary mental health check tool to enable schools to ensure students get the support they need and $192 million in additional one-off funding to every school to support students' mental health and wellbeing. This is extra funding that principals can spend on supports such as extra psychologists and school counsellors, camps, excursions and activities that improve student wellbeing and wellbeing engagement in mental health initiatives. As I just said, it is so necessary at this time as all schools are continuing to think about how they can help students be back in the classroom and how they can help them with the socialisation that they missed out on during the period when we were in lockdown. I visited one secondary school in my community recently. The principal there said to me that he felt like some of the behaviour he was still seeing from students in year 9, the middle year of their secondary school, was more like what he'd expect from students in primary school. So there is a lot of work and support that we need to do. Our government is certainly, through this Student Wellbeing Boost and other programs, providing the support that's much needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to providing support through the National Student Wellbeing Program. We're providing $61 million per year for a new five-year agreement. Schools that participate in the program can receive up to $20,280 in most areas, with extra for remote or very remote schools, to engage student wellbeing officers or chaplains. This staffing, focused on wellbeing, will be supporting students and the wider school community, delivering parcel care services and delivering support services, such as breakfast and lunch clubs, excursions and parent workshops. This funding has been widely welcomed across the community and by organisations that work with and in schools. The Australian Council of State School Organisations have said they are 'extremely pleased' by the announcement the government made. The former head of Independent Schools Australia, Margery Evans, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The measures in the Budget for the wellbeing of students … show that the Government understands the importance of these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Catholic Education Commission said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These much-needed funds will help to support the provision of additional professionally qualified staff. Addressing student wellbeing is crucial to support student engagement in learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we do know there is more to be done. That is why the government has tasked the Expert Panel of the Review to Inform a Better and Fairer Education System with advising on how the next schools agreement 'can contribute to improving student mental health and wellbeing'. In its work, the panel has already stated an important point:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Students with good social and emotional wellbeing are more engaged with learning and tend to have higher levels of academic achievement and attainment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is a recognition of the challenge we have in front of us. There is a recognition of the support that needs to go into our schools. This will continue to be a focus of work for our government, and I know how important that is to my community and to communities right across Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest figures show that there are approximately 851,000 casual employees with regular working arrangements. These workers do not receive paid leave entitlements. They may struggle to make financial plans for the future. They are more likely to expect to lose their jobs for involuntary reasons, with 22.5 per cent of casual workers expected to move jobs, expecting to lose their jobs for economic reasons or expecting their seasonal, temporary, fixed-term casual jobs to end, compared to 11.6 per cent of permanent employees. They're more likely to be underemployed—17.3 per cent of casual employees are underemployed, compared with 2.3 per cent of permanent employees. They are more likely to be female—53.4 per cent of all casual employees are female, and 23.7 per cent of female employees are casual. The problem is: currently, the definition of casuals within the Fair Work Act is based only on the original offer of employment made to the employee, without taking into account any subsequent conduct of the parties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always a surprise to me, when I am talking to young people in my electorate who are in their first job, when they say to me that they are permanent casuals. I take the time to tell them that they don't exist—that 'permanent casual' is an oxymoron. But they are told by their employers that that is the status of their employment. We know that's not the case, and this government is going to do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are employers exploiting the loophole where any subsequent conduct of the parties is not taken into consideration, treating employees as casuals even if they work regular and predictable hours for long periods of time. There are plenty of casual workers who have been stuck in casual employment arrangements for too long. They are being used as though they are permanent workers, without the security of permanent employment, just because of what is written in the employment contract.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government compounded this problem. They institutionalised job insecurity for casual workers. In 2021, while the courts were considering the question of how to determine employment status, the previous government introduced legislation, as part of an omnibus bill, to legitimise a blatantly unfair definition of casual employment. Then, extraordinarily, the coalition government voted down the other provisions in its own bill. The minister at the time, Senator Michaelia Cash, and the coalition government voted against all the other parts of their own legislation. They voted against their own legislation that would have criminalised wage theft and they voted against their own legislation that would have modified the better off overall test, because the only commitment that ultimately mattered that day was to make sure that they got the section of the bill through which would take rights away from casual workers. We know what they did with penalty rates. The pattern was set. What was left was an unreasonable definition that has now been in effect for two years, a definition that effectively disregards whether or not a casual worker was objectively working in a permanent job. If the contract said you were working as a casual, that was the end of the story, even if you were being told that you were a permanent casual. This government will seek to change that this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is standing up for casual employees and will introduce a fair, objective definition of 'casual' to provide clearer pathways to permanent work. As part of the government's next set of workplace reforms, we will close the loophole that leaves people stuck with being classified as casuals when they actually work permanent, regular hours. The government will introduce a fair, new definition that will restore the traditional understanding of casual employment—that is, casual employment will be determined by considering whether there is a firm advance commitment to work, but this concept is to be understood by reference to the totality of the employment relationship, including post-contractual conduct and non-contractual mutual understandings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area of industrial relations that needs action. We need to ensure that people aren't staying casual employees, without entitlements, for longer than the employer actually sees them as casual employees. This needs to change. It needs to change for young people and it also needs to change for a lot of older people who are now being employed under this definition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I thank the member for Lalor for the opportunity to speak about industrial relations reform and how best to support Australian workers, including casuals. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> reported that the minister has declared that the next round of IR reforms will be a contest on wages. If you're listening, Minister, I'm up for that contest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start where we agree. Wage growth has been too slow for too long. This is something that workers have experienced not just under the coalition government but also under the previous Labor government. Both sides need to do better. To do that, we need healthy, productive policy debates which focus on the outcomes that will deliver for workers, as well as the consequences and trade-offs of each option. We shouldn't fight about who does or doesn't care about workers or families, or who is or isn't in the pocket of businesses or unions. Let's keep the focus where it belongs: on policies and outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is the government's policy? It's to raise wages by striking at underpayment, giving workers more bargaining power, converting more casual workers to permanent work and cracking down on platform operators with more flexible working arrangements. There are a number of trade-offs here. First is that it prioritises wage growth over everything else. For some workers, a wage rise is vitally important and, understandably, trumps all other considerations. But the Susan McKinnon Foundation has shown recently the diversity of what matters to workers. Almost a third say higher pay is the most important consideration for them, but 21 per cent rate job security, 17 per cent prefer flexibility and seven per cent say a shorter commute is more important than more pay. It's notable that almost two-thirds of part-time workers rate shift flexibility as more important than pay. For workers who value things other than wages, forcing employers to focus on pay ultimately means neglecting other important values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second trade-off is that this change is essentially a one-off benefit. Workers will enjoy wage growth while the economy adjusts to the new rules, but it doesn't provide the foundations for ongoing wage growth. If IR reform makes workplaces less flexible and less dynamic, it will be harder for firms to grow and harder for employers to fund pay rises in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third trade-off is that cracking down on new forms of work reduces competition for workers. You can protect workers' rights legally with rules and courts or economically by ensuring unhappy workers can easily and quickly find employment elsewhere. We certainly need basic rights to be protected, and I support the government's efforts to ensure this protection, but the overall balance of legal and economic protections will vary by workers and industries. We shouldn't neglect the upsides of having a lot of competing employers, and the Labor members for Fenner or Fraser know all about the dangers of monopsony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor market competition isn't just an issue for digital platforms either. Small businesses are a huge source of employment, and each tranche of IR reform has imposed significant burdens on them. The smallest have been carved out, but many small businesses such as local cafes, gyms and retailers are still affected. If we keep adding to the regulatory burden, we shouldn't be surprised if small-business owners decide to call it quits and we end up with fewer opportunities for Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can respect the government's position, but we need to ensure that the trade-offs are worthwhile. The best thing is for workers to have a dynamic labour market that supports choice, flexibility and ongoing wage growth—one that accommodates the different preferences of different employers and employees and ensures healthy competition for workers, which drives improvements in wages and conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate is just getting started, and I look forward to engaging more with stakeholders on all sides. I hope we can have a positive and constructive debate which focuses on the policy options and their trade-offs, weighs up what is practical for businesses to implement and focuses on how to better support outcomes for Australian workers and Australian businesses.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  We live in uncertain times. A decade of economic mismanagement, war raging in Eastern Europe and the enduring consequences of global pandemic put pressure on our economy—pressure that is felt the hardest by working families. Last year there were 2.7 million casual workers in Australia, 300,000 more than the previous year, and 800,000 working regular hours. These are not just numbers; those are real Australians experiencing job insecurity in an already uncertain context. Having to worry about the possibility of losing your job contributes to the anxiety of providing for your family. Casual workers don't get paid leave. Casuals may struggle to plan for the future. Casuals are twice as likely to change jobs, whether because of economic reasons or because of seasonally available vacancies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know this because I have seen the statistics; I know because I have experienced this myself. When I arrived in Australia, my first job I had was security guard. I found myself in this situation, waiting weekly for the roster to find out if the last pay slip was going to be enough. In addition to this, how many of these jobs are in industries that more often than not pay minimum wage? They are retail workers, hospitality workers, warehouse and logistics workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not overlook the fact that casual workers are more likely to be underemployed and that they are more likely to be female. Over 23 per cent of female workers are casuals. How are we going to close the gender pay gap if more women are experiencing job insecurity? I have a huge respect for casual workers. I know how hard it is going to work worrying about not being able to provide for your loved ones—those loved ones that you barely get to see because these jobs often include rotating rosters, night shifts and weekend work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a responsibility to stand up for those who are doing it tougher and to care for those who are under the heaviest pressure because those before us were incapable of empathy. Today, the coalition sit across this chamber and accusingly talk about the cost-of-living crisis and inflation, and they expect us to believe that they are the people's champions. Well, they are not. They institutionalised job insecurity. In 2021 they introduced a bill with the purpose of legitimising an unfair definition of casual employment. They did it with that sole purpose because they later voted against every other part of this legislation. They voted against criminalising wage theft. They voted against workers' interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government will do things differently. We are putting workers rights as a priority, and we are committed to improving their working conditions. We will introduce a fairer definition of casual employment with clearer pathways to job security. We will close the loophole that leaves people stuck as casuals, even if they are working regular hours. It will be at the employee's discretion to express their intention to become a permanent employee. Many will not, and they will not be forced to convert either. We are not against businesses; we are here to work together—government, business owners and workers—to get the best outcome for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be no net cost for businesses. As it is now, they will either pay casual loading or leave entitlements. They will not have to pay both. We are not doing anything special. We are just sticking to our word. We are doing what we promised, and we are making sure that no-one gets left behind.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I thank the member for Lalor for putting forward this motion. It provides me with the opportunity to advise the House on why I think the member's sentiments are misplaced at best. Again, it boils down to the Albanese government's failure to listen to the needs of rural Australia and to listen to the bush. It's another classic example of Canberra trying to ram city bureaucracy down the throats of hardworking rural businesses and their workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's little wonder that small businesses right across the north-west, the west coast and King Island are frightened. It's little wonder that our advanced manufacturers are frightened. It's little wonder that our building sector, our transport sector, our ag sector and our fishing sector are worried about the impacts of Labor's IR agenda and the ongoing viability of their businesses. These businesses are the lifeblood of our region. This is something that Labor struggles to understand. In rural Australia, a lot of the time it's just one or two of these businesses that form the very backbone of an entire community. The government must continue to support these businesses to keep them viable, not to tie them up and reduce their productivity with more red tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor had bothered to ask anyone in the bush about managing workforce challenges then they would have known that flexibility is key. I think it's important to remind the Canberra bureaucracy that not everybody clocks on at nine and knocks off at five. Across the north-west, the west coast and King Island we can't afford to have a 'clock on, clock off' mentality. We'd go broke. In our region, we've got a 'do the job' mentality—a 'complete the job and get it done' mentality. I could spend the next three minutes listing the names of business owners that have never clocked off in their working lives. They work 24/7, around the clock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that vein, I recently went along to a regional meeting of our Master Builders association in Devonport. It was a great meeting. There were a roomful of builders, and if they tell me that they've got a problem then I listen. The problem is Labor's proposed IR reforms. In the electorate of Braddon, there are just over 1,000 small building and construction businesses. Between them they employ around 4,000 tradies. That's about nine per cent of the population. For the benefit of those opposite, I feel obliged to explain how the building and construction industry actually works. We have a building sector that is a very complex, very finely tuned, well-balanced and highly efficient system of business owners, apprentices, independent contractors and subbies. That's right: subcontractors.. Yet Labor believes this successful, time-proven model needs changing—changing from a model that is flexible, independent and responsive to one that is rigid, beholden to union movements and bound by red tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this meeting, I was told that Labor's proposed IR reforms are one of the worst possible things that could ever happen to the building and construction industry in the state of Tasmania. Independent contractors and subbies could find themselves subject to changes which would ultimately force them to relinquish their autonomy and become employees. This would mean they would lose their freedom to choose their working hours, their projects and their clients and their ability to negotiate their own fees and conditions. One subcontractor said that he hopes that 'the people responsible for bringing this new legislation will be held 100 per cent accountable when the construction industry is totally destroyed'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's never a good time for government to make it harder for business owners. It's never a good time for governments to make it harder for workers or jobseekers to find flexible employment that suits their specific needs and their own requirements. Yet that is exactly what the Albanese government is proposing. Well, I'm proposing more utes and fewer suits.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  Many businesses need the flexibility of casual workers, especially small businesses. In fact, many employees need the flexibility of being casual. Musicians and artists, students, mums, carers, microbusinesses and a whole lot of other workers don't always want to be locked into a permanent part-time roster. They want the ability to pick up more shifts when their commitments allow or to move between a couple of employers when there is demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are other casual workers who are only casual because they haven't been able to move into permanent employment, even though they might have been working the same shifts for many years. There are about 850,000 casual employees with regular working arrangements. They don't have access to leave entitlements and are, in fact, in a much less stable situation than permanent workers, with job insecurity hovering constantly. It's hard to make financial plans. They're twice as likely to expect to lose their job for involuntary reasons. They're also more likely to be underemployed, and they're more likely to be female. Fifty-three per cent of all casual employees are female, and 23.7 per cent of female employees are casual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're committed to standing up for casual workers who want to become permanent employees. What we're doing is saying that, if a worker's pattern of work is no longer casual, they should have the choice to move to permanent employment and gain the benefits of secure employment. It won't be something that everyone who's in that situation actually wants to do. It means being paid a lower hourly rate in return for access to sick leave, holiday pay and other entitlements.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are a couple of things to clarify here. Casual workers already have some of the same entitlements as permanent part-time or full-time workers. For instance, under the superannuation guarantee legislation, all employers must already pay a minimum of 11 per cent super for all eligible staff, whether they're full time, part time or casual. This legislation ensures that working Australians are guaranteed to have some level of retirement savings, and we were very pleased to make that change. The 10 days domestic and family violence leave that's come into effect this year is payable to all workers, whether they are casual or permanent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things that we have already implemented to provide greater security for casual workers. But we're also going to close a loophole in the Fair Work Act that's being exploited by some employers. Currently, the definition of casual is based only on the original offer of employment made to that employee. It doesn't take into account any subsequent changes that might have occurred, or what is known as the 'subsequent conduct of the parties'. So even if people are now working regular and predictable hours, they're still treated as the casuals they were when they were first hired. They're being used as permanent workers without the security of permanent work because of what's written in their employment contract.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government compounded this problem by legislating an unreasonable definition for casuals, and that has now been in effect for two years. It basically disregards whether or not a casual worker was objectively working in a permanent job. We're going to seek to change that and introduce a fair and objective definition of casual to provide a clear pathway to permanent work. That is, a casual employment will be determined by considering whether there's any firm advance commitment to work. But this concept has to be understood by reference to the total employment situation. And there will be clear processes for changing employment status from casual to permanent which will be at the employee's discretion. When a boss expects someone to work guaranteed hours as though they were an permanent employee, the worker will have the option to say, 'I would rather be a permanent worker'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the vast majority of casuals, nothing changes: no forced conversion and no giving up the casual loading. There's no net cost to business: employers pay a loading if someone is casual and they pay a leave entitlement if someone is permanent. They don't pay both to the same person. Most people will sort this out at the workplace level, but we'll ensure that Fair Work can arbitrate binding decisions where necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't expect a large number of casuals will choose to be permanent, but there are people for whom a conversion to permanent would be life changing. It may appeal more to older workers, or to workers supporting a family, than it will to students, for instance. It's a fair approach, and it's another step to increasing security for workers.</span>

                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion, which demonstrates Labor's interventionist approach to industrial relations in this country. This motion concerns the casual workers of Australia and is a concerted effort by the government to restrict casual work and demonise those employees who, for various reasons, choose this form of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian labour market is diverse and provides various forms of work for people of different circumstances and different needs. There are currently 2.7 million casual employees in Australia. This represents approximately 23.5 per cent of all those employed. This percentage has essentially been unchanged for more than 25 years. In my electorate of Hughes there are approximately 15,000 casual workers. Casual workers receive an immediate 25 per cent leave loading on their wage instead of various forms of leave. The government is now proposing to redefine the notion of a casual employee, making it more difficult for Australian workers to choose higher take-home pay and flexibility when needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A new test on how a casual worker is defined could mean that people who have a regular work pattern can no longer be a casual employee. The casual work options are critically important to provide job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of students, parents, carers and others wanting flexibility in how and when they work and who prioritise higher take-home income over entitlements like leave. Casual work works particularly for our young, for those aged 18 to 34. Casual work works for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, however, and particularly unions, increasingly object to casual work as part of a campaign against insecure work. However, this argument makes no sense when, at present, with almost full employment and skill shortages, Australians who do not want to work casually have rarely had more options to pursue ongoing full- or part-time work. Casual work was, until recently, plagued by legal uncertainty and messy backpay risks. However, this was considered and then corrected by the High Court in 2021, resulting in the parliament legislating a clear and reliable definition of casual employment. That definition should remain. It is baffling to understand why the Labor government now wants to act against the interests of casual workers, the businesses in which they work and the wider community to deliberately recreate that uncertainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now easier than ever in the history of industrial relations in this country for casual employees to convert to permanent work, either full-time or part-time. The government has been vague in how it would redefine casual work. What is clear is that it is deliberately complicating the existing Fair Work Act to override the stated intention of an employer and an employee and the express basis on which casuals are hired, making casual work contingent on post-contractual conduct. This would require an ongoing and continuous re-examination of daily patterns of work, recreating uncertainty and deliberately reversing the successful and sensible corrections made by the High Court and parliament in 2021. It's also going to place additional administrative burdens on small businesses in particular and also medium-sized businesses. Those businesses in my electorate that I've spoken to about this have indicated that this could well result in the businesses simply cutting back on staff numbers overall, leading to increased unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another consideration is that casual employees, particularly young people, are less likely to join trade unions. Casuals can also have different priorities in enterprise bargaining to union members working full-time and part-time. Therefore, the government legislating rights to convert them from casual to ongoing employment could simply be an opportunity to repay union mates with a view to swelling the ranks of union membership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Casual work has been a legitimate part of Australian employment for more than a century. It is critical to doing business, attracting investment and supporting jobs. The government should take their hands off redefining the way that casual workers work in this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Lalor. This should come as no surprise, given the side of the chamber I'm standing on. Standing up for the rights and conditions of workers isn't just something that's in our DNA; it is something that we should be fighting for in opposition and it is something we should be legislating for when in government. As the motion suggests, this means casual workers too—a part of the workforce that accounts for one-quarter of Australia's employees. This, of course, fluctuates over time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the COVID-19 pandemic many casual workers were not eligible for JobKeeper. For employees engaged on a casual basis this was cold comfort to many trying to do the right thing as they tested positive for COVID, meaning the government had to step in to cover for them while they recovered from a virus that many of them contracted whilst at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We find casual workers forgoing entitlements, such as personal leave and annual leave, for an additional loading on their wages—whether it be 15 per cent or 20 per cent—although forgoing workplace entitlements is only a small part of the overall story. We often find casual employees in situations of underemployment, whether that be working fewer hours than they would like to or working that particular job or another job to supplement those hours in a position or industry that is lower than their levels of qualification or experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Casual engagements can be as short as the balance of the day's shift. This is what the state of play currently is given that the current definition within the Fair Work Act only concerns itself with the original offer of employment made to an employee. That definition considers the fact that for many casual employees this type of employment can be in a pattern that lasts months or, for that matter, years—or sometimes for just a shift at a time. After a certain number of rockstar shifts, there comes a time for all involved when a worker begins to feel part of the team for all intents and purposes—other than for the provisions of the Fair Work Act that is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Business groups use the word 'flexibility' as a good thing, but, as soon we consider whether an employee would like to trade in loading for the entitlements and job security of someone who has filled the same work pattern for many moons, somehow flexibility is bad. It would appear that business groups are inflexible with their definition of what constitutes the good kind of flexibility. There is indeed a place for casual employment. Many use it to work in sporadic patterns in line with their university timetables. Some use it as a way to gradually return to work. But some employees would choose to jettison 20 or 25 per cent of loading on their wages for the ability to call in sick when they are sick, take a period of annual leave to recharge their batteries without worrying about the loss of income or even be able to rest up during a public holiday that they are being paid for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we can all understand, being told that you will be engaged casually on a continuous basis by an employer offers zero guarantees that will eventuate beyond what the employee is engaged to do at the time. This precariousness hurts. It hurts on the job, seeing fellow co-workers take leave and holidays with their families. It can hurt at home, too, even in the process of trying to purchase a home. They can come to a lender, with their employer offering a pattern of casual employment dating back to kingdom come, but, ultimately, this means very little when they are employed casually.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address these issues faced by many casual workers in our labour force, the Albanese Labor government is introducing an objective definition of a casual employee to provide a clearer pathway to permanent and secure work, a clearer way for employees to discuss situations where their employment ventures across what is considered casually engaged and provisions where an employee can engage with their employer to work through a process of casual conversion, with the existing framework remaining in effect. For the vast majority of casuals, this won't necessarily have any great impact. But, for the estimated 850,000 who are engaged in casual employment on a regular pattern of work, this can mean they have a path forward toward more stable and secure working conditions with their employer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If employers continue to relent against this added level of flexibility into the working arrangements between themselves and any casual employees who have worked regularly over a large period of time, it means that, every time they use that word flexibility, it just rings hollow. I am sure that this is not actually the case, and that is why the Albanese government wants to open up and allow for a type of flexibility that appears to be craved by many industry groups. On that front, the Albanese Labor government is more than happy to oblige.</span>
