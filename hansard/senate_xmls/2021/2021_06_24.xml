                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  Labor supports the passage of the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021, but I'd like to foreshadow that at the end of my remarks I'll be moving a second reading amendment. I think all Australians would recognise that administration of the aged-care system in this country has been one of this government's greatest failures, and that is saying something. This bill will make urgent and needed amendments to the Aged Care Act to implement three measures in response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and, in the case of restrictive practices, in response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent review of legislation provisions governing the use of restraint in residential aged care</span>. It needs to be made clear that the government's response to the aged-care royal commission falls far short of where it needs to be in terms of solving a number of key issues in the aged-care system and fails to deliver enduring changes and reform for the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start with the first key change in the legislation: the overuse of restraints in aged care. Substandard care can take many forms, and the royal commission concluded that 30 per cent of older people in aged care, almost one in three, have experienced some form of substandard care. The royal commission specifically heard about the excessive use of physical and chemical restraints in residential aged care, which robs older Australians of their dignity and autonomy in their final months. Older people with mental health issues, particularly those suffering from the later stages of dementia, are often heavily medicated or physically restrained. In the final three months of 2019-20, residential aged-care services made 24,681 reports of intent to restrain and 62,800 reports of physical restraint devices. Far too many people experience the aged-care system as uncaring, unkind and even inhumane in its response to them and their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make a number of important changes in regard to restraints and restrictive practices. It will clarify the definition of 'restrictive practice' in the Aged Care Act so that it is in line with the NDIS definition and ensure that all restrictive practices that limit the freedom of movement of an aged-care resident are included. It will expand the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's ability to respond to breaches of approved aged-care providers' responsibilities in relation to restrictive practices, with new abilities to issue written notices and make applications for civil penalty orders. It will provide that the quality care principles set out clearly when an aged-care provider is able to consider the use of restrictive practices—importantly, only ever as a last resort. While it is disappointing to see the royal commission's recommendation around the introduction of independent expert approval for the use of restrictive practices, this bill will help prevent the overuse of restraints and restrictive practices in aged care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second key change in this legislation is the introduction of assurance reviews. The introduction of assurance reviews, while not specifically recommended by the aged-care royal commission, is welcome, if they do as described and increase the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the home-care system. While this move is welcome, it is disappointing that the government hasn't followed more closely the recommendations from the aged-care royal commission to increase transparency and accountability measures. We know there are many aged-care providers doing amazing work who are dedicated to the health and wellbeing of those in their care. That's not to mention, of course, the incredible work that aged-care workers themselves perform. But we also know that there are far too many aged-care providers who are not doing the right thing. While the government likes to appear to be tough on bad providers, when you dive into the detail of its response to the royal commission, so often it turns out that they're letting those providers—the bad ones—do what they want. These assurance reviews are fine, but why not make the reports and recommendations that come out of these reviews all public? Why leave this up to the Secretary of the Department of Health? This is the same person that is in charge of system governance. Could there ever be an opportunity when it wouldn't be in their interest to release one of these reviews? Labor is committed to doing things very differently here. We want to see a transparent and accountable sector, a sector where bad providers are not allowed to run riot and do what they please, as this government has let them do for so long. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third key change in the legislation is replacing the Aged Care Financing Authority. The government agreed to establish an advisory group to replace the authority, which will commence operations from July 2021, to ensure the government continues to receive advice on financing issues of the aged-care sector. A new advisory body will be established to provide advice to government on aged-care financing issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and its changes are welcome. There is no doubt that the changes to rules around the use of restraints and restrictive practices are needed. There is no doubt that transparency and accountability in the aged-care sector need to be dramatically improved. But why is this the only legislative action the government is taking right now in response to the damning and wide-ranging findings of the aged-care royal commission? Why is this the only bill we're seeing, months after the royal commission handed down its final report? Where is the sense of urgency on aged care from the Morrison government? They have received 21 expert reports into the state of aged care in Australia since 2013, reports that largely foreshadowed the shocking findings of the royal commission's eight-volume report, which told us how bad the crisis in aged care is. Given just how shocking and damning and completely unacceptable those findings were, where is the sense of urgency to fix the problems identified? Where is the sense of urgency to improve the level of care that older Australians are receiving? But maybe we shouldn't be surprised. Maybe it doesn't matter how bad things are in aged care for the Morrison government, because they like to take things slowly and take things easy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has neglected the aged-care sector for eight years. If you need any further proof of that, just look at the title of the royal commission report: <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. That is the way the royal commission summarised the work of this government over eight long years. For eight years this government has neglected older Australians who have received aged-care services. It's neglected hardworking and dedicated aged-care workers for eight years. Don't just take my word for it. The royal commission described the government's approach to aged care in its final report, where it said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At times in this inquiry, it has felt like the Government's main consideration was what was the minimum commitment it could get away with, rather than what should be done to sustain the aged care system so that it is enabled to deliver high quality and safe care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, that really does sum up the approach of this government to so many issues—in particular, aged care. What is the bare minimum they can get away with? This is an absolutely damning finding from the royal commission. The crisis in aged care has been brewing for years. The 21 expert reports that are gathering dust on the minister's desk warned the government that this was coming, but they chose to neglect the aged-care system for eight long years. It is a national disgrace, and the ministers responsible should be ashamed for the part they have played in this crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the royal commission's damning words, this government's approach still seems to be to do the minimum it can get away with. At the end of the day, this is the Prime Minister's crisis. It's happened on his watch. When Mr Morrison was the Treasurer, he even cut funding to the sector by $1.7 billion. How can anyone trust Mr Morrison to fix the aged-care crisis? How can older Australians trust Mr Morrison? How can their families trust Mr Morrison? How can aged-care workers trust Mr Morrison?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care royal commission graphically highlighted the failures of the government, failures that have happened on their watch and while they have failed to watch, failures including maggots in the wounds of residents and failures including the two-thirds of residents who are malnourished or at risk of malnourishment—that is, two-thirds of residents are literally starving in the care of their own government. How can anyone stand by and let that happen for eight long years? How can the government sit there and still refuse to show any real urgency while this is happening? They should be ashamed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government have failed to listen to Australians in aged care, to their families and to the workers in the system when they raised the alarm bells about the absolutely dire conditions in some residential homes. They've failed to listen to families about the impact on their lives of having to wait years to get high-care needs home-care packages. They've failed to listen to workers about being exhausted, about being overworked, about being under-resourced, about being underpaid and about being undervalued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who can forget the performance of the aged-care minister at the recent Senate estimates, where, yet again, he refused to back in a pay rise for aged-care workers? What a way to treat the people that we depend upon to provide services and care to the elderly in our community—our grandparents, our parents, our loved ones. Of course, this minister, along with his predecessors, failed to listen to those 21 expert reports that the government have received on the issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you ask anyone to describe the government's record on aged care in one word, they will say the same thing: neglect. But they still aren't listening, not even to the royal commission that they were forced into calling. They haven't learned their lesson, because their response to the aged-care royal commission is, as the royal commission found, the bare minimum they think they can get away with. Not a single issue is actually fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's response to the aged-care royal commission falls far short of where it needed to be. It failed to deliver enduring improvement and reforms for the long run. They've fobbed off, delayed or outright rejected key recommendations. Of the 148 recommendations, over half are not being implemented or aren't being implemented properly. So often in their response, the government claims to have accepted a recommendation. But, when you actually look at the detail, times are pushed back, sometimes by years. Key sections of recommendations are often excluded. Sometimes they say they've accepted a recommendation, but their response doesn't even pretend to match it. That is a very strange definition of the word 'accept', which is what the government claim to have done. It's the same old behaviour we've come to expect from a government that says one thing and does another—that does the bare minimum to deal with the aged-care system. This is a government that makes a big announcement but never follows through on detail—on aged care and so many other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to the royal commission falls flat in five major areas in particular. Firstly, nothing will change without reform to the aged-care workforce. There was nothing to improve wages for overstretched, undervalued aged-care workers. Secondly, the government is gifting $3.2 billion to providers via a basic daily fee increase, with no strings attached to ensure it goes to actual care or better food and not management bonuses or a new office fit-out. Thirdly, the government has failed to clear the home-care package waitlist of 100,000 people. Only 80,000 packages were included in the budget over the next two years, and thousands join the waitlist every year. The maths don't add up. This government is not even going to clear the current backlog before a single new person joins that waiting list. Fourthly, the government has ignored the recommendation to require a nurse to be on duty 24/7 in residential care. This is core to improving clinical care for frail Australians. And, fifthly, the government's promise of mandatory care minutes for each resident is also full of holes. It doesn't meet the royal commission recommendation, and we now know that cleaning and some admin will be included as care. As important as those roles are, it doesn't satisfy what the royal commission was talking about. Why bother calling the royal commission and then ignore so many of its recommendations? Why bother calling the royal commission and not fix the crisis it identifies? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's before we get to the impact of COVID on aged care. Recently we have seen the government's neglect of aged-care residents and workers play out yet again, with potentially deadly consequences. Because of this government's failures in quarantine and its failures in the vaccine rollout, we again saw COVID-19 cases in aged care. People are angry about it, and they have every right to be so. Last year we lost 685 residents in aged care to COVID-19. This government left the door open to this tragedy happening again. What residents and staff went through last year was nothing less than absolutely traumatic. Residents lost their friends and their companions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week we found out that still only 30 per cent of aged-care workers have had their first vaccination. We found out yesterday that about 15 per cent of aged-care workers have been fully vaccinated. These people were supposed to be fully vaccinated by the end of March. They're the government's top priority, and only 15 per cent of people have been fully vaccinated. If you listen to the government talk about it, you'd be unable to tell. The Prime Minister says that the vaccine rollout is not a race. The aged-care minister says he's comfortable with the speed of the rollout. Neither the health minister nor the aged-care minister can seem to get their numbers straight. Unless the government acknowledge their faults and their mistakes in aged care, how is anyone supposed to trust them to fix it? Right now there is no plan from this government, and no plan and no targets mean no urgency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, what is absolutely clear to me is that, wherever you look now, the story of aged care is: don't send the Liberal and National parties on a job you trust only the Labor Party to do. The last eight years of neglect by this government have shown another three years won't make a difference. To summarise, while we welcome the changes in this legislation, the government response to the royal commission falls far short of where it needs to be.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:46</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. The Greens welcome this bill as the government's first attempt to address the royal commission, but we don't think it goes far enough. The government's response to the royal commission is basically designed to look like they are accepting most of the recommendations of the royal commission, but, if you look at the details, in fact that is not the case. In addition, it is going to take far too long to roll out the recommendations that they do truly accept and it's going to take far too long before we see the changes needed to our aged-care system put in place. I'll come back to that in a bit more detail later on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address some of the provisions in this current bill. Restrictive practices, which are addressed in this bill, have been a serious issue in aged care for more than 20 years—a very long time. In this place a number of us, including me, have been strongly advocating to end the use of physical and chemical restraints in aged care. Restraints, including the use of dangerous antipsychotics, have for too long been used to control older people's behaviour. They've been used to quieten people because the aged-care facilities are not designed the way they should be. Instead of addressing the issue, they restrain, both physically and chemically, older people who are in need of care and need our compassion. It is not a compassionate approach to drug somebody to manage their behaviour or to physically restrain them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety found that the prevalence of restrictive practices in aged care is unacceptable and the ongoing use of restrictive practices represents severely substandard care. As expressed by the commission in their final report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The inappropriate use of unsafe and inhumane restrictive practices in residential aged care has continued, despite multiple reviews and reports highlighting the problem. It must now be stopped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My comment here is that, in terms of those reviews, governments have not enacted those recommendations. They have been slack when it comes to these issues. It's about time we finally started addressing these issues properly and sending a strong message to those providers—and I'm not using a broad brush here—who are not doing the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the minimising the use of restraints principles in 2019 represented an important step forward in regulating restrictive practices in aged care. However, as I articulated in this place, they fell short in many areas, including the absence of behaviour support plans and the absence of any requirement to gain informed consent before using chemical restraints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to note that this bill provides a stronger framework and better safeguards for the use of restrictive practices in aged care. Importantly, it aligns the definition of restrictive practices with the definition used in the disability sector. It also provides the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner with additional powers to respond to providers who break the rules around restrictive practices, including through the application of civil penalties. Another positive step forward is the requirement for providers to create behaviour support plans when using restrictive practices from 1 September this year. I believe this will help providers to think through how they are using restrictive practices and ensure that they are only used as a last resort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to go through some of the areas where the new restrictions do, unfortunately, fall short. For example, the new regulations do not apply if the use of restrictive practices is necessary in an emergency. Stakeholders noted concerns that the use of 'necessary in an emergency' is broad and subjective. COTA in particular raised concerns that there are no time lines in the regulations attached to an emergency. They believe that no more than seven days should be the absolute maximum period that emergency rule should apply. Allowing aged-care providers to determine when an emergency has passed could provide a loophole. From our discussions with the department we understand that using the emergency provisions on the same person more than once will constitute a red flag for the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. I seek clarification on this matter to ensure this is the case, and I will continue to follow this up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission recommended that restrictive practices should only be used after alternative evidence based strategies have been explored, applied and documented. I am concerned that the regulations qualify the need to use alternative strategies through the phrase 'to the extent possible'. This leaves the door open to aged-care providers to determine alternative strategies only to the extent that they believe is necessary. The royal commission also recommended that restrictive practices should be prohibited unless recommended by an independent expert. The regulations require an approved health practitioner to approve the use of restrictive practices. However, it is unclear whether these health practitioners will need to be independent of the facility and the provider—there is a conflict of interest if they are the health practitioner of the actual facility and the provider. As a result, aged-care providers may be able to use in-house health practitioners to approve the use of restricted practices, which, as I said, is in my opinion a clear conflict of interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The draft regulations include chemical, physical, environmental and mechanical restraint, and seclusion, as restrictive practices. Some providers were concerned about the need to obtain consent from substitute decision-makers where a person lacks the capacity to give their consent, particularly in the case of locked or secure facilities, and the impact this could have on public guardians. My understanding is that secure facilities were already in the scope under the existing minimising the use of restraints principles. So providers should have been seeking consent for locked or secure facilities under existing provisions. This is a really important point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to see that the draft regulations were put out for public consultation as an exposure draft, and I understand that the department did not receive much feedback and anticipates that the final version will be similar to the draft. While the regulations will provide more guidance and stronger protections, it's clear that we need to address structural issues in aged care if we are going to end the use of restrictive practices altogether—things like staff training, minimum hours of care, adequate mixtures of staff and enough registered nurses. The royal commission found that the overuse of restrictive practices in aged care often comes from a lack of knowledge about restraints, their impacts and alternatives. The department must ensure that we have adequate training and education in place for providers if they are going to successfully end the use of restrictive practices in aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also introduces home-care assurance reviews of the delivery and administration of home care. Under the changes, the secretary will be able to collect information in relation to assurance reviews. The secretary will also be able to publish information on providers who do not comply with notices to produce or do not provide reasonable assistance. My understanding is that the government, as they said to the committee, plans to undertake 500 home care assurance reviews in the first 12 months with a focus on unjustified administration charges and overheads. Given that there are around 928 home-care providers operating in Australia, not all providers will undergo assurance reviews, which is a concern. The department also clarified that the results of the reviews will be published on its website. While I welcome attempts by the government to improve the transparency of home-care fees, it's critical that the government takes more action to improve transparency and accountability across the whole aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill abolishes the Aged Care Financing Authority. Our understanding is that a new advisory group, reporting to the new National Aged Care Advisory Council, will replace ACFA from July. We don't have further details about the new advisory group, including who will sit on the group and what level of independence it will have. Given that the ACFA will be abolished, we expect that the government will publicly commit to a process for commissioning and publishing independent reports on the financial performance of the sector. Today I'm calling on the government to ensure that there is no gap between the dismantling of the authority and the introduction of the new group that will provide advice on financing issues in aged care, and to continue to fund and publish independent annual reports on the financial performance of the sector. The government has started its reform agenda but there is still much work to be done and many unanswered questions. It's up to the government to lead on these reforms. We will continue to do everything we can to demand significant ongoing funding commitments to achieve the structural reforms required to build a safe, accessible and high-quality aged-care system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage, we have still got far too many issues going on in aged care. We still have enormous waiting lists in aged care. We still have the ridiculous situation where you have to wait for nine to 12 months for level 3 and 4 packages and, in the meantime, you get put on interim packages. For some interim packages the waiting time is nine to 12 months—and that's while you're waiting for your other package, which also has a waiting time of nine to 12 months! It's an absolute farce! This situation needs a lot more urgency than the government is providing to these reforms. Where is the money in the budget for workforce pay rises? We get the weak excuse from the government that they're waiting for the Fair Work case, when anybody who has any understanding of aged care knows that carers, nurses and other personnel working in aged care need a wage rise. Put it in the budget!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not going to improve aged care until we have a workforce that is significantly increased. Everybody knows that we need a significantly increased workforce and that we need to pay them properly for the work they do and the dedication they show. Why wasn't it in the budget? Why wasn't it there? Don't hide behind the Fair Work case. They're taking the case because, for years and years, aged-care workers, personal care workers and nurses have been underpaid. We haven't had the right skill mix. You can't get your workforce to the level you need until you're paying them properly for the hours they put in and the work they put in. We can't deliver the hours of care, for those older Australians in aged care, until we have a workforce that is properly supported with ongoing training and other ongoing supports and until we have proper ratios in aged care. The way the government's going, we are years and years and years away from achieving the sort of aged-care system that Australians can only dream about at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are we not addressing the issues, and not only has the government not put in the funding to properly pay aged-care workers, but we can't even get the vaccination process working properly. We can't get older Australians vaccinated, and we can't get our workers in aged care vaccinated, despite the deadly and awful lesson that was learned in Victoria last year, when we saw so many deaths. You would have thought that, no matter what, the government would have guaranteed that those living in aged care, and those providing the care and working so diligently in aged care, would have been vaccinated by now—all those who wanted it. You would have thought that would have happened, at the barest minimum. But no. It hasn't happened, nor has it happened in the disability sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a long way to go before we fix aged care in this country. Where's the government's commitment to all those other recommendations and making sure it happens at the pace that is needed? It isn't there, and it needs to be there. The Greens will be supporting these amendments, and I indicate that we are supporting Senator Watt's second reading amendment, because we need a greater sense of urgency to make sure those home-care packages are rolling out, that we've got the workforce there and that the provisions that we are agreeing to today, such as those on restrictive practices, are put into operation as soon as possible so that we can guarantee to older Australians that they're not going to be restrained, either physically or chemically, when they enter aged care.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. This bill will make urgent amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act 2018 to implement three measures in response to recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. In the case of restrictive practices, this bill responds to the independent review of legislative provisions governing the use of restraints in residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission handed down a damning account of the state of Australia's aged-care sector. It's a national disgrace. Scott Morrison is responsible for the aged-care system, he is responsible for the funding cuts and he is responsible for the terrible neglect identified by the royal commission. The Liberals failed to listen to Australians in aged care, to their families and to the workers. The Prime Minister failed to listen to the 22 expert reports and now even the report of his own royal commission. So we argue that this is not 'a once-in-a generation reform to aged care'. The Liberals had ample opportunity to reform the sector, and now I feel that they have fallen short again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In question time yesterday, we learnt that only 15.6 per cent of residential aged-care staff have been fully vaccinated. They still don't have a register set up to track the number of staff who have been vaccinated. Just a few months ago, aged-care workers were told they will get vaccinated on site in aged-care homes. That never eventuated. The Morrison government also said that aged-care workers would be first in line. Now they're being told that they have to drive hours out of their way in their own time at their own expense. These are some of the lowest-paid workers in this country, yet they're on the front line during this pandemic. They don't necessarily have ready access to transport, and they have other commitments. So these workers should have been able to be vaccinated in their workplaces as a matter of priority. The federal government, the Morrison government, have failed in the rollout of the vaccine program in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's go back to the bill. Schedule 1 of this bill makes amendments to further strengthen the legislation on the use of restrictive practices in aged care. The bill defines the term 'restrictive practices' in the Aged Care Act in alignment with the definition applied under the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the NDIS. This is something that Labor welcomes, as the new definition is clearer than the one it replaces and ensures that all restrictive practices are included.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also expands the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's ability to respond to breaches which approved aged-care providers are responsible for in relation to restrictive practices, which is very important. The commissioner can issue written notices to providers who do not comply with their responsibilities and can also apply a civil penalty order if a provider does not comply with a written notice. The schedule will also provide that the Quality of Care Principles must set out matters in relation to restrictive practices, including when an aged-care provider is able to consider the use of restrictive practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While, at first glance, this schedule does provide more guidance, from my work as the chair of the scrutiny of bills committee I'd have to question why a number of key matters and definitions regarding when it is appropriate to use restrictive practices will be left to delegated legislation. It is concerning that matters such as these cannot be scrutinised appropriately by the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, this schedule seeks to provide that the Quality of Care Principles may provide that the requirements of the principles do not apply if the use of restrictive practices is necessary in an emergency. This provides the minister with extensive power to determine in delegated legislation when the requirements for the use of restrictive practices no longer apply. I would add that there is also nothing in this bill, on the face of it, which defines what constitutes 'an emergency'. The royal commission specifically heard about the excessive use of physical and chemical restraints in residential aged care which rob older Australians of their dignity and autonomy. Older people with mental health issues—particularly those suffering from later stages of dementia—are often heavily medicated or physically restrained. It is so important that we help prevent the use of restrictive practices and restraints so that older Australians can age with dignity. I still question why the minister has so much discretionary power to determine when it is appropriate and why a definition for 'an emergency' is not in this bill. I would argue that 'administrative flexibility' is not a significant or sufficient response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second schedule of this bill will amend the Aged Care Act to empower the Department of Health secretary to conduct reviews. These reviews will ensure the arrangements for the delivery and administration of home services are effective and efficient. The assurance reviews will inform the continuous improvement of the home-care policy and the education of approved aged-care providers. The introduction of these reviews, while not specifically recommended by the aged-care royal commission, is welcomed. However, that is only if they do as described and increase the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the home-care system. We know that there are many aged-care providers doing amazing work who are dedicated to the health and wellbeing of those they care for—and it's not just the providers but, more importantly, the workers who are carrying out this care—but we also know that there are far too many providers who are not. It is highly concerning that an additional $17.7 billion will be spent throughout the aged-care sector without what Labor would deem an adequate level of transparency and accountability measures. Every dollar that is spent in the aged-care sector by the government should be going into care and not providers' profits, and we fear that, given the current parameters, this cannot be guaranteed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third schedule makes amendments relating to the Aged Care Financing Authority. The government replaced ACFA with a new working group that will report to the National Aged Care Advisory Council. The council was recommended by the royal commission under recommendation 7. Also, it was about time the Liberals overhauled the Aged Care Funding Instrument. We've known for many, many years—for the eight years this Liberal government has been in power—that it was an outdated system and did in fact need replacement. The government has just sat on reports, and this report, in particular, they have had for the last four years. So this government has been dragging its feet, trying to delay putting appropriate levels of funding into the aged-care sector. It then had to call its own royal commission into its own failings and five or six ministers that have had responsibility for aged care in this country in the last eight years. It finally called a royal commission into its own failings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is disappointing to see that the government's response to the royal commission's final report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, falls short of resolving a number of key issues within the aged-care sector. It will also fail to deliver the improvements and reforms for the long term. Mr Morrison has failed to listen to Australians in the aged-care sector, he's failed to listen to the families and in particular he's failed to listen to the warnings of those people working in this sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 22 reports handed down to this government alone, and they've failed to act. Now we see they're still failing to act on all the recommendations of their own royal commission. The Liberals are failing to deliver significant reform. We know that the aged-care workers in this country do a fantastic job. The majority of them are very dedicated, but they're overstretched and they're underpaid. We know that there was an opportunity for this government to put in a recommendation of support to ensure that aged-care workers in this country received a pay rise. But what did the government do? Nothing at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the number of aged-care workers will need to almost triple to over a million workers by 2050. How can we attract people into the sector if we are allowing wages to currently stay at $21.09 an hour? How can we improve the care and quality in the aged-care sector if we don't acknowledge that properly remunerated staff are warranted and deserved in this country? Yet they're sending $3.2 billion to providers with basically no strings attached. There is no real guarantee that any of that money will go to provide actual better care, better food and better pay to these workers. That money should not be going into management's fitting-out of their offices. That money needs to go to ensuring that older Australians are treated with dignity and they get the care that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also ignored the recommendations of the royal commission to provide a nurse seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Without having appropriately staffed nursing available to them, we see older Australians ending up in accident and emergency, being left in emergency rooms, waiting for hours and hours to be treated. This is not good enough. We need to see the full recommendations, the 250 mandatory care minutes per resident provided in residential aged care. Again, staffing levels are central to many of the areas of quality care problems that we have seen and that have been reported over so many years being rectified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am happy to say that the Tasmanian Liberal government yesterday made the announcement that they're putting $3 million into training for aged-care and disability workers. Fantastic. I always acknowledge money that's invested into these areas. But, again, what we aren't seeing is any assurances that we are going to stop what we see as a transient workforce within the aged-care sector. People are using it as a measure to have a job while they're looking for something that pays better wages. What we need to ensure is that we have the best trained, most highly skilled, most motivated and best paid workforce in this sector and in disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if we go to the area of home-care packages, we see the failings of this government under Scott Morrison, who used this sector as his own personal ATM. He left minister after minister who has failed in this sector day in, day out. He reappointed Senator Colbeck as the minister with responsibilities in this area. I must say, most of the real decisions have been made by Minister Hunt. What is left is somebody who we have seen demonstrate failure to be across the issues in this chamber every single time he's asked a question in relation to aged care or vaccination of older Australians and aged-care workers. This government has failed to deliver home-care packages in a timely manner to people who have been assessed as needing the highest care in this country, the level 4 package. They have announced more money to go into aged-care packages but they've done nothing to ensure that there are aged-care workers who can deliver level 4 and level 3 care in a timely manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that uses smoke and mirrors. They like to make these announcements but they are never there for the follow-up. As a former Treasurer, Scott Morrison is responsible for taking out billions of dollars. Time and time again he has used this sector as his own ATM and spent that money in other areas. Now we are in a crisis. We have been in a crisis for the last eight years. We've seen this government fail to turn this around at every opportunity. They failed so much that they had to call a royal commission into their own failings. That's how good this government is! Mr Morrison says to the Australian people, 'Aged care is a priority.' Well, I would hate to see what this Prime Minister would do if this weren't a priority, because it's a bungled system that has been gutted by this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281603" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021. This bill is in response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which handed down its final report in March this year. While Labor supports this bill, it has to be said that the government's broader response to the royal commission has been inadequate. I want to use this opportunity today to speak to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have failed to provide an adequate and sufficient plan to provide the reform to the aged-care sector that we know we need. They've failed to listen to Australians in aged care and their families and to the workers in our aged-care sector. They are not stepping up to deliver all of the enduring improvements we know are necessary to ensure that all Australians live out their later years with the dignity that they deserve. Let us be clear: aged care is a responsibility of the federal government. This makes aged care Prime Minister Morrison's responsibility. The Prime Minister, as we've seen time and time again, likes to shirk his responsibilities. There's always someone else to blame. It's always someone else's problem. But on aged care he cannot shirk his responsibilities. The job of regulating aged care and the providers within it falls squarely on the shoulders of our federal government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For eight long years the federal government has presided over a system that the commissioners evidently felt, in handing down their interim report, could be summarised in just one word: neglect. The royal commission heard absolute horror stories of the treatment of older Australians, of black and blue bruises from falls ignored or dismissed, and of the abuse of chemical and physical restraints. We heard that an appalling two-thirds of aged-care residents were malnourished or at risk of being malnourished. That's two-thirds of our elderly fellow citizens in residential care not getting enough to eat. We heard of people being fed on just $6 a day. It's absolutely grotesque. In the last two years alone, of 100,000 people, we've had 28,000 Australians die while waiting for home-care packages which would allow them to enjoy some independence while they remain well enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We owe so much more to older Australians. In many ways, they built the society that we share now. Everyone knows someone in aged care, has a loved one in aged care or expects to have a loved one in aged care at some point. All of our elderly—everyone, every Australian—in aged care deserves so much better than what this government has presided over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor supports this bill, it has to be said that the government's broader response to the royal commission has not been good enough. Through the term of this government they've received 22 reports about the state of aged care. Now they are ignoring or failing to fully accept key recommendations of their royal commission. The government's failure is particularly pronounced when it comes to workforce issues in our aged-care sector. They have ignored, delayed or outright rejected key recommendations designed to address the poor wages, conditions and job security of workers in this sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows the vast majority of aged-care workers are dedicated individuals who go that extra mile to do what they can with already stretched time and resources to care for people's loved ones. I know many of them suffer immense distress when they're not able to provide the level and standard of care they know residents deserve, because they are not being supported to do so. These workers are truly essential to our society and to our economy, and how incredibly important and essential that their work is has been on full display these past couple of years. But you would never know that from the way that they've been treated by this government and the way their needs as a workforce have been ignored. The government has failed to implement the commission's recommendation of minimum standards for the amount of time qualified staff spend each day with residents, and the Prime Minister needs to explain why he has failed to accept this recommendation and also the recommendation that a nurse be on premises at all times in residential facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been consistent in arguing that nothing will change in aged care without better support for the workforce. The Productivity Commission estimates Australia will need 700,000 additional aged-care workers by 2050 due to our ageing population. It can and should be an opportunity for well-paid, secure and profoundly meaningful work for hundreds of thousands of Australians, yet the government has no plan to increase wages of nurses and carers. Can they name just one meaningful thing they've done to provide genuine and meaningful support to workers in this industry or to make it an attractive industry—one that matches the level of importance to our society that it deserves? It is for these reasons, amongst others, that Labor is moving a second reading amendment to the bill, calling out the government's broader failures in aged care, and I hope it enjoys the support of this chamber. After eight long years of neglect of our aged-care system and our older Australians, it is only Labor who can be trusted to design and implement the real reforms necessary to ensure every Australian gets to age with dignity, comfort and respect, unlike this government, who has taken a bare-minimum approach rather than implemented the deep structural reform required to fix residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude my remarks, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the incredible aged-care workers in my home state of South Australia, some of whom I was lucky enough to meet when they came on a parliamentary delegation recently. They were in all sorts of roles, not only caring for residents but also working in more behind-the-scenes roles in our aged-care facilities: working as cooks and attendants, supporting our elderly in need. These workers had harrowing stories for me of the things they wanted to be able to do and the support they wanted to be able to provide to the residents in their care, but they felt so under supported and undervalued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly during this pandemic, where their work has become incredibly dangerous, they've feared what might happen if they contract COVID and pass it on to residents within their care. They've been very distressed about that reality, and they're very distressed about failures in the vaccine rollout, failures that mean that they're not protected at work, that they're not able to provide the protection for the residents they care for and that the residents they care for aren't protected to the extent that they should be. It's very distressing for these workers. I just want to acknowledge them and acknowledge the incredible work they're doing. They're waiting for more support from the federal government. They're waiting to be heard and to be given the reforms in their sector which mean they can go into work each and every day and provide that care and assistance to those that they look after. Labor supports those workers. We're listening to them. We understand how very, very tough it has been. We will continue to raise these issues in this chamber to make sure that aged-care workers' voices are heard and to make sure that residents in aged care are heard and supported. It's just not good enough to let these workers and these residents be ignored. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's findings were absolutely harrowing. I know everyone in this chamber found them deeply distressing and disturbing. So now, as legislators, it's our opportunity to act to get it right, to look at the recommendations and to not do the bare minimum to just get by but to do everything we need to do to ensure that we are doing the absolute maximum to support our workforce and those living within aged care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor will be supporting this bill. We are supporting this bill because it goes some of the way towards fixing serious problems within our aged-care system. But we do not stand here pretending it fixes everything. We think it does the bare minimum that it needs to do, and that's simply not good enough. It's simply not good enough for workers in residential aged care; it's simply not good enough for residents, who need genuine and meaningful reform. But, that said, we will support it. We need some action. We will be moving amendments to try and get this right, to get it done better.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I thank senators who have contributed to the debate. The Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 1) Bill 2021 makes three urgent changes to deliver the first stage of aged-care reform in response to the royal commission and to ensure that senior Australians receive the high-quality and safe aged care they deserve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2021, this bill introduces important limitations on the ability for approved providers to use restraints and strengthens protections for aged-care recipients from any abuse associated with this practice. The term 'restraint' will be replaced with 'restrictive practices', continuing regulatory harmonisation with the disability sector. Further and more specific details of the strengthened obligations on approved providers will be prescribed by the Quality of Care Principles 2014. The bill and the amended principles provide a framework to minimise the use of restrictive practices. The amendments do not authorise the use of restrictive practices where it is otherwise unlawful. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's powers will be expanded to include the ability to give a written notice if a provider does not comply with its responsibilities relating to the use of restrictive practices and the ability to apply for a civil penalty order if they do not comply with the written notice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes an annual program of risk based assurance reviews of home-care providers. The Secretary of the Department of Health will be able to require approved home-care providers and their employees to provide information for the purposes of program assurance and to prepare and publish reports on the assurance reviews. This builds on our existing work to improve transparency of the aged-care sector and fosters community confidence in the costs of the care they receive. The bill also repeals the requirement for the minister to establish the Aged Care Financing Authority, the ACFA. An advisory group will be established to replace ACFA from July 2021 to ensure the government continues to receive advice on financing issues of the aged-care sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I thank senators for their contributions to debate on this bill. The health, safety and wellbeing of senior Australians is of the utmost importance to the government and is driving our plan for generational change of the aged-care system.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021. Labor will be supporting this bill, because we stand in support of workers across Australia who face lockdowns as a result of this government's gross incompetence in managing the COVID outbreaks, particularly the vaccine rollout and quarantine. Let's be really clear: the only reason this bill is necessary is the Prime Minister's failure on vaccines and quarantine. If the Prime Minister had done his job, we wouldn't be in this situation. This Prime Minister and this government began this year with two simple jobs: get the vaccine rollout happening and build purpose-built quarantine stations to keep Australians safe, to keep Australians in work, to keep our economy ticking over. They have comprehensively failed on both of those jobs, and hour by hour this situation gets worse. We know that Melbourne in recent weeks has been through more lockdowns because of breaches of hotel quarantine and because of the low rates of vaccination in the community—two jobs that the Prime Minister and this government have failed to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few days we've seen much of Sydney all but locked down again because of breaches of hotel quarantine and because of the low rates of vaccination overseen and delivered by this government. Only in the last hour we have learned that in my home state of Queensland we now have three cases of COVID, possibly more, and, again, what is the cause? Hotel quarantine breaches and a poor vaccination rollout. The government's failures aren't just talking points, aren't just academic exercises; they have real-life consequences for Australians. We are now in a situation where, across the entire eastern seaboard, in each of the capital cities, we are facing some combination of lockdowns, restrictions, in some cases people losing their jobs and, terribly, some people actually contracting COVID. The government's failures have consequences. The consequences are not only the need to introduce the legislation and put more of the responsibility for payments on the taxpayer; they are costing people their health, they are costing people their jobs and they are costing people their movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look around the world and see comparable nations like the US and the UK having vaccinated tens of millions of people, every week. Every week the US, for example, is vaccinating more people than Australia has managed in months. These are the nations we seek to compare ourselves to and they are so far ahead of us it is not funny. Again, because of the government's failures on quarantine and vaccination, Australians are paying the price. It is a very serious issue that this government is not taking seriously. Three capital cities on our eastern seaboard are facing lockdowns—or have just come out of them—with jobs lost, money lost out of the economy, people getting sick and the potential for things to get worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what happened in Sydney over the last few days. The numbers started out small from one hotel quarantine breach and have escalated to a point where several council areas—several suburbs—are all but shut down, and now we're seeing it in Brisbane as well. At some point, this Prime Minister has to take responsibility for this matter. He has to take responsibility for the two jobs he had coming into this year—building purpose-built quarantine stations and getting the population vaccinated. I don't remember the exact figures but I think we're talking about, at the moment, four per cent of the Australian population being fully vaccinated—four per cent! If you did an exam and got four per cent, that would be a miserable failure; you would barely even be on the scoreboard. That is the situation the government and this Prime Minister have left our country in. Again, I can't remember the exact numbers but I think we're up to 24 or 25 hotel quarantine breaches. Probably with today's example it's higher still. How many times does this Prime Minister and this government need to see quarantine breaches and poor vaccination rates before they take control? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an absolute repeat of what we saw from this Prime Minister in the bushfire crisis. He didn't hold a hose then; he doesn't hold a dose now. This Prime Minister just will not take action. What have his coalition partners, the National Party, spent the week doing? Stabbing each other in the back. How do you think Australians feel when they look at this government at the moment? </span>

                    </a>  I'll take that interjection, Senator McCarthy: total despair—and total distrust. What they see is a government that is completely focused on themselves rather than on getting Australians vaccinated and keeping them safe from COVID through quarantine stations. We know that this Prime Minister is, if nothing else, a poll-driven marketing man. Let's forget about the public health benefits of this for the moment. With every poll you look at, Australians want purpose-built quarantine stations. But we have a Prime Minister who is so belligerent, so stubborn, so focused on constructing fights with state premiers that he won't even sit down and talk about a quarantine station in Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland government has been trying for months to get this government to engage on a quarantine station, in Queensland, right next to an airport and right next to a hospital. All you ever hear from the Prime Minister is, 'There's not enough detail.' You ask, 'What detail do you need?' and he says, 'There's not enough detail.' It is absolute rubbish from this Prime Minister. He's being stubborn. He doesn't want to sit down and take control of this situation and take responsibility for what is going on and lead the country. His coalition partners, the National Party, are completely obsessed with who gets to drive in the big car, who gets the big office, who gets the biggest hat and who gets the biggest pay rise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our leader, Anthony Albanese, has said, it is time for this government to get focused: more jabbing, less stabbing. That's what we need from this government. They are so obsessed with stabbing each other in the back, which, let's face it, they've been doing for three years in the National Party. </span>

                    </a>  Yes, let's not forget the photo ops. Remember the photo op with the Prime Minister, with his Australian mask? He didn't wait to get vaccinated. He was quick out of the blocks with the V for victory sign. He had a personal victory. He got a vaccination. What about the other 96 per cent of the Australian population who can't get a vaccination because this government didn't do enough vaccine deals? The Prime Minister can travel overseas. No other Australian can. The Prime Minister can get a vaccination—two vaccinations; he is fully vaccinated—he can travel overseas, he can go and do a bit of sightseeing and he can go and have a pub crawl. You can't even have a pub crawl in Sydney, but this Prime Minister is having a pub crawl in Cornwall, overseas, half a world away. He can go and inspect the graves of his dead relatives, who've been dead for 200 years. I know Australians who can't go to the funerals of their parents and their grandparents who died last week, but this Prime Minister can do that, and of course he gets his own quarantine arrangement where he beams down, Orwellian style, into the parliament. No other Australian can get that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one rule for this government and this Prime Minister and another rule for everyone else. We see it over and over again. We see this complete failure to take responsibility that is, literally, putting Australians' lives at risk and, literally, putting Australians' jobs at risk. That's because this Prime Minister is so belligerent and so stubborn, refusing to take responsibility, and Australians pay the price. It's happening in Brisbane now, it's been happening in Sydney, it's happening in Melbourne and it won't take long, I'm sure, before it starts happening in other states and territories. It is unacceptable. If there is one thing the Australian people want this Prime Minister to do, it is to take responsibility, get us vaccinated and build purpose-built quarantine stations so that we don't have to turn on the news every night to learn about the next breach of hotel quarantine, because there will be more. Jane Halton, the government's own appointee to review the quarantine system, recommended months ago that we have purpose-built quarantine, but that was just another report delivered to this government that is sitting in the bottom drawer. They know what to do. Every expert has told them what to do—get people vaccinated, sign multiple vaccine deals, roll out the vaccine and build purpose-built quarantine stations—but they continue to refuse to do it. As I say, this has consequences. Australians pay the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to this bill, which is about providing financial assistance to some of the victims of this Prime Minister's complete failure to do his job. I'm sure that the Victorians who will receive and have been receiving these payments are grateful for the fact that payments are being made. That is a good thing. It is another example of something that Labor had to drag this government to do. We saw with JobKeeper that they didn't want to have wage subsidies. I think the Prime Minister's quote was that it was a dangerous step. We all remember the queues outside Centrelink of people who were forced onto the dole queues because this Prime Minister was too stubborn to do wage subsidies until he was dragged, kicking and screaming, into doing it. It is the same with these payments. For days we saw Victorians locked down, losing their jobs, and the Prime Minister refusing to step up: 'Oh, it's a state responsibility. It's a local government responsibility. It's somebody else's responsibility. It's anyone else's responsibility.' He's got 10 arms running around pointing at other people rather than having one finger which puts it on him. It's his job. So Victorians, I think, will be happy that they're getting these payments, but do you know what? I reckon they'd be a lot happier if they didn't have to get them in the first place. I reckon they'd be a lot happier if they could just get vaccinated and be kept safe from hotel quarantine breaches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide time limited assistance to eligible workers who are unable to earn their usual income as a result of public health restrictions. It contains two parts. The first creates a special appropriation to draw funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of the COVID-19 disaster payment over the next financial year. The second part of the bill creates a reporting requirement through the new National Recovery and Resilience Agency for payments through the special appropriation. Essentially, this bill guarantees that funding will be available to activate recovery payments for workers affected by lockdowns. That's why the opposition will be supporting this bill. It's something we called for well before the Prime Minister agreed to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill doesn't do is lock in eligibility criteria for this payment, which we know from the recent COVID lockdown in Victoria left many struggling workers and families out in the cold. Labor will continue to fight to make sure that all workers hit by COVID are properly supported by this government. Supporting this bill will not change that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Prime Minister was dragged, kicking and screaming, by the opposition and the Victorian government to provide any support to workers during this lockdown, just like this Prime Minister and this government had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to make JobKeeper payments available when COVID first hit this country. If it were up to the Prime Minister, he would have done what he has always done—blame the Labor states and then do nothing—but Australians are starting to see through this Prime Minister. The truth is that the reason were still having lockdowns and the reason why this legislation is necessary is that the Prime Minister has failed to bring this pandemic under control. He has had two jobs—the vaccine rollout and quarantine—and he has failed at both. Only about four per cent of Australia has received both doses of a COVID vaccine. We are so far back in the queue you can't even imagine seeing the front of it. Last week the government said that only one out of 11 workers were fully vaccinated. Yesterday we found out that about 15 per cent of aged-care workers have been fully vaccinated. They are priority 1a. It doesn't get any higher than priority 1a, and it's only 15 per cent of aged-care workers.</span>

Every other country around the world that we like to compare ourselves with is getting on with it. They've vaccinated millions of people—tens of millions of people—and we can't even get to five per cent, and Australians are paying the price. How much money has been lost from local economies because of lockdowns? How many jobs have been lost because of this government's failure? It continues to say it's not a race. It is a race, and we are coming bone miserable last. We support this bill but we really want to see the government do its job. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021. This bill establishes a special appropriation to allow the Commonwealth to fund the COVID-19 disaster payments. The recent two-week lockdown in Melbourne was the first following the end of the JobKeeper wage subsidy. This left many workers, particularly casual workers and those on temporary visas, without a source of income. That takes me, first off, to the fact that we are doing nothing about addressing the increasingly insecure work in this country and the fact that so many people in this country have to put together a series of casual jobs, with insecure hours, resulting in insecure wages, which leads them to being in this position where they are without income, in many instances, from the two or three casual, insecure jobs that they may have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government ended JobKeeper much too early, despite warnings that there would be more COVID outbreaks, particularly when you bear in mind the issue around the failure, the shambles, of the rollout program for the vaccines and the failures in hotel quarantining. Hotels are not meant for quarantining. They were absolutely essential as stopgap measures when the pandemic first hit, but we've had a significant period of time now to put in place secure, purpose-built quarantine facilities modelled on the Howard Springs approach. It's not as if Australia doesn't know what works and hasn't got the experts that have been providing expert advice on what does and doesn't work—not to mention the fact that, while the government mouths the words about aerosols and the need to improve ventilation, and says, 'Yes, we're paying attention to aerosols,' we still don't have nationally consistent guidelines on aerosols. They mouth the words but they're not doing much about it. Because of that, it was inevitable that we would have further COVID outbreaks, unfortunately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government very cruelly cut the JobSeeker payment, as we know. They did the right thing at the beginning. We all in this chamber said they were doing the right thing in terms of doubling the rate of JobSeeker. But in the midst of this pandemic they took that away, in a cut-by-cut process, and then pretended that they had increased JobSeeker. I say 'pretended', because it was $40 a day and now it's just under $44 a day. I challenge anybody on the government benches to try and live on $44 a day. We all know you can't, and the government know that, because they doubled JobSeeker at the beginning of the pandemic. They did the right thing. They knew people couldn't survive on just $40 a day in a lockdown, and they doubled it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I was at a breakfast about women's economic futures. Terese Edwards, the CEO of the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children, very clearly articulated the benefits that that doubling had for families, particularly single-parent families, single mothers. It had a significant positive benefit. And here the government is not taking those same measures but just doing something so that they can say to the public: 'We've increased JobSeeker. Don't you worry about that. We've increased it.' Well, a measly $3 a day does not address the significant poverty that people are living in. In the middle of the pandemic, people are back to trying to survive on a payment on JobSeeker of just $44 a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill gives minimal support and does not go far enough to ensure that people who can't work or have additional costs due to lockdown are adequately supported. It's simply inadequate. It really is just plain cruelty that people on income support are denied access to this disaster payment. There's the low rates and the way it's being imposed—and I will go into more details about that in a minute—but, to add insult to injury, people on income support can't get it. We know very well that people on the JobSeeker payment, youth allowance, DSP and carer payments also lose work during lockdowns and face additional costs to stay safe at home and healthy during lockdowns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also says that if people have some savings, what they call liquid assets, above $10,000 they are not entitled to any payment at all. So if you've been saving for your first home and then you found yourself without any income, through no fault of your own, the federal government says, 'Dip into your home savings and do it potentially indefinitely.' If some people drew down from their super and put it into their savings to try and get through the lockdown, they will get punished for doing something that the government encouraged them to do. In other words, they are having to dip into that to get by when, if they hadn't done that, that money would still be in their super. If they have done this, they're not going to be able to get access to this payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill needs to be fixed. It has a number of flaws. This bill needs to be fixed to ensure that people don't fall through the cracks and to ensure that people aren't left in poverty during these lockdowns. If we had an income support system in this country that gave people enough to live on and didn't condemn them to poverty, we might not have to be in this situation where the government has to make hotspot-by-hotspot refinements. If everybody had, at a minimum, an eligibility for the amount of money that they, in fact, got when JobSeeker was doubled, which the government by its own admissions knows is what Australians need to live above the poverty line, we might not need to be making such special purpose payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's fix our social security system. If the minimum wage were higher and casual work and contracting didn't leave people living hour by hour on the work that they can find, struggling to make ends meet, we might not need to have these sorts of payments quite so much. If people weren't in insecure work, if people didn't have to stitch together several casual and insecure jobs to make ends meet, we might not be in this situation. The government should look beyond asking, 'What is the very least we can do?' They need to look at what has happened as a sign of a huge problem of growing inequality in this country and growing insecure work and look at how we fix it. Instead, we have a piecemeal approach that leaves people anxious and insecure, which has a significant impact on their wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already seen the huge impact that the pandemic has had on people's mental health, wellbeing and anxiety. We have seen a huge increase in the need for mental health supports, for example. Of course the pandemic is having an impact on everyone in this country, but if you literally don't know where your next dollar is coming from it has an even more significant impact on your wellbeing and mental health. We have a huge problem where we have a significant number of people who are literally living pay to pay, week to week. If they miss shifts or if they have to pay for extra services because of lockdowns, they are simply unable to make ends meet. It is critical that people who have lost income through lockdowns have access to adequate support to ensure that they can put food on the table and they can keep a roof over their heads. The criterion set by the government in the middle of Victoria's last lockdown just doesn't do it. It doesn't go far enough. Too many people have been left behind and have just been ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be moving amendments, which I have already circulated in the chamber, to fix this bill and to make it fairer. The Greens amendments will remove eligibility criteria requiring the Chief Medical Officer to declare a location a hotspot; change the eligibility criteria from more than seven days to seven days or more; remove the criteria requiring recipients to have liquid assets of less than $10,000—that's simply unfair to so many people who are saving to try and buy their own home, for example—and remove the criteria preventing people on income support from accessing the payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the Senate to support the Greens amendments so that we can fix this bill and ensure the disaster payment is accessible to more people. This will help ensure that people are not thrown into poverty, or having to dip into their savings for a home, every time there is a lockdown. On Tuesday, we had a debate on the housing crisis in this country. We have people desperately saving for a deposit on their first home, which we know is increasingly hard to do in this country, and the government is saying, 'You use that money when there's a lockdown.' It's not their fault that a lockdown is imposed; it's the fault of the current failures in quarantine and in the vaccine program, but the government says: 'You pay for it out of the deposit you're saving for your first home.' They've struggled to put it together and they're struggling to afford a home, because of the increasingly unaffordable housing market in this country, but the government says, 'You dip into that deposit and you pay for the lockdown.' That is not fair. That is not what I would call a fair Australia. Our amendments will make this bill and the payment fairer, so that fewer people in this country are condemned to poverty and so that the COVID crisis doesn't fuel the poverty crisis in this country. We know that more and more people are falling below the poverty line. Without the Greens amendments to this payment, that will continue to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be supporting Labor's second reading amendment. I ask the chamber to support the Greens amendments in Committee of the Whole to make this bill fair so more Australians are supported and so that we do the best we can for people if they have to go into lockdown—not the least, which is what this bill does.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I rise to speak to the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021. The first part of the bill creates a special appropriation to draw funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the COVID-19 disaster payment. The second part creates a reporting requirement for payments through the special appropriations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I note that this bill would not have been necessary if the government was, in fact, a competent government. The Australian people know too well that this tired, old Morrison government has mishandled the pandemic from the very outset. They have mishandled the rollout of the vaccine and they have mishandled quarantine. To this day, only three per cent of Australians have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The only reason this legislation is before this place is that the Morrison government has failed to bring the pandemic under control. Whether through the vaccine rollout, hotel quarantine or cutting off JobKeeper in an ongoing pandemic, this government has failed Australian workers and it has failed Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen firsthand the ongoing failure of this government in cutting the supplement that was being paid to aged-care workers to prevent them from having to do what too many of them do on a day-to-day basis, and that is work across multiple aged-care homes. I might add that this government has done nothing to raise the remuneration of these frontline, hardworking, committed workers in the aged-care sector, so they gave them a supplement during the pandemic initially so that they wouldn't be forced to work across multiple aged-care homes, to try and assist with containing the pandemic. But they lifted that far too early, and what did they have to do when Victoria went back into lockdown? They had to re-engage and go back to funding that supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian has felt for the Victorian community in so far as they have now had a number of lockdowns. But what we've seen from this government is an allocation of less than $3 for each Victorian who was forced into lockdown. Again, for many Victorian workers and, again, for many businesses, particularly small businesses, that was far too little, far too late. As fellow Australians, those Victorians deserve so much better from this government. Mr Frydenberg has only coughed up a fraction of the $100 million a day that the Treasury secretary warned could be lost because of this lockdown. Victorians shouldn't have to be out of pocket because they had to go into a fourth lockdown; it was not their doing. It is clearly the Morrison government's responsibility to roll out the vaccines in this country—it took them while to admit that that was actually their responsibility, particularly their aged-care minister—and they also have the fundamental responsibility for quarantine, and again they have failed in both of those. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard Mr Morrison say on a number of occasions that the rollout of the vaccine isn't a race. Hello, Mr Morrison? There is not another Australian out there in the community—there might be in part of your party room—who believes that it isn't a race to roll out the vaccine. It is in fact a very important race to get ahead of the pandemic, because the pandemic is on two fronts. The first is the health outcome, and we've seen Australians die. The second is the effect on our economy, on Australian workers, on Australian jobs. Only three per cent of Australians have had both jabs and are fully vaccinated—again a failure by this government to meet its own announcement about when this rollout would be completed and they would be able to vaccinate and keep Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want to return to normality; that's what they want to do. We want visitors coming to my island state of Tasmania. Hotel workers and other people in the hospitality and the tourism sector want to know that they can go back to running their businesses and employ their workers, knowing that there are not going to be any further lockdowns. But to ensure that that happens the government should have from the outset addressed the reality that hotels are built to accommodate people on either business or holiday, as they are everywhere else in the world, but they're not actually built for quarantine in a pandemic as severe as we have now with COVID-19. And now the mutations of that are proving that hotels are in fact the worst place—in inner cities around this country—to house people who are going into quarantine. So this government again has failed to provide, around the country, purpose-built quarantine facilities. We have one such facility, and there has not been one outbreak from that centre. Surely, even the slow learners on that side of the chamber and the slow-learning Prime Minister can see that it is a failure to continue to have quarantine in our cities in hotels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen over the course of this pandemic from those opposite is that they love to come into the chamber and blame the Victorian state government for the quarantine failures. Well, yes, there were learnings. There were learnings in relation to those people who were meant to be providing security. But those lessons around the country have been, overwhelmingly learnt by the state governments. But this government has not learnt the lesson about ensuring that Australians are kept safe while they try to roll out the vaccine—which they have bungled. It's almost like everything these people touch, they stuff. But they haven't learnt the fundamental responsibility that they have, and that is to ensure there's adequate, safe, purpose-built quarantine in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have also seen from this government in a very important sector in this country, one where there are a lot of vulnerable Australians—the aged-care sector—is that they haven't been able to roll out the vaccines for workers in the aged-care sector. Nor have they in the disability sector, and they still don't have a reliable methodology for reporting tangible evidence on how many workers in the aged-care and disability sectors have been fully vaccinated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a proud Tasmanian and I live in the north of the state. I've had things reported back to me from my electorate office this week, and that's happening week by week. This week a gentleman from George Town, a beautiful place on the Tamar River, rang frustrated and concerned because he wants the Pfizer vaccine. He has been, as all Tasmanians have been, urged to get vaccinated, but he's reporting to my office that there is a very slow rollout and people can't access the Pfizer vaccine. That's anecdotal evidence, but it seems to me that, when you have a number of people from the same community making contact with your office, there's got to be something in it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had a lady ring the office this week concerned about the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine. She too wants the Pfizer vaccine. Because this government have failed to get more Australians vaccinated in a timely manner, what we see now is people saying, 'No, I don't want AstraZeneca; I want to wait for Pfizer,' which means the whole herd immunity that we have been trying to encourage Australians to be part of is going to be delayed. We already have an issue with younger members of our community in their 20s, 30s and 40s who don't really want to have the vaccine because they're concerned that the information that's coming out to them gets changed. Even people who have had their first jab of AstraZeneca, which I have had myself, are now questioning whether they should have the second jab. That should be a major concern for this government. What we haven't seen from this government is an effective advertising campaign that is encouraging Australians to get their vaccine, to reassure them that these vaccines, whichever one it is, are safe and give you protection. There may have to be boosters—that's probably likely—like we have with the flu vaccine each year. But the reality is that, no matter where you look, this government keeps failing, at a time when we can ill afford for this government to fail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we have seen too many Australians pass away from COVID-19 over the course of the last 12 months or so. We have learnt those lessons, and, in terms of those people in residential aged care who have been vaccinated, the figures are far better than they were even a month ago. But we have still failed to ensure, for the beneficiaries of home-care packages, that the workers who are going into the homes of those vulnerable older Australians have been fully vaccinated. Again, there is no evidence that this government has any real-time data to give that reassurance to the Australian community. I have a particularly strong concern for older Australians, particularly because I come from Tasmania, where we have the oldest population. The Tasmanian community and its seniors are more vulnerable—but not that much more, I have to say. It probably equates to that of the Northern Territory community and our First Nations people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has brought in this legislation primarily because they have bungled this. As I said earlier, the supplement that was being paid to aged-care workers around this country to ensure that they were not having to work across various homes—which they do because their salaries are not enough for them to provide for their families—should not have been removed until we were through with and had dealt with this pandemic. That would have been the sensible thing to do. The fact that aged-care workers, who are on the front line, can't provide for their families on their salaries is a real disgrace. They are the people who, on a day-to-day basis, give care and support to some of the most vulnerable members of our community. It's a real disgrace in this country. It's a disgrace, because this government did not support them when they were seeking to have their wages increased to enable them to provide for their families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have known for a long time now—since Mr Morrison has been the Prime Minister of this country and the Leader of the Liberal Party—that he is a man who is very loose with the truth. Any commitment that he gives can be taken with a grain of salt. This is a government that is driven by ego. It's a government that is driven by self-interest, and it lacks the compassion and leadership that this country so desperately needs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I too rise to make a contribution to the debate on the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021. The only reason this bill is necessary is that the Morrison government has failed, on many fronts, to bring this pandemic under control, whether it's the vaccine rollout; hotel quarantine; cutting off JobKeeper, particularly to early childhood educators in an ongoing pandemic; the Australians, including children, stuck overseas; the international students not being able to come back to this country; migrant workers; or the Australians with fiances and fiancees on prospective marriage subclass 300 visas. On every single level, the Morrison government has failed in this pandemic. More than that, it steadfastly refuses to speed up the vaccine rollout, and it is completely denying that we need proper quarantine facilities. It had two jobs: rolling out the vaccine and establishing good, safe quarantine. It has failed miserably on both fronts. I think, at the moment, we're up to almost one breakout a week from hotels, which are not quarantine facilities. They are not designed for that purpose. There's a human element to every single step the government fails to take, whether it's children being stuck in India—that's not the only country they're stuck in, but that is disgraceful. Why the government simply can't act to bring those children home is beyond my comprehension. It is not a hard problem to solve and it should certainly be expedited. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to illustrate the damage that can be done when political parties seek to politicise this pandemic, and it's certainly not something that Labor is seeking to do. Earlier in the week the Australian Greens put forward a motion calling for holders of PMV300 visas to be exempt from the inbound travel ban. That was a good motion. Labor supported it. But those of us in this place know that motions have very little effect. They don't have an actionable outcome. What we know on this side is that, in true Greens fashion, the Australian Greens wanted to use this motion as a wedge—particularly, I suspect, against the Labor Party. So there was the usual email campaign, presumably targeted at Labor senators. The Greens had obviously indicated to their supporters that we wouldn't support this motion and that we needed prompting from voters. And, of course, it was an opportunity for Greens to gather email addresses for future propaganda purposes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Greens failed to realise or completely ignored was that with this motion comes the pain being experienced by Australians with loved ones stuck overseas. Yes, sheet the blame home to the Morrison government, but realise what damage your motions do to individuals who think that because I've supported a motion somehow that forces the Morrison government to act. We know in this place it doesn't. I'm really angry about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I had an email from one of those people, a woman who thanked me for supporting the email. It wasn't part of the Greens campaign; she was just grateful that I had supported that email. She said she'd searched everywhere on the internet and in the parliamentary papers to see when the action was going to take place, when her fiance who is stuck overseas as a result of the Morrison government—but rescued, apparently, by a Greens motion—was going to be allowed into this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I went back to her and said that I was extremely upset the Greens would be so short-sighted as to cause her further pain, to raise her hope that somehow the Greens motion in the Senate would result in her fiance being able to come down to this country. I said, 'I'm really sorry you were misled by the Australian Greens.' There's no doubt she was. She came back to me and said, 'I'm really sorry I misunderstood.' I said, 'You did not misunderstand; you were misled by the Australian Greens.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the Greens have done for that woman is cause her further disappointment and pain. They gave her false hope running off the back of this COVID pandemic. The Morrison government is at fault, too, because they failed to act. But, clearly, to politicise this situation in the way the Greens did, to give false hope to people with goodness knows what consequences, is a disgrace.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I rise to speak on the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021 and I want to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague Senator Siewert on this bill. Of course we should be providing support to people who need this, in these devastating circumstances, but, as Senator Siewert said, we should be providing it to every single person who is living here and who is facing economic and social impacts. This government has locked them out of support payments and they're living on the poverty line, and we will be moving amendments to that effect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is good to see that this bill extends COVID disaster payments, we know that this government has completely failed on the vaccine rollout. And, because of this, New South Wales at this moment is on the brink of another lockdown. It's been 15 months since we first went into lockdown and there is still no plan to open our borders. There are hundreds of thousands of families who are separated; there are gut-wrenching stories everywhere. I haven't seen my mum and daughter since 2019. Seeing Prime Minister Morrison gallivanting around the UK while he dodges responsibility for the vaccine rollout and refuses to safely open borders has made the daily pain of not being able to see my family so much worse. When I shared my story of being separated from my mother and daughter for two years now, there was an outpouring of grief and anger. So many people shared with me their painful stories in response. Here are some of the most heartbreaking stories of what turning this country into so-called 'fortress Australia' has done to its people. I do want to share some of them with the senators in the chamber.</span>

My brother and I applied again and wrote to the exemption team that we are desperate to leave Australia as one of us needs to be with our parents. Again rejected. My father contracted COVID and I reapplied and begged the team to allow me to leave Australia and again our exemption was rejected. My father passed away and my mother was in his funeral alone. How can I have my mum in Australia for some time to mourn together and to offer her help and my emotional support? How can I relieve this crippling burden from myself that has taken away my functioning when government doesn't allow family reunification after horrible things that have happened to families during the corona pandemic.</span>

There are thousands upon thousands of families who have not been able to see each other, because this government and the Prime Minister have botched up the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. To Scott Morrison, I say: 'Stop dodging responsibility for the vaccine rollout. Your incompetence is preventing families from reuniting. Try to conjure up even the smallest bit of compassion and start taking seriously this country's vaccine rollout so we can safely open up our borders and families can hug and see each other again.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I thank Senator Faruqi for reading out the accounts of some of the many thousands of Australians who are in that position. There are many people in this building who are in very similar positions. Of course, the debate about this bill occurs as my home state of New South Wales is teetering on the edge of a much broader set of public health responses. Hundreds and hundreds of people are now in isolation, with scores of infections. In the New South Wales parliament itself, a senior minister in the Berejiklian government has a COVID-19 infection. Many ministers and MPs and their staff are now in isolation. I want to send a message of solidarity and support to them, as that parliament works its way through how it should respond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to pay tribute to Chris Minns, the new Labor leader. He saw the responsibility, early and clearly, to act in the public interest, and he has cancelled the budget reply speech, which he was due to deliver today. That was going to be an important moment for Mr Minns to set out his vision for the future of New South Wales, as new Labor leader. It shows that he has his priorities right and the interests of the people of New South Wales in his heart, rather than being concerned with the narrow political interest. I think he is to be commended for taking that approach. In contrast, I don't believe that the Morrison government has ever really grasped its responsibility in this crisis—in public health terms, in economic terms or in social terms. Like Mr Minns, Mr Albanese and federal Labor took a constructive approach to the coronavirus crisis over the course of last year. But all the way through last year you could see that the seeds of the government's failure in 2021 were being sown by the inaction and incapacity of the Morrison government to do the things necessary to put Australia in the right position now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it, 15 months later, that there is no system of quarantine in each of the states and territories that is credible? Why is it that we are still relying upon hotel quarantine, which is a stop-gap solution? Hotels are not hospitals. There have been 24 outbreaks in hotel quarantine. Why is it that, 12 months ago, when representatives of the government met with Pfizer they lost the opportunity to secure sufficient doses to make sure that Australians had a choice of vaccines? In the United States and the United Kingdom, where variously 35 and 45 per cent are vaccinated—and it's north of that in some of the European countries—they have a series of vaccine options. The Morrison government squandered that and bet the house on one product, essentially—AstraZeneca. Pfizer was an afterthought. Now the vaccine rollout is absolutely mired in failure and unable to get past the starting gate. Still just a little bit over three per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve much credit for our progress through the coronavirus pandemic so far. The state governments, businesses and trade unions have been working together to solve problems, looking after each other, but the Morrison government itself has been entirely absent in terms of a position of public leadership. Of course, there is an alternative plan. These kind of stop-gap measures are necessary, but they are necessary because the government hasn't executed its proper responsibility. There is an alternative plan. Anthony Albanese set it out very clearly. </span>

                    </a>  'Albo' to me, Senator Abetz. Firstly, get the vaccine rollout right. Get it right. Get needles into the arms of Australians across the country, make sure that we have a population that is resilient and safe, and execute the vaccine rollout safely and sensibly, like every other country. Why are we 100th in the queue? Why is Australia a global laggard instead of at the front of the queue? Let's get quarantine right, build quarantine in every state and territory and make sure that Australians can return safely. The problems that were outlined earlier this morning can be resolved by getting those two basic Commonwealth responsibilities right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, let's effectively manufacture safe vaccines in Australia, build the relationship with our research facilities and make Australia a leader. Finally, let's get a public health campaign that's actually convincing. This is a Prime Minister who only understands one thing: self-promotion and advertising. That's all he understands. He has not been able to bring his instinct for advertising to advertising for public health for the safety of Australians. Have a look at the French campaign. The French campaign is about opening France up and encouraging French citizens to get vaccinated. There is no Australian equivalent. Why? It's become clear why there isn't a campaign. Despite the Prime Minister's overwhelming instinct for advertising, the reason there isn't a campaign is that it would lay bare the lack of supply of vaccines. The public officials finally told the truth earlier this week. Senator Abetz would have been listening. There will be no public advertising campaign until the government's vaccine supply failures are finally resolved. They know that, if they advertise, people will line up for vaccines, and, when they line up for vaccines, there will be no vaccines available.</span>

                  </a>  Tony Harriott worked for the Australian government for 56½ years, having started in the surveyor department after he left school. He is probably the last of a generation of Comcar drivers that will clock up 50 years, given the casualised contractual arrangements they're now under. He is also celebrating 53 years of marriage to Rosemary, during which time they have together raised a much-loved family of three children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Tony often speaks with much pride and love of his family, and it is definitely time for him to pack up his golf clubs and set off on a few travels with Rosemary and his sister, Janet. To this purpose, we commend him all the very best and thank him for his dedicated and good-humoured service.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sexual harassment is unacceptable in any context, whether in the workplace or elsewhere. Everyone has the right to feel safe at work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why the Australian Government funded the Australian Human Rights Commission to undertake a landmark National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces. The first of its kind in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's response – released on 8 April 2021 – is about creating a new culture of respectful behaviour in Australian workplaces, because the end product of the National Inquiry – the Respect@Work Report – found that too many workplace cultures fall short. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Respect@Work Report made 55 recommendations directed at the Australian Government, states and territories, employers, and industry groups, highlighting the important roles that all groups have in supporting cultural change and creating safe workplaces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has already provided more than $20.5 million over four years in the 2021-22 Federal Budget to support implementation of its response to the Respect@Work Report, outlined in the 'Roadmap for Respect: Preventing and Addressing Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For those recommendations that require action from the state and territory governments, the Australian Government has led discussions through appropriate national forums, including at National Cabinet and the Meeting of Attorneys-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today the Government presents the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Bill 2021</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which implements the Government's legislative commitments under the Roadmap and directly responds to the findings of the Respect@Work Report. These legislative amendments are aimed at rapidly strengthening and streamlining the national legal frameworks that deal with sexual harassment. The Bill makes important changes to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Human Rights Commission Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">1986</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009 </span>to ensure Australia's legal and regulatory frameworks are effective in preventing and responding to sexual harassment. </span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Sex Discrimination Act provides an important framework to protect against discrimination on various grounds, including discrimination involving harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduces a new object in the Sex Discrimination Act of achieving equality of opportunity between men and women. While achieving substantive equality between men and women requires a cultural change that goes beyond legislative reform, the Government is confident that this Bill, in addition to the other work that the Government and civil society is progressing to implement the Roadmap, will be a step towards achieving equality of opportunity between men and women in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes a number of changes to expand the scope of existing protections under the Sex Discrimination Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These include amendments to remove the exemption of state and territory public servants, and clarify that the Sex Discrimination Act extends to Members of Parliament and Judges at the federal and state and territory levels, to ensure all workers have the same protections from sex discrimination and sexual harassment regardless of their jurisdiction, occupation or workplace. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes clear that discrimination involving harassment on the ground of sex is expressly prohibited and will not be tolerated. Making this clear under the Sex Discrimination Act will ensure there is a clear avenue of redress for sex based harassment, that does not involve sexualised conduct but is also unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Bill fills gaps in the Sex Discrimination Act's current coverage of types of workers in an employment context. The Respect@Work Report identified that the sexual harassment protections do not cover all persons in the contemporary world of work. The Bill will fill these gaps by expanding the scope of the sexual harassment and sex-based harassment protections to all types of paid and unpaid workers. The amendments draw on concepts used in the model Work Health and Safety laws to ensure greater consistency between legal frameworks that address sexual harassment, making it easier for workers and employers to navigate these frameworks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes a number of technical amendments, such as clarifying that the victimisation offence in the Sex Discrimination Act can form the basis of a civil action for unlawful discrimination, and ensuring that the ancillary liability of persons involved in unlawful acts extends to sexual and sex-based harassment prohibitions under the Sex Discrimination Act. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure complainants are encouraged to come forward when unlawful discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act does occur, the Bill will amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act to reduce procedural barriers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will amend the President's discretion to terminate a complaint under the Sex Discrimination Act on the grounds of time so that it does not arise until 24 months after the alleged discrimination took place. This discretion previously arose after six months. </span>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act and Australian Human Rights Commission Act, the Bill will amend the Fair Work Act to clarify what action can be taken to deal with workplace sexual harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill adds a new legislative note in the unfair dismissal provisions in the Fair Work Act, which makes clear that sexual harassment can constitute a valid reason for dismissal. This is not a change to the law – sexual harassment of course can already constitute a valid reason for dismissal. However, the addition of the legislative note will provide greater certainty to employers that taking disciplinary action in response to workplace sexual harassment is appropriate and reasonable. It also clearly communicates to perpetrators of sexual harassment that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also clarify and expressly provide for the availability of 'stop orders' in relation to sexual harassment within the existing stop-bullying jurisdiction. This change will ensure a clear pathway for those who have been sexually harassed at work to seek an order from the Fair Work Commission to prevent further workplace sexual harassment. This will enable more sexual harassment victims to pursue workplace claims through the Commission, which offers an independent, expeditious and low cost avenue for handling workplace sexual harassment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments form an integral part of the Government's long term commitment to building a culture of safe, respectful relationships in Australian workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also introduces an important change to the compassionate leave provisions in the Fair Work Act that will enable an employee to take compassionate leave if they, or their spouse or de facto partner, has a miscarriage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A miscarriage can be an incredibly difficult experience for many families and sadly one that is often surrounded with social stigma and silence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is estimated that one in five confirmed pregnancies in Australia ends in miscarriage before 20 weeks, however the Fair Work Act does not currently provide any specific leave entitlements for miscarriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, the Fair Work Act provides two days' paid compassionate leave (unpaid for casuals) when a member of the employee's immediate family or household contracts or develops a personal illness, or sustains a personal injury, that poses a serious threat to their life, or dies. Compassionate leave is also available where a child is stillborn, where the child would have been a member of the employee's immediate family, or a member of the employee's household, if the child had been born alive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This change will ensure that an employee can take time away from work to grieve and come to terms with their loss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that most employers are supportive of their employees. Employers can of course continue to offer leave that goes beyond the minimum safety net and employees will continue to have the benefit of any additional related leave terms in existing enterprise agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While not everyone who experiences a miscarriage will want to access compassionate leave, it is important that we give employees the choice to access that leave, should they choose to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On behalf of the government, I would like to thank all of those who have shared their experiences and incredibly painful memories to bring these changes to Parliament, including the Pink Elephants Support Network and Mr Julian Simmonds MP, Member for Ryan who has championed this amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, this Bill will ensure all Australians are protected from workplace sexual harassment, by expanding the scope of existing sexual harassment prohibitions, promoting clarity for employers and workers, and reducing procedural barriers for sexual harassment complainants. </span>

                  </a>  What's happened here is that last night a bill was rammed through the House, and the government, in the House, sought leave to move amendments (1) to (502) together and then forced the House to vote on it shortly thereafter. This is an unprecedented move to not only ram through a bill in breach of the cut-off order but also ram through a bill that has been so extensively amended without anyone having the time to properly read those amendments. There were 46 pages of amendments—502 amendments in total. This is an absolute farce. You cannot ram this bill through the Senate with such extensive amendments. That is why we are seeking to remove this bill from the motion, so that it can have the proper scrutiny and consideration that is warranted for a bill that vastly increases the state surveillance powers of this totalitarian government.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation will support this motion. Hemp is a variety of cannabis that does not contain high levels of the psychoactive compound called THC, also referred to as marijuana. The war on THC has caused hemp to be stigmatised without reason. Hemp is a modern commercial crop for use in paper, fabrics, natural pharmaceuticals, and, as Senator Whish-Wilson pointed out, in food. What I would like to add to the debate is to point out that hemp is a fast-growing crop, which makes it suitable for opportunistic planting after rain. Used in rotation with grain crops, hemp can condition the soil and improve yields across the planting cycle. Hemp is deeply rooted, which remediates soil and provides a crop to stabilise and protect topsoil in areas where erosion can be a problem. Hemp is being trialled as a forage crop in Tassie. Those are going to be healthy, happy cows. I urge all Australian farmers to take another look at hemp and join a world market expected to be valued at about $50 billion by 2026.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  At this point, Senator Waters, I am not going to put that question to the Senate. Pursuant to my ruling the other day with respect to standing order 86(1), this matter has been considered by the Senate twice in the last week in two separate circumstances—one upon its introduction. I ruled the other day that, following its introduction, it was to be published, which gave senators the opportunity to see the bill. My ruling was that was a different circumstance. This is the same motion as appeared the other day, where the first reading was denied by the Senate, and I believe that is covered by standing order 86(1), which I'm happy to read out again if necessary but I'm conscious we are limited for time. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  That motion is entirely within order. I will put the motion moved by Senator Waters because that would suspend standing order 86(1); and, therefore, the ruling would no longer be relevant. Standing order 86(1) is the standing order that you can't put the same question. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A question shall not be proposed if it is the same in substance as any question which has been determined during the same session, unless the order, resolution, or vote on such question was determined more than 6 months previously or has been rescinded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think my ruling is quite clear. Senator Waters is taking the appropriate response, which is to move to suspend that standing order to allow reconsideration of the bill. </span>

                  </a>  Mr President, this is a difficult one for us in the sense that we acknowledge and support your ruling on the matter but we have voted consistently with the Greens to allow for this legislation to be introduced. That doesn't indicate our position on the bill but we believe, Senator Waters, that you do have the right to introduce legislation and we have supported you throughout. But in light of the fact that you have made a ruling, Mr President, it is important for us to indicate our support for your ruling, acknowledging that our preference would have been that Senator Waters would and should have been allowed to introduce her legislation in accordance with the convention of this place several times this week.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  I appreciate the expression of support. I should clarify. I wouldn't consider this to be a dissent from my ruling at all. This is not a matter of supporting my ruling or otherwise; this is the appropriate mechanism to suspend the standing order upon which I am basing my ruling. So this is not the same as moving a dissent in the chair's ruling at all. It's merely saying this rule shouldn't apply for this matter, and that is entirely appropriate for consideration by the Senate. But it is dealt with without debate under the provisions we have adopted. So I appreciate the support but I wouldn't take it as a dissent from my ruling, if this motion was supported. </span>

                  </a>  Mr President, I would like some clarification. This has been raised a few times in the chamber now. You have made a ruling on it, under what it states in the standing orders. Is this going to happen every time? In the next sitting of parliament, are we going to have the same pieces of legislation get up? Is it going to be the same again—that we are voting on standing orders, overruling what is in 86? Is this going to come on every time, every day in this chamber?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  That is an interesting question. There have been previous rulings from the chair, both from myself and my predecessor, that repeated attempts to suspend standing orders are out of the order. We have dealt with that on Thursdays, when we have been dealing with lots of legislation at once. This is not a repeated attempt; this is the first attempt to suspend the standing order that prevents the Senate considering this discussion. That's why it's not a dissent from my ruling, and I wouldn't view it as such. The Senate is always capable of suspending its own standing orders to deal with a matter it considers should be dealt with separately. However, if the Senate did vote to not suspend standing orders here, repeated attempts—and I wouldn't say it would only be a second attempt when we resume in August—would be out of order if, every day, there was an attempt to suspend standing orders to deal with the first reading of this bill. But it does need to be repeated attempts. My recollection is that, after two or three attempts, the Senate or the chair has determined that there have been multiple attempts to suspend standing orders to deal with the matter that way and we will not entertain any further measures. I hope that answers your question, Senator Hanson. </span>

                  </a>  The Morrison government has immediately supported 25 of the 38 recommendations of the second year review and commends the work of the independent reviewer. Notably, the review did not recommend an increase to the maximum redress payment. To implement the immediate recommendations, we have committed $80 million to improve the survivor experience and the redress scheme process, including advance payments of $10,000 to specific cohorts. Any major design changes of the scheme's legislation in response to the review would require the approval of the scheme's governance arrangements with state and territory redress ministers. This includes the remaining 13 recommendations, which are noted or supported in principle due to this requirement. I am working actively with the states and territories to seek their support to amend the legislation which underpins the scheme. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Forced Labour) Bill 2021 is to ban absolutely the importation of goods that are produced in whole or part by forced labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Parliament has expressed strong support for international efforts to suppress modern slavery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Estimates of the number of slaves across the world range from around 38 million to 46 million and the use of forced labour within global production chains has emerged as a major humanitarian concern. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The issue of modern slavery has also been highlighted by the well documented human rights abuse of hundreds of thousands of Uyghur people in Xinjiang Province in China. The massive and systematic oppression of the Uyghur people by the Chinese Government is undeniable. The exploitation of detained Uyghurs as a captive labour force is clear. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The need to address this pressing problem caused me to introduce the Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Uyghur Forced Labour) Bill 2020 on 8 December 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of that Bill was to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901</span> to ban the importation of goods produced or manufactured in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China and goods produced or manufactured in the People's Republic of China through the use of forced labour within the meaning of the Criminal Code. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That Bill was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee chaired by Senator Abetz with Senator Kitching as Deputy Chair. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Abetz and Senator Kitching and all the other members of the Committee for their work on that inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also wish to thank the many people and organisations that made submissions and gave evidence to the inquiry, especially members of the Australian Uyghur community who face harassment from Chinese Government officials here in Australia and grave threats to family members, relatives and friends in Xinjiang.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee reported to the Senate on 17 June 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee endorsed without reservation the objectives of my Bill and went on to observe that: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The state-sponsored forced labour to which the Uyghur people are being subjected by the Chinese dictatorship is a grave human rights violation. It is incumbent on the government to take steps to ensure that Australian businesses and consumers are not in any way complicit in these egregious abuses."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In considering the Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Uyghur Forced Labour) Bill 2020 in the wider context of modern slavery, the Committee further took the view that it would be preferable to introduce a global ban on the import to Australia of goods produced by forced labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee accordingly recommended that "the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901</span> and/or other relevant legislation be amended to prohibit the import of any goods made wholly or in part with forced labour, regardless of geographic origin" (Recommendation 1). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have expressed my support for this recommendation, and for the other recommendations relating to government policy, administrative and enforcement matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My concern has always been that action be taken quickly to ensure that Australia's condemnation of the Chinese Government's shameful persecution and exploitation of the Uyghur people is made absolutely clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee's report is an important step forward, but legislative implementation must not be delayed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Chinese Communist Party's oppression of the Uyghur people is an immediate and continuing affront to human decency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It requires an immediate response from the Australian Parliament, not the usual protracted process of government review that may lead to legislative and administrative action in two or three years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The need for prompt action is underlined by reports last week that the Victorian state government has turned a blind eye to the use of forced Uyghur labour by the Chinese state-owned company KTK Group, which supplies components for the construction of Victoria's metro railway system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In these circumstances, the Australian Parliament should move without delay to implement the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's primary recommendation without delay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly, rather than amend the original Bill, I am pleased to introduce a new Bill to implement the Committee's proposed global ban on the importation of goods produced through forced labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Forced Labour) Bill 2021 will amend to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901</span> to impose an absolute ban on the importation of goods produced in whole or part by forced labour. The proposed ban is global in nature and does not specify any geographic origin for its application. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The use of forced labour is defined in the Bill by reference to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The importation into Australia of any goods found to have been produced by forced labour will be subject to the penalties that apply to the importation of other goods designated as prohibited imports by regulations made under the Customs Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill supports Australia's longstanding commitment to internationally recognised human rights to freedom from slavery and forced labour such as in Article 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and related international conventions against slavery and forced labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising the need for urgent action to address a grave humanitarian problem, the Bill is introduced with the objective of implementing Recommendation 1 of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's report without delay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If Australia is to be true to the democratic values we hold, we need to leave the Chinese Government in no doubt that its conduct is unconscionable and unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will achieve that objective through the imposition of an absolute prohibition on the importation of goods produced by forced labour, of which, as the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee noted, cotton sourced from Xinjiang is the first, obvious target for enforcement attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It would be a grave failure on the part of the Australian Parliament if we do not call out and take action to limit the massive abuses of human rights by the Chinese Communist regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  Labor will be supporting the Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021 bill. As outlined in the EM, the purpose of the bill is to 'waive the repayment of certain classes of debt in relation to the Farm Household Allowance Program, through amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 2014'. It states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The FHA program provides time-limited, means-tested income support to farmers and their partners experiencing financial hardship. Farmers are eligible for the FHA for a maximum of 4 years (recorded as a 1,460 day clock) in every 10 year period (beginning 1 July 2014). The days do not need to be consecutive and can be taken only if, and when needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Previously, FHA recipients' income estimate was reconciled annually through a process called business income reconciliation (BIR).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The BIR determined whether a recipient received a 'top up' payment, no adjustment or incurred a debt. The BIR was removed from the FHS Act with effect from 1 July 2020 as part of a process to simplify the FHA following a 2018 independent review. While the BIR was removed in 2020, some FHA recipients incurred debts from this process between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2020 or have not yet been assessed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill would permanently waive the repayment of certain classes of debts for FHA recipients arising from the BIR process for FHA payments between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would assist farmers suffering financial hardship and eliminate the negative effects of the business income reconciliation process. The EM states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To enhance fairness it would ensure that an FHA recipient who already has a BIR debt does not also receive the double benefit of having their clock re-credited if they choose to have their debt waived.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill would also provide an end date of 30 June 2023 for FHA recipients to supply their full financial statements for the BIR process.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to put on record the challenges facing farmers in regional communities. The Morrison government's inaction on many of these issues is very concerning. They are big on announcement, but unfortunately there is not a lot on delivery. Last week we had another big announcement, the agriculture workers visa, but not a lot of detail on the delivery. This latest announcement comes three years after the Nationals first said there would be an agriculture visa, so farmers won't be holding their breath for action soon. With Morrison's faltering vaccine rollout and quarantine failures set to keep borders closed for the foreseeable future, it's difficult to see how any new visa will fix the labour shortages crippling Australia's farmers now. The Morrison government must come clean with more details. Any proposed visa cannot mean more shocking exploitation of workers on farms. The Morrison government has a terrible track record on fixing workforce shortages on Australian farms. Mr Morrison is still yet to respond to the recommendations of the National Agriculture Workforce Strategy that were handed to the government in October. Producers have already faced losses of more than $50 million from rotting crops due to workforce shortages on farms. The Morrison government has failed to take responsibility for labour shortages. Farmers just want this fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is also dragging its feet on the challenges farmers face around biosecurity. Further reducing confidence was the recent publication of the Australian National Audit Office audit report on biosecurity. The findings of the ANAO report are scathing and extremely concerning. The ANAO concludes that the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment's arrangements to respond to noncompliance with biosecurity requirements are largely inappropriate. Clearly we do not have a fit-for-purpose biosecurity system. What does this say about the Morrison government's interest in biosecurity risk? The ANAO's findings in relation to the inadequacy of Australia's biosecurity system must be taken seriously. A biosecurity system that is deemed to be inappropriately managed has massive implications for the agriculture sector and it puts Australian farmers in a very vulnerable position, which is totally unacceptable. Incursions of pests and disease are of great concern to farmers, who know the significant risks if and when Australia's biosecurity system fails them. The Morrison government must do better for the agriculture sector when it comes to Australia's biosecurity system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of bushfires, drought, the COVID-19 pandemic and the workforce shortage, we know another crisis that farmers in regional communities have had to face, and that's the mouse plague. The mouse plague is now impacting across multiple states. Is there a national response from the Morrison government? No, there is no national response. Labor's call for a national response plan has been ignored. The New South Wales agriculture minister also wrote to the Morrison government asking it to provide assistance with the mouse plague. The New South Wales minister's request for a national response plan has been ignored. Labor is concerned about the impact the plague is having and will continue to have across Australian farms. NSW Farmers have estimated that the plague has already cost $1 billion in lost winter crops. The Morrison government must do better to help farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing: we will keep a close eye on how the Morrison government continues to manage its changes in this legislation and the other concerns I've raised today.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  Last week the Federal Court backed the people who were affected by robodebts. It handed down its judgement on the robodebt class action that found that the Commonwealth unlawfully raised $1.7 billion in debts against 443,000 people. In his judgement, Justice Murphy criticised the federal government's massive failure and said that the court heard 'heart-wrenching' stories of pain and anguish from victims of the Centrelink debt recovery program. Justice Murphy said it should have been obvious to government ministers and senior public servants that the debt-raising method central to the system was flawed. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proceeding has exposed a shameful chapter in the administration of the Commonwealth social security system and a massive failure of public administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021, which we are dealing with today, will waive the Farm Household Allowance debts of 5,300 farmers and their partners. It will waive $51 million in income support debts. I will say right now that the Greens think that farmers and people in regional areas should be supported by the government and that these debts should be waived. However, the point I'm making is that the stark contrast between the way people on other income support payments were treated through the disgusting robodebt disaster and the appropriate way that people with debts through the Farm Household Allowance are now being treated should be blindingly obvious to anyone. The difference between the ways the two groups have been handled is startlingly obvious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we support those people with Farm Household Allowance debts. We support this bill. The government argues that the waiver is appropriate for farmers because they were acting in 'good faith'. If only the government gave other people on income support even some of that benefit of the doubt. It's truly outrageous when you compare the different approaches. When it came to robodebt, income support recipients were assumed guilty, simply for being on income support. There was none of this government's presumption-of-innocence approach. The government pursued people for debts they did not owe when the government should have known—if they didn't know—that it was illegal. Now the government doesn't want to hand over the documents, the evidence, that tell the community when and what they knew, and who knew.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is almost impossible to account for the social and economic costs of the government's punitive robodebt program. This program has caused so much pain and distress to so many for so long. The government knew this and continued it anyway, treating people appallingly. This program literally cost people's lives, it ruined many others and it caused so much pain and anguish. This is a shameful chapter in our history. People should not be treated this way. I'm glad the government has seen the light, and I encourage them to apply it to everybody who is on income support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly highlight a few points from the second reading speech of Minister Michael Sukkar from the other place, because it's very obvious when you read the minister's speech and he goes on to explain why farmers are having their debts waived, why they need the relief. He says that, 'Farming income is volatile.' I know there are senators in this chamber who are from farming families, and, as I said yesterday, my father was a farmer and, indeed, I've been a farmer myself. So I appreciate that farming income is volatile. I also appreciate what the minister said—that, based on uncertain yields and prices and unpredictable weather, farmers have to make difficult predictions about their income for the year ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to underline that bit about unpredictable weather. There has been a big debate this week about climate change being one of the key risks that Australian farmers face. The Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021 is a recognition of that. This bill is designed primarily to help farmers who have dealt with drought and with floods. The minister said that in the second last paragraph of his second reading speech. Summing up, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Underline 'recover from drought, bushfires and floods. He also mentioned the global pandemic that they've experienced over recent years. There you have it in a nutshell: farmers suffering from drought, bushfires and floods. Could you be any more circumspect about the risks that are facing our farming community? Every farmer knows that the weather and climate are one of the most variable factors that they face in trying to make a living, a sustainable livelihood, working the land to feed the nation, to grow a whole range of different products.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in this place a National Party that purports to represent farmers, that has as its new leader an individual, Mr Barnaby Joyce, who openly denies climate change, and others in this chamber, like Senator Canavan, who also are openly on record dismissing the need for climate action. It's no secret that the National Party is hijacking this government, preventing it from putting in place even weak 2050 targets, when all of us who understand climate change, based on the best available science—the whole world knows this—know that we need strong 2030 targets. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish on that point. Without climate action there will be significant costs and risks to farmers. Farmers understand that, and they deserve better. They deserve their representatives in regional areas to take up their case in this place and to take the strongest possible action on climate. The Greens will do that. The Greens will always take the strongest possible action on climate because we understand that doing nothing risks everything. We are going to see a lot more of that in this country in the future if we don't take the necessary climate action on behalf of farmers and, indeed, all our communities across this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 4) Bill 2021. There are six Treasury measures in this bill, a number of schedules implementing budget measures from the last two budgets. The most substantial measure is the one-year extension of the low- and middle-income tax offset for the 2021-22 financial year, in schedule 6, at a cost of $7.8 billion. The offset provides a tax offset of up to $1,080 for individuals with low-to-middle incomes. At a time when the nation is experiencing a global pandemic and the related effect on the economy, this will be a welcome benefit to individuals and families who have been stretched over the past year. This is only a temporary measure though. We know that there are Australians who are struggling. Labor supports this measure because it puts more money into the pockets of Aussies doing it tough. Tax relief for low- and middle-income Australians is not only fairer but also more effective than tax relief for high-income earners, because of their higher propensity to spend. Simply put: recipients use the funds to secure the extras they need—from groceries to household goods, to clothing and to much-needed repairs—which helps stimulate the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time as this temporary measure for an estimated 10.2 million taxpayers who will benefit from the extension of the offset, this government persists with the permanent tax cut for some of Australia's highest income earners. Labor knows that when it comes to tax relief in the budget, priorities should be given to those who need it most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 implements the 2020-21 budget measure to provide a targeted exemption for granny flats from CGT events that occur on entering into, varying or terminating formal written arrangements under which an older person or a person with a disability acquires, varies or disposes of a granny flat interest. The creation of a formal arrangement that could incur capital gains tax consequences has meant that families have preferred informal agreements regarding granny flat property or dwelling-sharing arrangements. This measure seeks to avoid the capital gains tax events occurring with formal written arrangements when an older person or a person with a disability acquires, varies or disposes of a granny flat interest. This change goes some way to reducing the risk of exploitation for older and vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other schedules in the bill cover a fringe benefits tax exemption to support retraining and reskilling at a cost of $9 million over the forward estimates; the extension of the operation of the junior minerals exploration incentive for a further four years from 2021-22 at a cost of $39 million over the forward estimates; amendments to the way ASIC and the product intervention regime works to address unintended outcomes; and ensuring that the unique circumstances of COVID-19, where New Zealand sports team and staff may have to spend more time than usual in Australia, do not have an adverse tax impact with regard to determining whether income derived in such competitions is taxable in Australia. Although the bill extends the low- and middle-income tax offset, it makes sense to consider the wider context of this bill. As my colleague the member for Rankin said in the other place, the Morrison government is one of the two highest taxing governments of the last three decades, with the Howard government being the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID is the pandemic that, of course, none of us wanted, but, in it, we have an opportunity to reassess the way we have done things in the past. It is a chance to build back better. The government so far has failed to take this opportunity. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I rise to speak about the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021. The government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support workers with these payments in the latest round of the COVID crisis. Casual workers in Victoria were left waiting in the last outbreak, without income and without support, until the federal government finally delivered this payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has form when it comes to leaving casual workers behind. During the pandemic, Prime Minister Morrison was pushed into a nationwide wage subsidy for Australian workers and businesses, and who did he choose to exclude? He chose to exclude thousands of casual workers, gig workers, arts and entertainment workers and more—workers in some of the hardest hit and most insecure industries. At the same time, while this government was leaving vulnerable casual workers behind, big and profitable businesses like Harvey Norman were able to pocket the JobKeeper payments, and they still don't have to repay the millions of dollars the government handed out to them. It is an absolute disgrace that the government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to this much-needed disaster payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also has form on excluding and punishing insecure workers. After excluding so many insecure workers from JobKeeper payments, the Prime Minister told those workers to smash open their piggy banks and raid their own super to get through the pandemic. Instead of sharing the burden equally amongst Australians, instead of helping all Australians, the Prime Minister chose to tell some of our most vulnerable people, our most insecure workers, that they needed to fund their own pandemic support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no surprise, then, that when these latest COVID outbreaks happened the government took its time to support casual workers again. This government has shown absolutely no urgency during this crisis. According to the Prime Minister, on financial support for casual workers after the early end of JobKeeper—what's the hurry? The vaccine rollout—well, apparently the Prime Minister thinks it's not a race. Purpose-built quarantine facilities—well, they can wait, too. But our doors are open, according to the Prime Minister, if the states want to take responsibility for quarantine. If the states want to come up with proposals for purpose-built, open-air quarantine, the government is willing to hear those proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, what a slow and heartless response to this COVID crisis from this government. This government should be absolutely embarrassed about the bungled vaccine rollout. They should be ashamed at the pace of the vaccine rollout in this country. Australians entered 2021 expecting a fast and efficient vaccine rollout from their government, only to be given the opposite by this federal government. I was there last winter with Victorians as we faced a winter with the virus spreading throughout our community. Really, back then, one of the only things that gave us hope was that the federal government would get itself together and be able to do a fast, efficient and effective vaccine rollout once we got through the COVID outbreaks of winter—that they would do that in 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And here we are again. This time, this winter, it's not Victoria facing the crisis; it's not Victoria in imminent crisis. This time it's New South Wales, facing another winter with this virus yet again trying to spread its way through the community—a community that, because of the failings of this government, is almost entirely unvaccinated. Today only three per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated. This government should be embarrassed. They should be ashamed. We are currently millions of doses behind the government's own vaccination targets—not their first target, which got passed, and not their second target, which they threw out, but their third target. This government just keeps dropping the bar lower and lower and still missing the mark on their vaccination targets. And still, even this week, they cannot tell us when all aged-care workers will be vaccinated. They can't tell us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's vaccine strategy is a complete and utter shambles. One day they're telling over-50s to go and get the AstraZeneca vaccine. The next day they're saying people can wait for a Pfizer vaccine, until the end of they year, if they're not comfortable getting AstraZeneca. Now we know AstraZeneca is safe only for those aged over 60 years. This is all because the government decided to put all its eggs in the AstraZeneca basket. This government has messed up this vaccine rollout from day one. They should have done what the experts recommended. They should have done what Labor called for, and that was to source multiple vaccine contracts right from the start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is Australians who are suffering because of the incompetence and bad decisions of this government. It is Australians who are suffering because of the tragic decisions of this government. Australians had to dig deep to get through the last year. They have sacrificed so much to try to beat this virus, and they should have been able to come into this year with the confidence that the Australian government had their back, that the Australian government was going to roll this vaccine out comprehensively and effectively. They have done the exact opposite. Australians should have been able to come into 2021 and see, in the middle of the year, a real plan that ensured that they would be able to beat this virus and would be safe—that people wouldn't just be going about their daily lives waiting for the next COVID outbreak to hit their community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People of Australia should have been able to hope that we would all be vaccinated, that quarantine would now be safe. But this Morrison government has failed on both counts. They have failed Australians. They have had months and months to effectively roll out this vaccine. They have had months to get safe, national, open-air quarantine facilities up and running. Have they done either? No, they have not. Throughout this pandemic, the Morrison government has denied its responsibility for quarantine. It has failed to set up appropriate national standards for quarantine. All the while, they sit back and they critique what the state governments are doing. They critique state government responses to breaches in hotel quarantine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody knows that hotels are not fit for purpose, that hotel quarantine was okay at the start of this pandemic but, 18 months on, is a complete failure. The Prime Minister, though, doesn't see it that way. He said on hotel quarantine back in April: 'This is a system that is achieving 99.99 per cent effectiveness. It's a very strong system and serving Australia very well.' Well, 24 breaches later and it is difficult to take those statements from the Prime Minister seriously. It is difficult to take those statements as anything other than a complete abrogation of this federal government's responsibility for controlling this virus and for establishing safe and effective open-air, purpose-built quarantine facilities. With tens of thousands of infections in Australia and more than 800 tragic deaths last year, that is not a quarantine system that is serving Australians well. It is a system that is struggling to keep up. When, Australians are asking themselves, will the Morrison government get it that hotels are built for tourists, that hotels are built for short stays? Hotels are not built for virus control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government was told this way back in October. They were told by their own hand-picked adviser Jane Halton that they needed to build fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities. This was months ago. The Victorian government handed them a proposal for a new purpose-built quarantine facility back in April. It took the Victorian government to take on the federal responsibility of setting up safe and effective quarantine and come up with a proposal, which they presented to the federal government back in April. When did the Prime Minister finally agree to build a facility in Victoria? It was in June. This was a completely reactive decision. This was in June while Victoria was battling with new COVID outbreaks due to yet another failure in the hotel quarantine system—this time, a leak from the South Australian hotel quarantine system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government just doesn't think ahead. They are completely reactive. They don't plan. When they are finally dragged, kicking and screaming, to act, too often it is already too late. It is impossible for a federal government to deal with a pandemic if they have the attitude of this Morrison government. This is a government that does not believe in proactively taking charge of this emergency situation. They don't even believe that they have a responsibility for federal quarantine. If they do believe that they have responsibility for the vaccine rollout, they are showing absolutely no urgency in getting it done whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the problem with this Morrison government is that it is impossible to deal with a pandemic if you don't actually believe in taking responsibility, if you don't actually believe that it is the role of government, of your government, to keep people safe. It will be impossible for the Morrison government to deal effectively with this pandemic if they don't even believe in governing in the best interests of Australians at all. It will be impossible to deal with this pandemic effectively if the government's strategy is to wait to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to do anything. It just won't work. As a result of this government's failure on vaccines, failure on quarantine and failure to take responsibility, Australians are now exposed. It doesn't have to be this way at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If only this government believed in taking responsibility. If only they believed in governing in the best interests of all Australians. If only they would act ahead of time, instead of reacting when it's already too late. Until this government does act, all of the hard work that Australians put in to get our country moving again is just waiting to be thrown away. It is Australians who have sacrificed so much. It is Australians who have done all of the work to defeat this virus. Unless this government starts to be proactive, unless it starts to put in place systems that keep people safe, all of the hard work that Australians have done—all of it—is going to be squandered over the course of 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that if we are to beat this virus and keep Australians safe there can be no more delays of the type that this Morrison government engages in. It is Labor that would build dedicated quarantine facilities in every single state and territory. Labor would fix this bungled vaccine rollout. Labor would start a mass public health campaign around vaccines. Where is the public health campaign around vaccines in this country, today, under the Morrison government? Labor would make it a first priority to manufacture new vaccines right here, and it is Labor's plan that is the only pathway to a real recovery that leaves Australians secure in getting on with their lives. That is the kind of leadership that Australians need. That is the kind of responsibility that Australians need. The Morrison government is offering the opposite.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I rise to speak on the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021. The amount of money this government has spent in response to the pandemic is truly breathtaking. It boggles the mind: more than $300 billion. It's very clear that successive Australian governments never anticipated such an event and certainly never had any kind of practical response planned. We wouldn't be in this situation otherwise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking about generations of more debt, locking in welfare dependency, massive buckets of money thrown at big businesses that didn't need anywhere near as much as they received, and workers receiving subsidised wages beyond what they were actually earning. The government had no problem chasing debts by hounding welfare recipients prior to this pandemic, but there appears to be no comprehensive plan to recover a lot of money wasted in the pandemic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're dooming generations of Australians to paying for these mistakes in the future. We may be a trillion dollars in the red in a few short years. We may be able to lessen this burden on our children and their children if the government forensically examine where this avalanche of funds has gone, where much of it wasn't needed, and move to recover it. This response was not thought out. It was rushed, and expensive mistakes have been made. I've heard from businesses that have received thousands of taxpayer dollars despite telling the government the money was no longer required. Some companies claiming JobKeeper have improved their earnings during the pandemic and continued to pay big dividends and executive bonuses, and all they've risked is their reputations. Why? Because JobKeeper is based on a company's revenue and not on whether the company actually needed it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This economic response has been heavily rorted. It's been a scammer's paradise. In March, the Australian Taxation Office said it was still owed hundreds of millions of dollars from companies that rorted JobKeeper, even from companies that had agreed to hand back money to taxpayers. At the time, the ATO said it had recovered about $135 million, with only some of this money related to deliberate defrauding of JobKeeper. Shockingly, the ATO agreed not to recover about $50 million from about 12,000 businesses who had made honest mistakes. Some businesses claimed wages for employees who did not exist, in order to qualify for a taxpayer boost to their cash flow. The ATO said only one large company had been referred for potential prosecution and only a handful of others were being considered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As early as August last year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission confirmed to a parliamentary committee it had received COVID-19 scam referrals from nine different agencies. It noted property crime, government program fraud, identity theft linked to the stimulus, suspicious international payments and money transfers, fraudulent websites providing misleading information, unlicensed advice about JobKeeper and fraudulent claims for small business support. It also flagged concerns about the early release of superannuation, such as real estate agents encouraging tenants to use it to pay rent, credit providers advising it be used to pay off loans or fund house deposits and people being charged fees to access it. This may be only the tip of the iceberg. When the government is writing blank cheques, everyone wants a piece of the action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister may say the economy can't run on government handouts forever, but we'll be paying for the response forever. In any case, the economy has been too dependent on massive government spending for too long. Australians long for a government that will get back to what it's supposed to do: govern fairly, justly and efficiently. This pandemic has instead given governments the green light to do what they couldn't do before: exert a level of control over Australian citizens not seen since the Second World War. And it's going to allow successive Australian governments to shift blame for their fiscal failures onto the pandemic for a very long time. It's inevitable. But if we get serious about investigating, auditing and recovering as much of the wasted money as possible, we can reduce the burden on future generations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been talk about the vaccines. We hear from Labor, especially, that the vaccine rollout hasn't happened. The last speaker said, 'Labor would put in new vaccinations that are made here.' New vaccinations? Can I tell people that the TGA usually takes seven years for any vaccination to be trialled. We've got vaccinations with Pfizer and AstraZeneca that are only 10 months old, and we're encouraging people to take the vaccination. But new vaccines? Oh, it's alright. Just line people up and jab them. We don't even know the long-term effects of this. The TGA report on 27 May of this year stated that following immunisation there have been 210 deaths: 109 from Pfizer, a further 94 from AstraZeneca, and seven from unspecified vaccinations. This was in the TGA report—'Following immunisation, these deaths occurred.' We rely on the TGA and their recommendations, and they've backed these vaccinations. I remember when it first came out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They may complain about Scott Morrison and how he's handled this. They may say that it's a federal issue and he hasn't handled it properly. Well, I'll tell you something. When I look at how the premiers of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia have handled this, it's absolutely ridiculous: at the drop of a hat, they close their borders and shut people down in their own states. If that's how the Labor premiers have handled it—hotel quarantine in Victoria was a rabble. That's where it all started. That's where the deaths happened in Victoria. It wasn't under the Prime Minister's watch; it was under Labor and the way that Daniel Andrews and his health ministers handled it. The hypocrites in this place blame Morrison. I have no allegiance to the coalition and I have no allegiance to the Labor Party. I have no allegiance to anyone. Let the facts stand for themselves. Criticising just because we've got an election in the air and you're trying to boost your own numbers? Is that credible? That's not what I hear in this place. You're not credible at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that I have a problem with is the wearing of masks. You wear a mask at the airport, but you don't wear a mask to, say, the State of Origin or other huge sporting matches. At shopping centres you don't have to wear one. Wearing a mask in an airport? It's just absolutely ridiculous. I go back to the time when this all happened and people were still flying on aeroplanes. They said: 'It's very safe on an aeroplane. The air is continually circulated. It's probably the safest place you can be.' Now, you're wearing a mask. So information has changed over a period of time and it will continue to change, because I don't think anyone really has an idea what they're talking about. This is completely new to us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until we have the true facts, I constantly question the number of deaths with COVID. You know, it's okay for them to say, 'They've died from it,' but it was known around the world that if you died in a car crash and you tested positive for COVID then your death would be classed as a COVID death. I remember there was one person who died in the country—I won't state which state—and it was classed as a COVID death. But it was known that it wasn't a COVID death; it was actually suicide. But we had to keep it as that because it would upset the family if it got out. How much of the truth have we been told? How much of a fear factor has gone on here with this COVID? That's what I question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, you can't tell me an autopsy was done on all these people to find out exactly the cause of death, because if you were over a certain age and you tested positive for COVID, that was a COVID death. The fearmongering is unbelievable, what's gone on. I can see the problems in other countries around the world with COVID deaths. Yes, it has been a pandemic. We don't have a pandemic here in Australia because, overall, we have to say, it has been handled very well, when we look at other countries. I will say, based on what's happened in the Labor states and the shutdowns, especially Victoria under a Labor premier, I may not always agree with or like the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, but—I tell you what—I'm glad he's in control and not a Labor Prime Minister, as in Albanese. How would they have dealt with the whole pandemic?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About the vaccines, I've said to people, 'I'm not an anti-vaxxer; I'm pro-choice.' I say to people: 'Go out and do your research. Understand what you're doing; have an understanding of what you may be putting into your body.' Because I can tell you, I don't believe it's been thoroughly researched. We don't know the complications that are going to happen further down the track. Another thing happening these days is you can have your vaccine, but guess what? It doesn't stop you from being locked up into quarantine. They're still insisting that you be locked up. What about all the people in Victoria who have had the vaccination? Why were they locked up for days on end still? If it's safe to have the vaccination, what's the purpose? You're still going to be locked up. You still have to go and quarantine. You still have to wear your mask. And you're supposed to be safe. So to say in here, 'Vaccinate everyone in the country. You will be safe,' safe from what? The vaccine reduces the symptoms you may get but it doesn't stop you from actually getting COVID. These are the facts that people need to know so they can make a well-informed decision of whether or not they want to have the vaccine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've put it on the record that people probably should take medical advice. I'm not a doctor. Take the advice from the doctors, because there are people who have respiratory problems, heart problems, and they probably may need to have the vaccine. We've seen healthy people in their 50s, only just recently, die after having their vaccination shot for COVID. They didn't think once they got that jab in their arm they'd be dead within a few days, possibly the next day. They trusted the government, they trusted our health bureaucrats, and I don't think they've been advised correctly. As I said, I'm not a doctor. I just want people to be well-informed before they actually go and get this vaccination so they know what the impact may be on them. The medical profession is saying that, in relation to the numbers of people who have died, vaccination will help other people. Well, it really doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to them, because it's not their loved one. It's not their wife, their child, their husband, their brother, their sister. That's why it doesn't matter to them. They don't care. I think it's very important that we advise the people correctly on which way to go with having this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't know what's going to happen down the road. I heard Senator Faruqi talking about people not coming back into the country and not having time together and how it's really heartbreaking. That's happening in our own country when the borders are shut down. Daniel Andrews's family couldn't see each other, and they were only a few kilometres away. What about the woman who wanted to go to her father's funeral? She couldn't go. Even in full PPE, she couldn't go to the funeral. She had to see him after the funeral, by herself. There was a woman pregnant with twins. One of the twins died, because the Queensland Premier wouldn't allow her over the border to go to the hospital. Case after case after case, there has been no real compassion whatsoever that is reasonable and common sense. All I see is power and control of the people through this whole COVID rubbish that's been going on. You deal with the issue; you don't destroy people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the hand out of money was unbelievable. When this first hit in April last year, 727,000 people on Newstart allowance got double their money. Their circumstances didn't change, not one iota, but then we doubled their money. The whole thing has been handled atrociously in so many areas, and the taxpayers and future generations are going to be paying for it for a long time to come until we can rein this back in. So, instead of criticising each other, as the leaders of this nation, I suggest you start working together for the people. This is not about an election issue; this goes far beyond that. This is about the people of Australia being looked after.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I also rise to speak on the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (Funding Arrangements) Bill 2021 this afternoon. There's been no shortage of debate in this place as well as in the other place on the COVID-19 pandemic that's currently before us, not just here in Australia but right around the world. We have heard contributions in this place, including the one that we just heard, from senators who are trying to put forward, rightly or wrongly, their own thoughts on ways we can overcome the crisis that we are facing, not only economically but also the health crisis that every state government and the Commonwealth government are trying to handle right now. But, I must say, for senators to come into this place and say that it's not about the politics and to claim that they're not a doctor but still provide that medical advice, all I say to people is that, if you're listening to today's debate, always take the advice of your GP. At the end of the day, we're trying to facilitate the best vaccinations that we can give the Australian people through their GPs and the many vaccination programs right around the country. If anyone were listening to the contribution from Senator Hanson, I would urge them to talk to their doctors. At the end of the day, their doctors are the best place to have that discussion. All we can do here, in parliament, is support our experts, whether they be in the Department of Health or whether they be the state governments, who are doing a very good job of trying to manage the situation that is COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the New South Wales government might be entering a period of uncertainty, just like the Victorian government, in my home state. The state governments have to manage the situation. I take exception to some of the contributions that were made earlier, suggesting that somehow it was the Victorian government that started this pandemic here in the country. Quite frankly, if it weren't for the cooperative work, the good work, by all premiers to ensure that we locked down Australia to protect our citizens, we wouldn't be in the position that we are today. Look right around the world, and you will find that Australia is now the envy of the world. Why? Because our state governments have taken the hard decisions, the right decisions, to protect their citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's good to see the Commonwealth finally come to the table and start to work with the various state governments, whether they're Labor or Liberal, in making sure that Australians do have freedom of movement. And I know there are lockdowns. There are lockdowns, and they may be an annoyance for some. But, quite frankly, I would rather be in lockdown than having thousands of people dying every single day, and that is what is happening right around the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking on the bill that is currently before the chamber, the only reason that this legislation has become necessary is this government's many failures to bring the pandemic under control. Whether it's been the rollout of the vaccination program, the lack of a national quarantine program or even cutting off the JobKeeper payments early, there are a number of issues that the Labor opposition has been asking this government to consider for some time. The government has finally agreed to support a number of people who are currently in need of support where there is a lockdown. I understand that $500 a week has been offered to people who are engaged in paid employment who lose more than 20 hours a week and $325 a week offered for people who are engaged in paid employment who lose less than 20 hours a week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria, this is very important. Currently we're facing quite substantial issues, and many Victorian workers and small businesses need support from their federal government. They've had support from the state government, and it is now time that support is offered by the federal government. I would say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, that, unfortunately, the support is a little bit too little and a bit too late, but it is good to see that the government has finally come to the table. But, out of the $1 trillion deficit that the government have racked up in the last budget, the Treasurer has only managed to find $100 million to support Victorians—the many small businesses and the many workers who are in need of financial assistance. Looking at this bill, the government will have the discretion to ensure that this payment is on offer only where there is one week of lockdown in a month, and that is what's been assumed as part of its budget costings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure of this government to deliver a successful vaccine rollout and a secure quarantine program is hurting not just businesses and workers but also consumers, and people do want to help ensure that there is a speedy economic recovery. At the end of the day, once the economy's back on track and we are able to reopen and have a successful, growing economy, all workers can go back to their offices and their factories and can carry on with normal life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is imperative that we are actually all getting vaccinated, and that is ultimately the key here. The reason why we encourage people to get vaccinated is that, once we do get to a certain level—whatever that level is, and I've heard figures of around 70 per cent to 80 per cent—we'll then be able to avoid lockdowns. But that situation won't occur until the federal government starts to find other providers of vaccines. It's not good enough that they've come in here and said, 'Yes, we've got some contracts for COVID vaccines.' It's taken them some time to actually land deals with many vaccine providers right around the world. Yes, we've got AstraZeneca and Pfizer, but where are the others? Where are the others? I've had many meetings this week, with multiple groups, and it looks promising. It looks like we'll have a lot more vaccines by the end of the year, but these discussions should have occurred 18 months ago. They should have occurred 18 months ago. It seems like the government has taken the cheap and easy option: 'We'll just go with one or two providers who'll give us a vaccine, and everything will be fine.' But that hasn't actually been the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not on our way to the government's target of having everyone vaccinated with one dose by the end of the year. It looks very much like it may not be till the middle of next year, which is quite disappointing because the sooner we can get a certain level of people vaccinated the sooner we can start opening our economy and not be in a situation where state governments have to run our national economy. Unfortunately, the federal government—through the national cabinet process—hasn't been able to deliver nationally consistent rules on having a quarantine program in place. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said all that, it should be no surprise that we've had to have Channel 9 and others roll out a national campaign in terms of public awareness of the vaccine program, to provide access to straightforward information on who is eligible and who is not. That point is really important because, if you keep shifting the goalposts of who is eligible for which vaccines, you then start to undermine the system. That is something that we are trying very hard to avoid. Unfortunately the government has its press conference one week, and that will change with the information that is provided to the Australian public. We really do need this government to make sure that there is a national campaign that is rolled out as soon as possible, because, the sooner we provide the Australian people with the confidence that the vaccination program is safe, the sooner we can increase the number of people who are eligible to receive a vaccination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've even had the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners raise concerns, saying that new targeted advertising campaigns are desperately needed to tackle vaccine hesitancy. We heard earlier from other senators in this place about the unease that a number of people have with finding the appropriate jab for themselves. I cannot stress enough the fact that they should go and speak to their local GP. Make an appointment today. If you're listening to the Senate here, please go and speak to your GP. Make that appointment and have a good chat to them about the risks of having the vaccine jab.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, we want to be talking about other issues as well—how we can better put investment in health and education and grow our economy. But, until we can get the vaccination rates up, it is going to be very difficult for this government to get out of the mess that they've created. But let's also not forget that JobKeeper—and the government finally came to the table with the JobKeeper support payments—</span>

Let's also not forget that it did take a while for the government to come to the table and offer many people that support that was desperately needed, especially in my home state of Victoria. The state government, through the Acting Premier, has also been calling on this government for a couple of days this week to come to the table to clarify where the vaccines are for the many disability workers and aged-care workers in terms of getting priority for groups 1a and 1b. We still haven't been able to get any clear answers from the relevant ministers in this place or, I believe, in the other place to date. I would just urge the government to please listen to the contributions that are being made here in this place today. Please get on with finding more vaccines, because, the sooner we can get more people vaccinated, the sooner we can open up the economy and move on to bigger and better things.</span>

I thank them very much for that contribution. The bill appropriates from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the purposes of making the COVID-19 disaster payment during the 2021-22 financial year. The bill also provides that the National Recovery and Resilience Agency will report on the COVID-19 disaster payment in their annual report. Australians are a resilient people, but sometimes they need support in difficult times. The appropriation ensures that the COVID-19 disaster payment will be available and fully funded should additional lockdowns occur, and of course we hope they won't. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

As we heard from the Chief Medical Officer, the recommendations of the Halton review have been implemented across the states. Ms Halton has made a number of recommendations and public comments, urging states to ensure that their hotel quarantine systems are complying with those processes.</span>

We are supporting every state and territory with the supply information that was provided to them through national cabinet on Monday, and we will continue to do that. As vaccine supply arrangements are confirmed, they will be firmed up and the supplies provided to the states so that we can continue to support Australians.</span>

What we have been able to achieve in Australia amongst the most uncertain and challenging of global times is very much the envy of the world. Australia has managed to save lives and livelihoods like few other countries in the world. Indeed, for nations of our size, scale and standing, we stand head and shoulders above the rest of the world for the saving of lives of Australians through the management of this pandemic and through the saving of livelihoods through the management of this pandemic. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been the largest economic shock to the world since the Great Depression. But, pleasingly, Australia is recovering strongly and creating more opportunities for Australians. Under our economic recovery plan, the Morrison government has committed a record $291 billion of support to the economy to protect the livelihoods of Australians, to keep businesses in business and Australians in jobs. Our plan, laid out in successive budgets last year and this year, creates jobs, guarantees essential services and builds a more resilient and secure Australia. Our plan is based on ensuring that lower taxes create the opportunities for investment—investment by households and investment by Australian businesses—putting more money in the pockets of hard-working Australians, enhancing reward for effort, supporting household demand and creating investment incentives for business, which are leading to more investment, more productivity and, most crucially, more jobs for Australians. That is the No. 1 dividend that we wish to see and that we take pride in: more jobs for Australians, at record levels.</span>

Since the peak of the pandemic, 987,000 jobs have been created, with employment now surpassing its pre-pandemic levels.

It comes from policies that support business to invest and to hire more people—more Australians. That's why our government has got a commitment to lower income taxes. We can guarantee that we will deliver those lower income taxes now and into the future. Those on the other side won't make that same commitment to lower income taxes. We have delivered lower taxes for Australian businesses to encourage investment. Those on the other side have always stood against lower taxes when it comes to investment. Of course, Australians can be thankful that we won the last election and are implementing those lower tax policies, or else we would have seen $387 billion of additional taxes that those opposite took to the last election implemented at precisely the wrong time for Australia, which would have jeopardised— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's all very well for the opposition to repeat something that happened or was said in February and ignore everything that's happened between now and then. In fact, it's quite dishonest of them to continue to do that. We have had to make some adjustments to the rollout as circumstances have changed. We continue to work with the states and territories, using the information that we provided to them yesterday, so that Australians can get access to a vaccine and those that want one can do so by the end of this calendar year.</span>

The Great Barrier Reef suffered its first mass coral bleaching in 1998, the first in recorded history. Even though our best climate models at the time predicted it wasn't possible to have back-to-back mass coral bleachings, they did occur in 2016 and 2017. We had a fourth mass coral bleaching in 2019-20. The reef is believed to have lost half of its coral cover. Your own internal reports in 2019 downgraded the status of the reef from poor to very poor. Last year, UNESCO downgraded the status of the reef to critical. Minister, do you agree that the Great Barrier Reef is in danger?</span>

The plan has been delivered, and it is achieving results. We have reduced pressures on the reef, built reef resilience and strengthened partnerships for the future. The Australian and Queensland governments are now investing more than $3 billion, from 2014-15 to 2023-24, to implement the Reef 2050 Plan. More than $2 billion of this is from the Australian government, which is an unprecedented investment. They are big numbers, but what does that mean at the ground level? It means that the custodian of Lady Elliot Island, Peter Gash, can continue 20 years of work transforming a former island mine—</span>

That is why we are delivering the 2050 plan, which is jointly developed with the Queensland government. The big numbers in that plan mean that the custodian of Lady Elliot Island, Peter Gash, can continue 20 years of work transforming a former island mine site into a world-famous ecological sanctuary. It also means the continued conservation work with sea turtles at Mon Repos and Raine Island. It means that five control vessels are continuing to protect reef resilience by culling coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish on critical reefs in the marine park. And it means that world-leading— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is why the Australian and Queensland governments are now investing more than $3 billion from 2014-15 to 2023-24 to implement the Reef 2050 Plan. More than $2 billion of this is from the Australian government, which is an unprecedented investment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's practical action on emissions reduction goes hand in hand with our practical action on reef protection and climate adaptation. This includes efforts to improve the health of the reef and its resilience to climate change by reducing local and regional pressures and leading the way in reef adaptation science through measures like $150 million for the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program. That's a word-leading project to find innovative ways for the coral reef to adapt to the impacts of climate change, an issue that I know is so dear to your heart, Senator Whish-Wilson. </span>

All the while, three capital cities are facing COVID-19 outbreaks and facing restrictions or lockdowns, there is a complete rewrite of the vaccine rollout and there is no plan for fit-for-purpose quarantine.

I can tell you there is no chaos or confusion on this side of the chamber. You have a look. We have been focusing on the health of Australians, on the economy, on jobs, on education and on disability. There is no confusion on this side about what is important for this nation. As I've said, it is all about the economy. It is about protecting Australians and keeping them safe and healthy.</span>

The answer was: 'If you are trying to suggest there is a problem, I don't understand why you would do that.' Let me ask again: who conducted the most recent audit of the AEC election software, how much did it cost and what was the result?</span>

I can't quite recall whether those details were taken on notice during the estimates hearings. It would not be a surprise to the Senate that I don't have the precise contract details to hand in the chamber. I will take them on notice here, noting they may already have been taken on notice through the estimates process. But I would also state our complete confidence in the integrity and operation of the Australian Electoral Commission.</span>

In relation to the comparison between the paper ballots and data processing, and the steps that the AEC undertake in that regard, I also recall that the commissioner took you through the explanations during the recent estimates hearings. I would refer you to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> in that regard.

Senator Paterson, you are right, that is the priority of the Morrison government, to support employers out there, to support businesses to prosper, to grow and to create more jobs for Australians. COVID-19 has had an absolutely devastating effect on businesses out there, but, because of the economic policies that the Morrison government put in place, we have seen the economy rebound. What we have seen is businesses utilising the policies that we have put in place to prosper, to grow; and, as we know, based on the employment figures—in particular, the most recent employment figures from May 2021—they are certainly creating more jobs for Australians. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government doesn't create jobs, businesses do. Governments put in place the economic framework that businesses can utilise to prosper and grow, and, at this point in time, we are ahead of almost every other country in the world. We now have in Australia more people in employment than we did prior to COVID-19. That is a good thing and it is something we are proud of as a government. It is because of the policies that the government is putting in place. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have delivered record business confidence as a result of our government's economic measures. When you look at those economic measures, the budget's expansion of the full expensing measure has seen the strongest numbers in machinery and equipment investment in 17 years, the strongest numbers in machinery and equipment investment. That's because what we're saying to business is, 'If you have the capacity to invest in yourself, we will back you every step of the way, because we know that, when you invest in yourself, you grow the business and you employ more Australians.'</span>

Indeed, freshwater flows are important to the health and sustainability of river systems. And, as Senator Hanson-Young well knows, the operation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan under the Water Act 2007, introduced by the Howard government, was established to try to put in place sustainable diversion limits for the first time ever across the Murray-Darling Basin, and to date it's been very successful in doing so.</span>

In doing so, consideration is given particularly to matters around flow rates and ensuring that in terms of those flow rates there is a system that is as well managed as can be possible, noting the significant challenges in the system, which is now much more highly regulated than it was in its natural state and has many demands placed upon it—quite reasonable demands.</span>

Those who pretend that the settlement of the Basin Plan by then Minister Burke was simply a binary, straightforward affair are ignoring the fact that, at the time, considerations were given to ensuring that water recovery—particularly in relation to the so-called up-water, as it was described at the time—was to be undertaken and must be undertaken in ways that are mindful of the social and economic impacts of such recovery. They've always been important points. They remain important points in terms of ensuring that the Basin Plan is implemented in a way that is respectful and effective for all the communities who rely upon the river system. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government's respect for the importance of that and for our communities in South Australia is also resolute. The government has made that clear in the last 24 hours.</span>

It is important, in terms of the consideration of those matters of women's safety and women's economic security, that the leadership of the government across the coalition parties hears clearly on those issues of safety and economic security. That's what the purpose of that task force is. It's why the Prime Minister is a member of that task force and co-chairs it with Senator Payne. It's why the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and myself, as Minister for Finance, are all there: to ensure that it informs the decisions right across the government, as it is intended to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We know how important redress is to survivors of institutionalised child sex abuse, and that's why I'm very pleased to have been able to release the final report of the two-year anniversary review of the scheme as well as the government's interim response. The report was prepared by an independent reviewer. It outlines how Robyn Kruk believes the scheme can be improved and can provide a better survivor experience. Our interim response also ensures that survivors have as much information as they possibly can when they're making that decision as to whether they wish to pursue redress. So, to ensure that the scheme is operating as it's intended to and in the best interests of survivors, in the recent budget we provided an additional investment of more than $80 million for that purpose. We believe it is absolutely essential that we continue to listen to advocates and survivors, because we want this scheme to be the best possible scheme it can be and, in particular, that it's survivor focused.</span>

It's something that we heard was very important to survivors not just because of the financial support that it provides but also as an acknowledgement, saying that we understand what they have been through. But we can't do this alone. We also have to work with the states and territories on the design changes that have been put forward. To date, we have got more than 65,000 sites on board, more than 6½ thousand applications have been finalised and more than half a billion dollars has been provided in redress to survivors of institutional child sex abuse.</span>

These institutions are the Forrest Tennis Club here in the ACT, the CYMS Basketball Association in Victoria and the Devonport Community Church in Tasmania. In addition, I had already named Kenja Communication, who continues to remain recalcitrant about joining the scheme. It is totally and utterly unacceptable that any institution fails to meet its moral obligations and sign up to the scheme so that survivors of institutional child sex abuse have access to redress. We will continue to take action wherever we possibly can to try and encourage organisations to take responsibility if they have any experience or any history of working with children.</span>

I can assure the Senate that further consideration and consultation will continue to take place on the recommendations that we need to be working on, with the states and territories, and we'll provide a full response to all recommendations in early 2022. But, as I said, the most important thing is to continue with the survivor focused nature of what we're doing. Most of the recommendations require the support of the states and territories, and so we will continue to work with those states and territories as an absolute matter of priority. We're also, though, committed to working with survivors and other stakeholders. Our government is absolutely committed to working with survivors to ensure that this scheme is as focused as it can be on providing them with the redress that they so justly deserve.</span>

South-East Queensland's exciting bid for the 2032 Olympics and Paralympics has received the bell for the final lap and the finishing line is very much in sight. An Olympics has the potential to be a game changer for Queensland, and the government remains committed to supporting Queensland's candidature. Bringing the games to Australia in 2032 would provide a unique opportunity to inspire all Australians to get engaged and active in sport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government, the Queensland government, the Council of Mayors South East Queensland and the Australian Olympic Committee have worked very cooperatively in developing a comprehensive bid submission to the IOC's Future Host Commission. This included a virtual tour of South-East Queensland earlier last month. I'm thrilled to say that on 10 June the International Olympic Committee executive board agreed to propose Brisbane as the host for the 2032 games to the IOC membership. This is the final stage of candidature, but it does not mean that Brisbane has secured the 2032 games. On 20 and 21 July, at the 138th IOC session held in Tokyo, IOC members will receive a final presentation on the proposed bid for the 2032 games. Members will then vote on whether Brisbane is the host for the 2032 games.</span>

They also bring major social and economic benefits. An assessment by KPMG commissioned by the Queensland government shows that the 2032 games will deliver a total benefit of $8.1 billion for Queensland and $17.61 billion for Australia. The report found the 2032 games will create 91,600 full-time-equivalent job years for Queensland and 122,900 job years nationally. The report notes significant quantifiable social benefits derived from the 2032 games, including health community benefits.</span>

A national partnership agreement between the Commonwealth and the Queensland government, which provides up to $10 million to support the bid process, has been signed. As part of the bid process, the Commonwealth has provided a number of guarantees in areas such as security, immigration and taxation that are vital to the successful operation of such a major international event. And the Prime Minister has committed to funding required for crucial games infrastructure, with funding to be provided on a 50-50 basis with the Queensland government. These infrastructure investments will, of course, cater for the '32 bid for the games, but it's the long-term use of these facilities for local communities and sporting organisations that is at the forefront of our planning.</span>

Just weeks ago we had no community transmission of COVID in Australia. That was the good news supplied just weeks ago. But, as we stand here in the Senate today, outbreaks from hotel quarantine are now leading to potential lockdowns in New South Wales and significant restrictions are in place, and three cases of community transmission have been reported this morning in Queensland. And, of course, we saw the outbreak earlier in Victoria.</span>

There are significant challenges going on for the people of New South Wales right now from an airport driver who was unvaccinated. Whose responsibility is vaccination supply? It's the federal government's—the Morrison government's. These COVID outbreaks sit squarely at the feet of the Commonwealth government—the Morrison government.

That won't happen. They promised that four million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March. That did not happen. They promised that all of category 1a would be vaccinated by Easter. That did not happen. Who is in 1a? They are the frontline healthcare workers, border and quarantine workers, people living and working in aged-care and disability settings. They have not been vaccinated yet. The Morrison government promised that six million Australians would be vaccinated by 10 May. That did not happen.</span>

We don't just have one horizon; we have 27 horizons in this Morrison government's supposed vaccine strategy.

That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to make sure that Australians are kept safe and alive. That's what all our efforts are focused on. That's why we went through all the costs last year of closing our international borders and, for a time, shutting down our economy. It was to keep Australians alive. And because the opposition has nothing to say on that matter, they are going for all these other issues. But it is important to come back to the fact that this year not one Australian here in Australia has died from coronavirus—not one person. Overseas, more than two million people have died this year from coronavirus. The equivalent of the whole town of Brisbane has, unfortunately, died as a result of this global pandemic. It is a terrible, shocking and tragic thing that has happened to the world. But here in this country, with the cooperation of Australians, by working together with state governments, Australians have largely been kept alive. We are very, very lucky.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition would like to compare us to Mars or somewhere, where there's no risk. They'd like us to be like an outer planet where there's no coronavirus—absolutely no risk at all. Well, that world doesn't exist here. We have to accept risk. We have to get Australians back home—which the opposition was calling for last year; they wanted more Australians to come home. We have to get them home, and when they come home from countries that have lots of coronavirus there are risks. Yes, there have been outbreaks from hotel quarantine. But that is to be expected in a risky environment. The more than 99 per cent of people who have gone through hotel quarantine have not led to any community transmission, because hotel quarantine has worked pretty well. It's not perfect. No system is perfect. Even if everybody were vaccinated, guess what? Vaccines are not perfect. You can still contract or transmit the coronavirus after getting a vaccine.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure we get Australia vaccinated as fast as possible, but we were right to be cautious with our vaccine rollout, as we have seen with the problems experienced with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The opposition have not been mature about this issue. At every point they have operated like a panicked child—with every bad-news story that has come about. At the start of the year the Leader of the Opposition, Anthony Albanese, was wanting us to vaccinate people as soon as possible, even before our own health authorities had gone through the proper assessments of the vaccines. If we'd adopted that approach, we probably would have ended up with more Australians dying from the AstraZeneca vaccine than we have. Two Australians have died, linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. More have died in Australia this year from the vaccine rollout than from coronavirus. It's a tragic thing. Again, the vaccine has risks. Life has risks. It was right and proper for us to make sure we assessed those risks proportionate to the risks we face from coronavirus and to be cautious about the rollout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When issues with AstraZeneca were first exposed a few months ago I called for a pause so that we could look at it, and I was pilloried by the opposition. They would come into Senate estimates and say, 'What a crazy person that Senator Canavan is!' Well, now we know that there are real risks and that we were right to look very closely at those risks. But, again, the opposition, acting like a child, jumps up and down, panics and runs into the corner, rather than dealing with the facts of life. A fact of life is that there are risks. Our job, as a sensible, mature, adult government, is to manage those risks as reasonably as we can, to get them as low as we can. But they'll never disappear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to be upfront with the Australian people about the risks we face in a world where there is a global pandemic. But, on every score, on every measure, we have kept Australians safe. We have made sure that many more people have stayed alive in Australia than has been the case in other countries over the past year. That is a great success. I'm confident, after the cooperation we have seen from Australians over the last year, that we will receive the same type of cooperation as we get more vaccine doses, as the Pfizer and Moderna doses come in later this year. We will get those vaccination rates. We will get out of this. We will rebuild our country. We will come out of this safer and stronger than we were before. But we'll only do that if we stop panicking, stop being panic merchants, as the opposition constantly are when they enter this debate. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  That last contribution says so much about what's wrong with the Morrison government. You've got a government that is run by an advertising executive, and Senator Canavan, who represents the most reasonable-sounding of the maddest of the coalition backbench, is the voice in the back of their head: 'Don't worry about it. It's not a race. Vaccines could be dangerous.' That's what's wrong with this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we speak today, the situation in New South Wales—far from being a panic—appears to be moving quickly, and the government in New South Wales is working its way through its response. There are multiple locations, and it's fair to say that New South Wales is in a more perilous position than it has been for many, many months. Indeed, the New South Wales parliament appears to have had a spread inside its own building. I want to commend two MPs in that place who have displayed remarkable leadership. Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Minns, immediately upon learning about this put the interests of the state before his own political interests and postponed his budget reply speech. Mr Minns has recently taken over the leadership of the New South Wales Labor Party, and it could reasonably have been expected that that opportunity to speak to the people of New South Wales would have been a significant milestone for him. But, without question, he put the interests of other people before his own political interests. I also want to commend the minister for agriculture in New South Wales, Mr Marshall, who has contracted the coronavirus himself and issued a very sensible statement. I wish him well, an important part of the process when political leaders contract the disease.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I tell you what. While I don't want to pre-empt any of the decisions of the New South Wales government, and they will have to make some difficult decisions in the days ahead, the Premier of New South Wales has been very clear this week about the problem. She has pointed the finger directly at the Morrison government. Senator Canavan might think that the bungled vaccine rollout is not a problem, but Ms Berejiklian knows that just over three per cent of New South Wales residents are fully vaccinated, that the level of supply is nowhere near the level of demand and that New South Wales is a global laggard, just like the rest of Australia, because Mr Morrison couldn't run a bath. He can't manage his way through this problem. The country had the opportunity to seize this issue and actually approach a public health issue with the seriousness it deserved. Mr Morrison has entirely bungled the vaccine rollout. We couldn't be in a worse position than Mr Morrison has put Australia in. We are 100th in the queue. Other countries overseas with similar health systems—and even the Americans, whose health system is in a very poor state—are in the high 30s and mid-40s in terms of the amount of their populations vaccinated. And guess what? They'll be opening up. There will be opportunities for their citizens and their businesses because they've got the vaccine rollout right. Mr Morrison has bungled it for every Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we turn to hotel quarantine—absolutely criticised by anybody who knows anything about quarantine. What have we had? Dozens of outbreaks from hotel quarantine. Fifteen months—Mr Morrison has had 15 months to prepare purpose-built quarantine facilities across Australia, and what has Mr Morrison achieved? Precisely nothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has squandered the opportunity to fix vaccines and to fix quarantine, and he has left Australia in a vulnerable place, where we are less safe, where growth will be held back and Australia will be held back because of his failures and his incapacity to put the national interest ahead of his own narrow political interest.</span>

It's just extraordinary, this constant talking-down that we see of Australia's efforts around the entire COVID pandemic. We know that you don't understand the basic economics of the pandemic and all the programs we put in place to ensure Australians were able to stay connected to their employers. We've now got less unemployment than we had pre the pandemic. And that was all at a time when, over there, those naysayers were all, 'Don't end JobKeeper; the economy's going to fall off the cliff.' Guess what? It keeps getting better. And that's because of the leadership of the Morrison government, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come to the vaccine rollout, the 20/20 'hindsight vision' displayed by those opposite is breathtaking. I'm just so impressed by how you are all, apparently, expert epidemiologists and knew clearly before the actual experts what was going to happen with regard to the vaccines! In fact, in last March who would have thought we'd have a vaccine by this stage? This has been the most incredible rollout—and the efforts by science and research to ensure that we could move towards a vaccine at all. In Australia we have four vaccines lined up and, by the time we get to October, there will be two million doses per week of the Pfizer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had my first Pfizer jab, in New South Wales—because Gladys Berejiklian continues to demonstrate a gold standard in every single way. I am not in the over-50 category. I would like that on the record! Maybe I should say it again: I qualified for the Pfizer, and the Pfizer was for ages 40 to 49. You don't feel smug about it anymore now that it goes up to 59, but back then in New South Wales it was the 40- to 49-year-olds who were entitled to the Pfizer. I've had the first jab and I'm looking forward to my second jab next week. That would make me just one of 140,000 Australians who received a dose of the vaccine, because that's how many received it yesterday. And, if today we see another 140,000 Australians receive a dose of the vaccine, that will put us at seven million vaccine doses that have been delivered. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear from over there so much misinformation, and it is absolutely so dangerous to continue to propagate these lies and this deceit to the Australian people. It is creating more fear and uncertainty, and you should be ashamed. The reality is that the vaccine is not available to under-16s. So, when we talk about the percentage of the population, let's remove the under-16s, shall we? And most states are making it available to only the over-50s. So we need to remove everyone under 16. Except in New South Wales and, I think, a couple of other places that are allowing those in their 40s—</span>

Have a nice glass of water with it, after you've had your vaccine—not that anyone drinks water from South Australian taps, and I can say that as an old Adelaide girl. You have your vaccine—seven million doses. In the last seven days we've had nearly 800,000 doses given. Like every other country in the world, vaccine rollouts have had a growth period. They're a bit slow when they start out, but they pick up the pace exponentially. In fact, to go from four million to five million doses took just nine days, and to go from five million to six million doses took 10 days, but that did include a public holiday. So maybe we can look at nine being the standard for the last two weeks for every million doses. </span>

Almost half—and, in fact, by today it looks like it will be half—of all Australians over 50 are protected.</span>

Both Senator Canavan and Senator Hughes have the Monty Python defence—always look on the bright side of life. The reality is the bright side of life is seeing the Australian community being economically crucified because the government has not got its act together. We have seen the lockdowns due to the quarantine failures in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. That's where responsibility should be taken by this government, saying, 'We are going to rectify this.' They should be coming in here, saying, 'We're going to fix these problems,' not saying how they're going to turn around and avoid taking responsibility for what has been going on in this country right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless they have been living under a rock, everyone in Australia knows that the Morrison government has botched the vaccine rollout. We have had one of the slowest vaccine rollouts of any developed country in the world. The Prime Minister says it's not a race. That's because it's a race we are losing because of his lack of desire to make sure we get the right outcomes. He took time off to go sightseeing in Cornwall, enjoying the benefits of a country which has actually vaccinated its citizens. The story is very different when it comes to residents in my state of New South Wales. What Australians don't know is just how badly the Morrison and Berejiklian governments have botched hotel quarantine in New South Wales. While the state government has introduced a hotel quarantine process for international arrivals, I have been informed today by multiple whistleblowers working in the airport quarantine system that the quarantine process for crew from international passenger or freight flights is a sham. It's a complete and utter sham.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been told directly by three different whistleblowers working in this process that buses which are used to transport international arrivals to hotel quarantine are cleaned comprehensively by cleaners in full PPE and between every single trip—a tick for that. That is best practice. The Australian Defence Force have been brought in to load luggage onto these buses in a COVID-safe manner—a tick for that. That's best practice as well. But, for international crew on passenger or freight flights, none of these systems are in place—none. The vehicles used to transport crew from the airport to the hotel are not cleaned between trips. In actual fact, you could go out to Sydney airport and see there's a cone between the passenger buses and the international flight crew buses. One gets cleaned; the other doesn't. Until Friday last week, those same people moving international crews also weren't wearing masks. So if a crew member with COVID sits in one of these minivans then every other crew member who sits in that vehicle for the rest of the day—or even days later—including the driver, is stepping into a viral bomb. And the Australian Defence Force isn't used to load bags into these vehicles. The drivers are forced to do it themselves, without PPE, except maybe a face mask—and that's only since last Friday. And it's one of these drivers who are driving vehicles that are not cleaned and who have to touch all the luggage themselves who has set off the cluster which is now spreading like wildfire across Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't the first time. The Northern Beaches cluster just before Christmas was also started by one of those drivers who had not got the processes in place. So this government is failing to economically protect New South Wales and the rest of this country. How has the federal government allowed two entirely different COVID safety procedures to be put in at Sydney airport? There's one for big buses—maybe that's why they thought it was necessary—but none for any other buses, even though they're still transporting international crew around and exposing Australian crews and the Australian community. Once those drivers are infected, as we've seen with the New South Wales cluster, people are infected right across the community. The quarantine and transport hub at Sydney airport needs to be fixed. It needs to be rectified. And we need to make sure that we hold this government to account for what it's doing—wrecking our economy and exposing our people to an epidemic. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy (Senator Hume) to a question without notice asked by Senator Whish-Wilson today relating to climate change and the Great Barrier Reef.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the answers by Senator Hume, representing the environment minister, in response to questions asked by my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson in relation to the great threat the Great Barrier Reef is under because of climate change. The UN body responsible for World Heritage listing and for the managing and overseeing of World Heritage sites has been very concerned with the health of the Great Barrier Reef. Earlier this week, they declared the Great Barrier Reef to be under such stress, such danger, from climate change that they want to list it as such. This is one of the world's greatest reefs. It's one of the world's most precious environmental places. It's one of Australia's most precious spots. It is iconic—it's what the rest of the world think of when they think of the land down under—and it is under threat because of climate change and environmental mismanagement. Nemo is under threat because of Mr Barnaby Joyce, with his obsession with coal and the fossil fuel industry, and because of the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. Prime Minister Morrison and Deputy Prime Minister Joyce are killing Nemo on the Great Barrier Reef. That's what is going on here. The world is watching, and people are horrified. And they know that Australia has been aware of the threat for a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the UN made the declaration earlier this week, the government and the environment minister herself, Sussan Ley, said that they were blindsided. What absolute rubbish. If you were blindsided, despite all of the warnings from the scientists, despite all of the work that's been going on, despite all of the warning signs, all of the conversations and all of the money that has been spent by this government, then you're either incompetent or you're trying to pull the wool over the eyes of not just the Australian people but the rest of the world. Australia should be ashamed that our government has let the Great Barrier Reef deteriorate to this level. There has been bleaching event after bleaching event, and still, on the international stage, we have Australia's Prime Minister arguing for less action on climate change. We have the resources minister promoting selling more resource fossil fuels overseas. We have ministers in this place pretending that the science of climate change can just be ignored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one at UNESCO and not many Australians were shocked or blindsided by the decision and the announcement that the Great Barrier Reef is under great threat from climate change. Year 8 students in South Australia know that the climate is killing our reef. Scientists have been warning the Australian government that this would happen. In this very place, the Greens have been warning the government that we needed to act faster. It is just absolute rubbish for the minister to suggest that she was blindsided. Either she was wilfully blind or she's incompetent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: as we head to the election, either at the end of this year or into next year, Australians will remember that this is the government that has killed Nemo, that has funnelled more money to the fossil fuel industry and that is overseeing the death of the Great Barrier Reef. While the rest of the world is crying out for more ambition to tackle climate change and reduce pollution, our Deputy Prime Minister is side by side with the Prime Minister of Australia taking money from fossil fuel companies and wanting to pollute more, more, more.</span>

This inquiry also examined whether the Dairy Industry Code of Conduct should be extended across the entire domestic supply chain to include retailers and their dealings with processors. The government initiated this inquiry in response to ongoing concerns expressed by farmers across dairy, horticulture and other perishable commodities that unfair treatment by retailers continues to be evident. The ACCC provided its report on this inquiry to the Treasurer on 27 November 2020. The government continues to consider the findings and recommendations of the report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government notes the recommendation refers to the voluntary industry code, launched by the peak industry body for the Australian dairy industry, the Australian Dairy Industry Council (ADIC) in June 2017 to help ensure greater transparency and fairness in milk supply and pricing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2019 the Government introduced the mandatory Dairy Industry Code of Conduct in response to the ACCC Dairy Inquiry Final Report which concluded that the introduction of a mandatory dairy code of conduct could help address power imbalances in the dairy industry between farmers and processors by improving the quality of information and price signals, enable fairer allocation of risk, and remove restrictions on farmers' ability to switch processors.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through its inquiry the ACCC considered the effectiveness of the voluntary code and reported that it had a positive impact on some contract terms offered by some processors to some farmers for the 2017-18 dairy season. In particular, processors that signed on to the code made improvements to contract terms for setting and varying prices, exclusivity supply clauses and loyalty and other bonus payments. However, the ACCC found that the non-enforceability of the voluntary code was an inherent weakness which could not be addressed by industry alone.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Dairy Industry Council commenced a review of the voluntary industry code to address the findings of the ACCC's dairy inquiry, which was released in April 2018. During the process of completing this review - and in light of the ACCC's findings and recommendations - the peak body for dairy farmers, the Australian Dairy Farmers (ADF) changed its position on the best approach to implement the code and requested that it transition to a mandatory code of conduct.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The mandatory Dairy Industry Code of Conduct came into effect on 1 January 2020 and includes requirements about the conduct of business relationships between dairy farmers and processors. All farmers and processors are bound by the requirements of the code with some exceptions for small businesses. The code replaces ADIC's voluntary code and seeks to address market failures that were not sufficiently addressed in provisions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition and Consumer Act 2010 </span>(CCA).</span>

In particular, the ACCC identified a number of positive developments in terms of the operation of the Dairy Code including evidence of competition among processors on raw milk prices after prices were announced on 1 June 2020; and increased transparency as farmers were able to access price information a sufficient period ahead of needing to make a decision about which processor to supply.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CCA generally requires businesses to act independently of their competitors when making decisions about pricing, which firms they do business with, and the terms and conditions of doing business. Competitors who act collectively in these areas are at risk of breaching the competition provisions of the CCA. However, as noted in the Senate report, businesses can seek ACCC approval to provide protection from legal action under the CCA. Approval is not automatic, and the ACCC assesses each application to decide if the public benefit outweighs the public detriment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the dairy industry, dairy farmers have been collectively bargaining with milk processors since 2001. The first authorisation was to one group of farmers, followed by ACCC authorisation to Australian Dairy Farmers (ADF) in 2002 to apply broadly to dairy farmers collectively negotiating with dairy processors. In 2011, the ACCC granted a 10-year renewal to ADF to collectively bargain with milk processors. This authorisation enables dairy farmers to form and register collective bargaining groups under ADF's existing authorisation without having to separately apply to the ACCC.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the terms of reference of its Dairy Inquiry, the ACCC considered the role of collective bargaining and its effectiveness in the industry. The ACCC Final Report 2018, while not disregarding collective bargaining as an option in the future, did not consider this measure was a broad remedy to address imbalances of bargaining power between processors and farmers in the dairy industry. It instead recommended the implementation of a mandatory code of conduct for the dairy industry, which was progressed by government and took effect on 1 January 2020. The code improves the balance in bargaining power between dairy farmers and processors and replaced the previous voluntary industry code.</span>

The class exemption will apply to a business with an aggregated turnover of less than $10 million in the financial year preceding when it joins a collective bargaining group. This class exemption will remove the need for these businesses to seek authorisation or lodge a notification, meaning that they could access the exemption without delay or additional cost and realise the benefits of collective bargaining. The ACCC will engage directly with agricultural industry associations in 2021 to explain how the class exemption for collective bargaining may be beneficial and how businesses can access the regime.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Co-operatives and other collaborative business arrangements have potential to hand more control back to farmers while reducing costs and improving production efficiencies. A collaborative model allows farmers to function like a larger body while retaining their own independent business structure. This will enable them to take greater ownership along the supply chain and may boost their bargaining position and deliver increased returns at the farm gate. Increased returns are important to the profitability of Australian farmer, fishers and• foresters and to the sustainability of economies in regional communities. In 2018-19 there were over 2,000 co-operative and mutual enterprises in Australia, many of them regionally based.</span>

The aim of the amnesty was to reduce the number of unregistered firearms in Australia. The amnesty did not target legally registered firearms and did not involve a buyback. The amnesty provided an opportunity for those individuals who possess an unregistered firearm to hand it in without fear of being prosecuted.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  I present the first interim report of the Select Committee on Job Security on on-demand platform work in Australia. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This first interim report of the Senate Select Committee on Job Security, and the context in which the inquiry was undertaken, is important. Australian workers have suffered through record low wage growth under this government over the last eight years. The Australian middle class is shrinking in this country under this government's watch. The government forecasted in the recent federal budget that real wages would decline over the next four years. The Reserve Bank has warned that stagnant wages are a risk to our economic recovery. It's clear, even before the pandemic, that there is something structurally wrong in our economy. When wages have stopped growing, this is where the inquiry into job security comes in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first interim report is the first ever report by this parliament focused specifically on the impact of gig platforms on the Australian economy and Australian jobs. Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of Uber's launch in Australia. Uber now claims to be the second-largest employer in Australia, with 120,000 workers across rideshare and the food industry. Not a single one of these 120,000 drivers and delivery riders, who were on the front line during the pandemic, are classified as employees or have rights as contractors. Instead, they're described as entrepreneurs, each running their own individual small business for Uber. I think that sounds absolutely absurd. When one brave Uber Eats worker, Amita Gupta, questioned this logic in the Federal Court, Justice White said, 'I'm just wondering whether we're operating in the real world.' As the Transport Workers Union revealed at one of our hearings earlier this month, Uber was so scared about the outcome of that case and the precedent it would set for operators and their operations that they agreed to settle Ms Gupta's case for $400,000. The amount she stood to gain, if she won, was just $15,000 as a maximum. Uber settled at more than 25 times the amount that Ms Gupta was asking for so as to ensure that their workers would not be classified as employees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This model, of course, is not unique to Uber. It is the business model for the majority of platforms we hear from. Why? Because under the existing industrial relations framework, if you are an employee, you're entitled annual leave, sick leave, superannuation, protection from unfair dismissal, workers compensation and a minimum wage. But if you're an independent contractor, as these companies deem them to be, you're entitled to none of these rights. Companies like Uber and Amazon have made a lot of money avoiding those rights. The inquiry has received evidence from numerous witnesses that the average hourly wage for delivery riders is a disgrace. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Transport Workers Union, the average pay for food delivery workers is just $10.42 an hour and as little as $6.67 an hour. The dissenting report by the coalition senators on this committee has contested this figure as being politically motivated, but in addition to the Transport Workers Union data, a submission by academics from the University of Sydney, the University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University put the average wage rate at just $12 an hour. Other evidence received from the Centre for Future Work and, separately, from the Young Workers Centre makes similar assertions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only data supporting the claim by Uber and the dissenting report comes from Uber itself. Uber says in its own report, of itself, that it's paying the minimum wage under 'certain circumstances', not all. In actual fact, when they were cross-examined during inquiry, they very clearly admitted that the rate that they were paying, which they said was above the minimum wage, did not include superannuation, did not include workers compensation and did not include other entitlements that we take for granted in the Australian community. I asked Uber what their riders earn outside peak times. They refused to respond, because they just calculated their underpayment during peak times. They couldn't even get it right. They obviously don't know what the minimum wage is, from their own evidence, let alone from their 'experts', who obviously don't know what the minimum wage is. Companies like Uber and Amazon despise transparency, which brings me to the first group of recommendations in this interim report. It is that the ABS and appropriate regulators begin collecting data on and from gig platforms. We need their data or we'll continue to be fed lies and half-truths, like Uber has done here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next set of recommendations in this report concerns safety and workers compensation. If you're getting paid just $6 an hour, then you need to rush and take risks on the road. In just a few months at the end of last year, the lives of five delivery workers—Dede Fredy, Chow Khai Shien, Xiaojun Chen, Bijoy Paul and Ik Wong—were taken while working for these platforms, and because Safe Work does not properly collect data on gig worker injuries and fatalities, there could be more deaths that have never been revealed. There may be people in this country who have gone to work and never come home, and we don't even know about it. That's an absolute disgrace. Recommendation 3 calls for Safe Work finally to be empowered to collect this data, after 10 years and who knows how many injuries and deaths. It's also a disgrace that the families of these five riders have been denied access to workers compensation because they were independent contractors, as deemed by their employer. Recommendation 6 of this report calls for the system to be changed to ensure any platform worker, regardless of their status, receives the basic rights. But we should not stop there. Recommendation 7 calls for changes to the Fair Work Act to ensure that workers who fall outside the current definition of 'employee' are not left without basic rights and protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendations 9, 10 and 11 deal with giving the Fair Work Commission a new, low-cost tribunal. The ability to resolve disputes involving vulnerable workers, like gig workers, against these powerful multinational platforms in an affordable, accessible and fair way is critical. Speaking of vulnerable people, the most outrageous evidence the committee has received is about the creeping infiltration of our publicly funded and highly feminised sectors—the NDIS and aged care. Big gig platforms like Mable and Careseekers are saying—like Uber—that  their workers are classified as independent contractors. As with Uber, these workers are paid below the minimum wage. This is about caring for our most vulnerable Australians: the elderly and the disabled. These are the people who are doing that caring. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we treat them, under this government's watch? The government has said consistently that it's too complicated to give these workers minimum rights and minimum conditions. The Morrison government gave $5 million to Mable to provide surge workforce in an Anglicare aged-care home near Penrith last year. Anglicare told the royal commission that 'it quickly became apparent that the staff at Mable could provide but did not have the skills and qualifications that were needed'. Seventeen residents died of COVID-19 in that home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is paying gig platforms to rip off workers and deliver inadequate care. And it gets worse. I thank the Australian Services Union for raising this issue of this inquiry, because Mable and other platforms classify these NDIS carers as independent contractors, and they may not be liable for safety under our workplace health and safety laws. The government is allowing these platforms to offload legal liability for safety to our most vulnerable Australians, the disabled. Neither Safe Work Australia nor the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission have confirmed whether disabled Australians are legally liable here. It is horrifying, and it is a ticking time bomb. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of recommendations in the report deal specifically with the reckless spread of gig platforms into our national treasure, the NDIS. This is just the first report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted; debate adjourned. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I wish to take note of the interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's response to the coup in Myanmar</span>. In contrast to the sadly underwhelming response from the Australian government in terms of Myanmar, this report, which was a consensus, cross-party report, provides a strong set of recommendations, which the Australian Greens support. I encourage people to read the report. Let me just touch on a few key recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 2 is that the Australian government should formally engage with groups and individuals representing the legitimately elected representatives of Myanmar, including the CRPH and the National Unity Government. We think it is disappointing that to date this hasn't occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election took place, the Australian government joined in with a number of other countries in calling for democratic norms in Myanmar to be respected. It turns out it's easier to issue statements before elections, but, when it comes to meeting with the people elected through that democratic process, the Australian government have been much more reticent. We support that recommendation. We call on the Australian government to meet with their counterparts in the National Unity Government, including at ministerial level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 5 of this report recommends the Australian government should explore pathways to permanent residency for Myanmar nationals in Australia, given the uncertain situation they face in Myanmar. Again, we completely support that recommendation. It's something that we've called for previously. I wrote in March to the foreign minister, calling for people from Myanmar who are in Australia to be offered protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly talk about recommendation 6, which is about the need for targeted sanctions. The Greens made additional comments that go to that point. The committee's recommendation, which we support, recommends that the Australian government further considers imposing targeted sanctions upon additional senior figures in the Tatmadaw and Tatmadaw-linked entities, including the MEC and the MEHL, who have played a role in the overthrow of democracy and the subsequent violent suppression of protests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a tragedy that, while people in Myanmar have called for action and countries around the world have responded, we have seen no action from the Australian government. We've also called publicly for a Magnitsky framework, another area where the government is dragging its feet. Last night we saw reporting in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> throwing public servants under the bus, because the ministers have failed to act on the recommendations for Magnitsky legislation. We know from estimates that the foreign minister has written to the Prime Minister, but as of last estimates the Prime Minister hasn't responded. The political spinners in the ministerial wing can blame the Public Service as much as they want, but the reality in the Westminster system is that the ministers are responsible. The Prime Minister should get on and answer that letter, so that we can get on with it, and join a number of other countries in creating a framework for targeted sanctions against human rights abusers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to Myanmar, we know that there is the capacity to introduce sanctions without a Magnitsky framework. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have told us that. In fact, they already have sanctions against five Tatmadaw people in Myanmar because of their violent repression and persecution of the Rohingya some years back. We need to sanction more of those Tatmadaw military leaders urgently, including the leader of the junta, Min Aung Hlaing. A Magnitsky framework would be a clear improvement, but instead we've seen nothing but equivocation on the ability to impose sanctions now. This isn't about a framework delaying things. It's about a deliberate decision being made by the foreign minister not to impose targeted sanctions on people who've violated human rights and been sanctioned by a number of other countries, including the UK, the EU, the US and Canada.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have noted in our additional comments, people on the ground in Myanmar are calling for sanctions. There were letters sent from almost 400 civil society organisations in Myanmar to our foreign minister, calling for sanctions. They said that Australia is lagging behind other Western governments in its response to the Myanmar coup, and that Australia must use its middle power status and leadership role in the region to call for strong action against the military regime. They provided a number of recommendations in the letter. Among them they said that, in particular, the Australian government must enact sanctions against the military, its leaders, its business interests and business partners. This must include military conglomerates, MEC and MEHL, and their national oil and gas company, MOGE.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on the ground are calling for sanctions, and countries around the world have acted, but Australia has yet to act. As we highlighted in our additional comments, the Australian Council for International Development has pointed out this discrepancy, saying that Australia is 'out of step with international efforts to end the violent coup in Myanmar':</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union have imposed sanctions on a total of 38 individuals and 17 entities associated with the junta.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since Myanmar's military seized power from the democratically elected government on 1 February this year, the Australian Government has imposed no new sanctions on military leaders or their business interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly point out that two of Australia's former ambassadors to Myanmar have pointed out the value of imposing sanctions. Former ambassador Nicholas Coppel wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The people of Myanmar are looking to the international community for support, especially from liberal democracies like Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It gives them hope and encouragement to sustain their struggle. And while our neighbours in Asia will not join the chorus they will not be surprised that we speak out (as they have seen us do on many other international issues) and it will give more leverage to the less confrontational style of ASEAN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to weigh the softly-softly approach with its very remote possibility of influencing the senior general today against the real possibility of damaging Australia's reputation and ability to influence a future democratic government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, former Australian ambassador Christopher Lamb said, 'Carefully targeted sanctions can be useful and should be part of our package.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate this afternoon the need for the Australian government to urgently impose targeted sanctions. I would add that the reasoning by the department and the foreign minister as to why we haven't imposed sanctions so far has been unclear and equivocal at best. The simple reality is that Australians deserve better. The people of Myanmar deserve better, and the many people around the world who are campaigning for justice for the Myanmar people on this issue deserve better. Today I have lodged a notice of motion for another order for the production of documents requiring a Magnitsky report. Beyond that, I will be exploring procedural options to require a statement from the minister on sanctions against the key Tatmadaw generals who have led this coup. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the report that I am responding to today is a very important report. As I said, it covers the full spectrum of this parliament. It calls on the government to further consider the issue of sanctions. I reiterate the call that Australia needs to be urgently imposing sanctions on the key personnel in the junta in Myanmar. To those protesting in Myanmar and those around the world supporting their struggle for justice, I say again: we see you, we hear you and we will do our best to amplify your message in this parliament.</span>

                    <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I'd also like to make some brief comments in regard to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's interim report regarding Australia's response to the coup in Myanmar. While I am not a member, I want to congratulate the committee. I have read avidly the transcripts of the hearings that have been conducted, and I think it's a very worthwhile exercise for the committee to explore these particular points.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am someone who's not yet satisfied by Australia's response to the military coup in Myanmar. I want to congratulate the Burmese diaspora in our country, which has a very rich history. Many came to our country in the 1960s. Many have come to our country in more recent times, as part of the humanitarian program. I congratulate them on their strong and consistent advocacy—certainly in Perth but also around the country—in drawing the attention of other Australians to the very important issues in regard to the coup in Myanmar. If Australia has strong words to say about democracy in our region and about the importance of the rule of law, then responding to the coup in Myanmar is a very easy and immediate way to demonstrate those values and to put them in action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two points have concerned me. I prosecuted these politely at Senate estimates. One is the reticence of officials to publish details of their engagement with the National Unity Government. In my discussions with senior representatives of the National Unity Government they have been very willing to have that information disclosed. And I agree that disclosure of meetings, or consent to disclosure of meetings, between officials and the National Unity Government representatives allows, prepares—is a precursor for—official engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I've been concerned about is that I'm not yet convinced that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been engaging thoroughly enough with the Myanmar diaspora. On that point, I'm still prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt for a period. But if Australia's foreign policy is to enjoy the endorsement and the consent of Australian people then it's necessary for the department to actively engage with groups of people who have their heritage in those countries, and in this particular case I think it's very important that the department actively engage with members of the Myanmar diaspora. I think the view of the Australian people is very clear when it comes to the matter of the military coup in Myanmar. They are comfortable. They would like Australia to carefully consider the imposition of sanctions. In fact, I think time is quickly running out, and the imposition of carefully considered sanctions in regard to Myanmar and the military coup must now be the highest priority. I absolutely agree that our officials should be working in concert with our neighbours on these issues for a period—not indefinitely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to echo—amplify—the comments of former ambassador Nicholas Coppel, whom I had the pleasure of meeting many times on my travels to Myanmar. He is informed. He is a considered person. And I think his contribution by way of an opinion piece in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> was very well received in this country and in fact by members of the Myanmar community in our country. They think this matter is so critical to them, so important to them, that clear and decisive action is very important. I've listened to the contributions of others in this chamber. I've avidly read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of this particular committee inquiry thus far. I prosecuted the case at Senate estimates. Members of the Myanmar community, particularly in Perth but right around the country, can be assured that this is a matter that is very close to my heart. It is one that I will be pursuing, and I expect to have much more to say in coming weeks.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250362" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  This is a report on the inquiry of impact of seismic testing on fisheries and the marine environment. The inquiry established by the Greens looked into the impact of seismic testing on fisheries and on the marine environment, with particular reference to the body of science and research into the use of seismic testing, the regulation of seismic testing in both Commonwealth and state waters, and the approach taken to seismic testing internationally. I acknowledge the work and the passion of my Greens colleague Senator Whish-Wilson, who chaired the inquiry and who, like me, cares deeply about our precious marine environment and about the protection of our oceans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many submitters and witnesses shared their concerns about the ongoing risks of oil and gas exploration in our oceans. I want to acknowledge the submissions made to the inquiry and thank everyone for their contribution and their strong voices to protect our oceans and marine environment from harm. In particular, I want to acknowledge Save Our Coast, whose founder, Natasha Deen, I worked with closely in fighting oil and gas exploration off the coast of New South Wales, and also the Surfrider Foundation. It's because of the effort of people like Natasha in the community that PEP 11 is basically dead in the water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry made it clear the community does not want seismic testing. The hearings showed that big oil and gas are on one side of the debate, while multigenerational fishing families and communities who live by our beautiful and precious coastline are firmly on the other side. The inquiry heard from many in these communities who do not want our oceans turned into gas and oil fields. In addition to the intrinsic value and beauty of our coast and marine life, recreation and local fishing industries rely on healthy oceans. The rock lobster, oyster, scallop and blue fin tuna industries have all expressed grave concerns about the impacts of seismic testing, yet the federal government has refused to act decisively to rule it out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only will the oil and gas exploration off the coast damage our environment; if these projects actually go ahead, the drilling and burning of fossil fuels will accelerate the climate emergency we are already in. We know that the Liberals and Nationals—and the Nationals especially, under the helm of their resurrected leader, Barnaby Joyce—only care about their mates in the fossil fuel lobby, not the community, not the environment. We know that big oil and gas have deliberately not funded research on the effects of seismic testing on our oceans and marine environments because they know the results would be damaging. They have been operating in the dark, with no science to back their false claims that seismic testing does not cause harm to our marine animals. We know that it does. We know, from recent reports, that rock lobster populations are being impacted by seismic testing in the Bass Strait. The report rightly makes several recommendations that significant funding should be directed towards additional research to study the short-term, long-term and cumulative impacts of seismic testing on marine animals and the marine environment. It would be extraordinary for the government to continue handing out permits for seismic testing before more is known.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of New South Wales, communities along the coast are rightly up in arms at the prospect of their beloved oceans and coastline being damaged. They are strongly opposing plans to locate and extract fossil fuel from Port Stephens all along our magnificent coastline to Wollongong. Like the many communities who have put up fierce opposition to drilling in the Great Australian Bight, they have come together to protect our precious environment and push for a sustainable future. Our oceans and all who thrive by their shores depend on this. At the very least, the risk of irreversible damage posed by seismic testing demands a precautionary approach. It's vital that we stop this destructive offshore blasting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report recommends that the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources improve the current public consultation process to include all relevant stakeholders and implement mechanisms to enable greater consideration. In total, the report has made 19 expansive recommendations. In addition to these excellent recommendations, the Australian Greens have suggested another recommendation. The Greens recommend that the Australian government amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to allow for a ban on the issuance of any new permits for seismic testing for offshore oil and gas exploration. I hope that the government is listening to people who want to protect our oceans, to save our marine life, to protect our environment and to act on the climate crisis.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take note of Auditor-General's Report No. 45 of 2020-21, <span style="font-style:italic;">Management of Commonwealth fisheries</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Fisheries Management Authority</span>. Back in 2012-13, senators who were here would remember, we had the mother of all fights against two large industrial supertrawlers that were brought in by the Liberal Party to plunder Australia's waters. These trawlers had been dogged by controversy throughout their journeys around West Africa, especially, and other places, depleting the oceans' fisheries. We ended up banning those supertrawlers, which I think was a fantastic outcome. The Labor government at the time, under the then-fisheries minister, Mr Joe Ludwig, implemented a review of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. That review was called the Borthwick review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key findings of the Borthwick review was that AFMA, as the authority that manages fisheries in this country, needed to put much more weighting on ecological risk assessments in its overall framework of fisheries management. What this basically meant was that they needed to consider the environmental implications of fishing activities. That makes sense because, if we don't have a healthy ocean, of course our fisheries aren't going to be healthy. So the two things go hand in glove. Unfortunately I was very disappointed to read this Auditor-General's report before us today saying exactly the same thing. The Borthwick review made a number of very clear recommendations of even the legislative changes we needed to make to our fisheries management framework. Yet here today, in the executive summary of this report, it's clearly said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is unclear whether AFMA's ecological risk framework is appropriate. AFMA has documented its ecological risk management framework in the 2017 Guide to AFMA's Ecological Risk Management. AFMA has not met its requirement to re-assess ecological risk every five years. A plan to implement fishery management strategies, which incorporate ecological risk management and are subject to a five-year review period, has not been implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AFMA agreed that it hadn't met any of its own objectives in assessing the ecological risk of its management framework, and they agreed to do more work on this. It's certainly something that the Greens will be keeping a very close eye on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other recommendations in here. There are obviously some ticks of approval for AFMA, in certain areas, but I was also very interested in some of the economic objectives that AFMA set itself that haven't been met. For example:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Plans and strategies have not been reviewed in accordance with the relevant Commonwealth legislation and policy. Stakeholder engagement with recreational and Indigenous fishing stakeholders has been limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is very disappointing, because the recreational fishing sector was one of the sectors that drove the need to have better consultation and have their considerations taken into account in commercial fisheries as well. It also says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AFMA seeks to meet the requirement to maximise net economic returns by pursuing maximum economic yield for individual fisheries. Mechanisms to maximise economic yield are not mature and progress towards establishing maximum economic yield targets for individual fisheries has been slow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish on this note. I'm pleased to say, and to remind the chamber, that the Greens initiated a Senate inquiry recently, through the rural and regional affairs committee, to review—it's been 30 years—the quota management system in this country. The system was brought in in the 1990s. We have had extensive feedback from commercial fishing stakeholders around the country, especially for smaller struggling fisheries operators in places like King Island, off Tasmania, and other states around the country, that this fisheries management approach is not fit for purpose any longer, 30 years later. It needs a thorough review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly enough, the submissions to the committee have included a wide range of economists, scientists and experts all saying it's high time that this was reviewed. This goes hand in glove with some of the recommendations in this report from the Auditor-General. While it might be a little bit wonky to some, if we don't get fisheries management right in this country we're never going to have healthy oceans and we're never going to be able to sustain the fishing industry, the fishing operators all around this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have got to know some of these fishers very well, over the years. For example, I've been working with them recently on seismic testing, which my colleague Senator Faruqi has just given an excellent five-minute speech on. The fishing industry is very concerned about these kinds of activities, and as I've got to know them I've got to understand that many of them see themselves as the custodians of some of their fisheries. They admit that a lot of their practices over previous years, going back many generations, have been archaic. Let me tell you, they know that the ocean is changing. They totally understand that their livelihoods are at stake if we don't change the way we operate, and not just in our fisheries but if we don't tackle climate change and the climate emergency we find ourselves in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Charles Darwin, when he was on the voyage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Beagle</span>, had this love affair with giant kelp and he wrote extensively about it. I don't have the exact quote in front of me but he warned, in his writings, that if we were ever to lose giant kelp we would lose more biodiversity than in the richest terrestrial rainforests that he had encountered in Equatorial Guinea and up in Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and other places. Sadly, Tasmania has lost its giant kelp forests. Those habitats and ecosystems that were so important to fisheries have largely vanished from the east coast of Tasmania. Seagrasses around the nation are under pressure and vanishing. Thousands of kilometres of mangrove habitat has died back and vanished with warming oceans. And we've had some debate in this chamber today and during this week about the sad, tragic decline of the Great Barrier Reef. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fishers right around the country know what's going on in the ocean. They're aware of this. They would like to see climate action. They understand that governments play a critical role in regulating their industry, in stepping in and taking climate action, doing what is necessary to ensure that we've all got a healthy ocean, doing what is necessary to ensure the future of their intergenerational families that have been in the fishing industry for many years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this Auditor-General report is welcome. It complements the work that we're about to do on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. I look forward to seeing some significant reform in fisheries management in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979</span> to create a legislative framework to enable the negotiation of bilateral and multilateral "Designated International Agreements" allowing law enforcement and ASIO to access electronic information and communications data held in overseas countries.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill as amended by the Government also ensures "international designated agreements" must go through the usual treaty making processes, including review by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and be subject to disallowance by the Parliament. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As per PJCIS recommendations, the Bill as amended by the Government makes specific recognition of concerns around the death penalty by foreign partners given Australia's longstanding bipartisan opposition to the practice. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It notes the Minister cannot specify a designated agreement for the purpose of the Bill unless written assurance of the right to life has been given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Beyond these recommendations, the Government has also circulated amendments that clarify that the Security Appeals Division of the AAT includes the Deputy Presidents of the AAT, and clarify that Australian companies that have some presence in the United States cannot be subject to an Australian IPO sent to the United States. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment ensures that Australian law enforcement and ASIO cannot 'take advantage' of an Australian company's presence in the United States to use an IPO to gain access to information they would usually require an Australian warrant to be served on the Australian company.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As such, Labor recognises the immense importance of this legislation, and we will support it today with the passage of the appropriate Government amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, those opposite have questions to answer as to why exactly it has taken so long for us to get to this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The IPO Bill was introduced on 5 March 2020, and it was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security shortly thereafter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In referring the Bill to the PJCIS, then-Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said it was <span style="font-style:italic;">"vital that the bill be positioned to pass both Houses of the Parliament before the end of the 2020 Winter sittings."</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Minister also emphasised the urgency of the legislation in his media release in March 2020, saying, <span style="font-style:italic;">"Investigations of serious crimes such as terrorism and child exploitation are too important to be stalled, or even derailed, by outdated, cumbersome processes when evidence includes communication data held in a different country."</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we all know, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is an exemplar of what can be achieved in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was Bob Hawke's Labor Government that originally created the framework for Australia's bi-partisan compact on national security that still exists today through the work of the PJCIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I stress this: bipartisanship does not mean immediate agreement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rather, Australia's unique bipartisan compact on national security means a sober analysis of the policy and security questions before the parliament and eschewing partisan electoral calculations in favour of the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Federal governments of all persuasions have upheld the convention of this bipartisan compact and looked to the PJCIS for resolution of sensitive or complex national security matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the bipartisan compact that underpins the committee has been stretched and strained under this Morrison Government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government's decision to ignore the PJCIS' bi-partisan recommendations on the 'encryption laws' and ram the legislation through parliament at the end of 2018 was certainly a political fracture within the compact. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government further cracked the compact by refusing to facilitate passage of the PJCIS' amendments in early 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And we saw again this month how those opposite will twist and strain the PJCIS for political gain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCIS called for public submissions into this Bill to be received by early April last year and held three public hearings in May 2020, a report was not finalised for this legislation until 12 May 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's some twelve months after the first hearing was held, and nearly ten months after the deadline that Minister Dutton imposed on his own government to pass this "vital bill". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So, we have been told we must rush. And yet, our national security agencies are now waiting. Waiting on the Government. A chaotic Government, only interested in itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately, the PJCIS is a Government-controlled Committee, and Labor is not responsible for the speed with which the Committee works. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Make no mistake—the PJCIS is an extremely hard-working body. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee has completed 15 inquiries since the last election, and held over 100 meetings, hearings, briefings, and inspections in this period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But it is incumbent on the Government to set the priorities of the committee, and to ensure that vital Bills are given the appropriate treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the Committee did release its report in May of this year, it made 23 recommendations aimed largely at clarifying aspects of the proposed legislation and strengthening oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to stress that these were bipartisan recommendations—both Labor and Liberal members of the PJCIS supported these recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the appropriate amendments, the bipartisan recommendation of the Committee was to pass the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And so it came as quite a surprise when Mr Morrison decided to criticise Labor for holding up this bill in a press conference on 8 June 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is difficult to see how Labor could possibly be to blame for holding up a piece of legislation which it supported, particularly when that Bill has been before a Government-controlled committee for over a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, Labor hadn't heard anything from Mr Morrison's Government in relation to the Bill—until Mr Morrison sought to again politicise national security, and in turn created another 'stress test' for our bipartisan compact on national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Morrison has regularly jettisoned norms and protocols in this place in pursuit of his own political self-interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But what makes his most recent claim so galling is that, at the time he said it, his own Government had not responded to the PJCIS report, nor had it briefed its own party members on the legislation or circulated any amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unamended, the IPO Bill could see Australian-sourced information be used by foreign governments in death-penalty cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This was one of a number of issues in the legislation that required attention and clarity in relation to what is necessary and proportionate, including whether the powers were subject to appropriate oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Again, these recommendations were made by a bipartisan group—a 'small but informed parliamentary committee'—working without partisanship, in the best interests of our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a system that has been in place, in one form or another, since the days of the Hawke Government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But Scott Morrison is no Bob Hawke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He doesn't see this place as a vehicle to better the lives of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He sees it as a platform for his own personal gain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's why he is comfortable plumbing new depths in this space—because the norms of our democratic institutions are a secondary consideration for a Prime Minister who doesn't have a vision for this country beyond his own job description. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any person who would jeopardise the PJCIS in search of a soundbite is no friend of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to ensure our law enforcement and integrity bodies have access to the information that they need to keep us safe and uphold the laws of this country. Just as we need to ensure that oversight of this access is assured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have long supported this Bill, but as always, defer to the informed view of the PJCIS with regard to how it can be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And so we will support this legislation today, along with the Government's amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We reiterate, though, that Mr Morrison's politicking does not help to keep Australians safe—in fact it does the exact opposite. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To undermine the PJCIS and attempt to politicise its important work—to blatantly lie to the Australian people about who is responsible for delaying the passage of important national security legislation—is an extraordinary misstep. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is as clear as ever—Mr Morrison is not on your side.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill lacks the protections included under equivalent legislation in other countries that Australia might want to enter into an agreement with.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens want to make sure that this Bill provides strong safeguards with respect to matters such as the protection of human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is actually—at this stage—impossible to undertake a complete identification and assessment of the safeguards that will apply to the scheme set out in this Bill because this bill is so unfinished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not only has the government not given us enough time to consider the 47 pages of amendments they sent through at the last minute but it's impossible to tell with absolute certainty how the privacy and the rights of law-abiding people will be protected when this scheme is operational.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Also, noting that Administrative Appeals Tribunal members will have an important role to play in this Bill- even though a lot of them lack the independence required to properly fulfil the role of considering and issuing International Production Orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's common knowledge that the Tribunal is very politicised because it is being influenced through appointments that reflect political affiliation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That way Parliament can have immediate access to that agreement when considering whether to disallow regulations prescribing it as a designated international agreement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let's work together to ensure that the Parliament can effectively exercise its discretion to disallow designated international agreement regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let's give full legal certainty to agencies, by providing that these regulations commence after the disallowance period has ended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let's also ensure that international production orders relating to criminal law enforcement and control orders are only issued by judicial officers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That way we can provide greater substantive and perceived independence to the approval process.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, let's make sure that the ombudsman has all of the resources and powers necessary to provide full oversight of this scheme and that there are real penalties for breaches of power, policy, or law.</span>

                    </a>  The amendments on sheet 1200 simply implement an existing requirement of the Water Act to maintain a transparent register of water trades. This provision has been in the Water Act for 14 years. As Minister Dutton kindly pointed out in the House of Representatives debate this morning, this amendment has a solid legal basis. The pathetic excuse the Nationals gave that the states each have their own register actually supports our case for a basin-wide register. The Nationals have confirmed that there is not a basin-wide register. By taking this action, the ALP and the Liberals and their sellout sidekicks the Nationals are making it clear that they intend to pick and choose which aspects of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan they intend to follow. It's a bit like they're saying: 'We like this bit. Let's spend years stealing water from farmers, forcing up the price of water so the holdings of our friends are suddenly worth a fortune. But we hate this bit. We don't want anyone to know what we're doing.' On what legal basis are the Nationals, the Liberals and Labor doing this? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On the one hand you want to manage the Murray-Darling Basin, and on the other hand you've got members of your own government saying that South Australia doesn't need fresh water.

The Clerk says the motion on the medevac message allowed a short debate, but the point remains that 'put immediately' means without debate—that is, only statements by leave are in order—which is consistent with exactly what I said prior to adding the note about the medevac message. My apologies for that error. I assume, Senator Waters, your question is that the Senate dissent from my ruling on what 'put immediately' means.</span>

As I said, consideration of formal business has, over the 14 years of my time here, become one of the most divisive, dysfunctional and disorderly elements of the day. The process for formal motions was originally intended to allow the consideration of noncontroversial items, to allow consideration relating to the smooth running of the Senate. Instead, it has become a process where we have seen motions used for the purposes of race-baiting. We've seen motions that are engaging in the most sensitive of conscience vote issues. We've seen motions in relation to complex foreign policy matters. We've seen significant policy questions that, frankly, cannot be simplified into a few sentences, yet senators attempt to do so in putting such motions.</span>

As we know, the Senate and senators, particularly through the Procedure Committee, have long considered and debated ways to try to address the problems with the dysfunctionality of this element of the day. An attempt was made to limit parts of that. Unfortunately, the attempt to limit the number of motions in an effort to try to create a more orderly approach has only resulted in yet more dysfunction and disorder. So consideration has been ongoing in terms of how to achieve reform that will provide for greater order in the chamber whilst not limiting the ability of senators to make a stance and assay themselves. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly to this motion, and the opposition will be supporting it. This motion will deal with a part of the program that, as the Leader of the Government has outlined, has been dysfunctional and divisive every single day that I have been in this place, and it is getting worse. It is also an issue that's been on the agenda of the procedure committee, for discussion and reform, for the entire time I've been in this place, because it constantly gets raised as a dysfunctional and divisive part of the program that doesn't work. This proposal actually gives more senators the opportunity to speak—60 new speaking spots a week—and senators have unlimited opportunity to put in motions. These are 60 spots to raise issues on behalf of your community or issues that matter to you, on a daily basis, that can be raised in this chamber and dealt with.</span>

                  </a>  I hear the interjections, 'But there are no votes.' That goes to the issue of how this part of the program has been used. Formal business was used initially for motions that could be agreed across the chamber and put without debate. That was the origin of it. It has been used for the opposite effect, for the entire time I've been in this place. It has been used for motions that are complex, that are complicated and that are often deeply felt by senators in this place. And senators in this place are asked—without the opportunity to debate, without the opportunity to discuss—to get into either a yes or a no camp, without it even being explained why they're going there. Then that is weaponised, outside of this place, to attack other senators. That is exactly what it's about, and we know that's why you're angry. We know that you're angry because the issue of the vote is what you treasure the most—as opposed to genuinely raising issues, having the opportunity to speak, which is being provided by this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what's happening here. We have more spots for speaking. More spots for backbenchers who might not have that opportunity to speak are now being provided to people. We have tried, over the past year, since the other reforms came in, to have a sensible way forward on motions. We have raised it. I have raised it repeatedly with people. We have now had senators denying formality to anyone who wants to move a motion—gagging people, refusing them the right to move motions. That's where we are now. This deals with that, and gives every opportunity for every senator to actually speak and raise their issue. What it doesn't do is force people to vote yes or no on things that are often contested and complicated and that require debate. It is a dysfunctional part of this program. This temporary order looks to address that, and we look forward to working with parties across the chamber on its implementation. If it doesn't work, it can be reconsidered, but this is the most sensible way forward at this point in time. It's a temporary order, and, again, the extension of friendship and support goes out to everyone, to try to make this work as best as possible—because it hasn't to date. </span>

That's plain and simple. This complicated motion came in at 4.45 pm. It's now 5.25 pm. We haven't had time to properly read this. We agreed in the Procedure Committee that this proposal would go out for comment to senators. Guess when it went out? Yesterday morning. Then, yesterday afternoon, what happened? Senator Duniam came in with a handwritten note saying he will bring in a proposal tomorrow to deal with motions. We came in this morning—no motion, nothing. They were still making it up. Then what happened? We got in at 4.45 pm and there was the motion, the motion where the majors gang up to silence the crossbench. That is outrageous. They know that very well. Labor have already been absenting themselves from the chamber when they can't make a decision on these motions. They disappear out the door because they don't want to be held accountable by the electorate. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some of the things that have been achieved through motions: the disability royal commission; the banking royal commission; action on petrol sniffing. Those are the sorts of things that have been achieved through using motions, because that is how you get pressure on the government and pressure on the opposition—whoever is in government. This has happened on both sides of the chamber, when both the major parties have been in government. They don't want to be held accountable, and that's what this is about, folks. For those listening out there, these two major parties do not want to be held accountable. </span>

By bringing motions into this place, we achieved the banking royal commission. We brought motions into this place for a long time on violence and abuse against disabled people and veterans. We wouldn't have got action if we hadn't been able to bring those motions to this chamber. </span>
              </p>

We were supposed to be considering this at the end of the first sitting week in August. But what the government and the opposition—the so-called opposition—want to do is to deal with it now, in the dying hours of the last week of sitting in June. They think that everyone will forget before we get back here in August. We're not going to forget it. We're going to make sure the public remember what these two parties are doing to democracy in this country by ramming this through in the last hours of the last sitting day of the winter session. It is outrageous. </span>

I've come to realise, over many years of listening to governments in this country, that that word is used to misrepresent what is going to happen. It implies it is good for us all. It is not. It is a misrepresentation. The second point I make is: how can we assess the feelings of our constituents and then not express them here anymore? The government does not want to assess, and neither do the Labor party, the feelings of our constituents. The third point I want to make is that we've had no notice on this, and there is control. That's what this is about: control. And, always, beneath control there is fear. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't like what happened with formal motions. Our response was not to run away, not to shut down, but to stand up and speak out. Even though it was only one minute, that's what we've done. We spoke. We held people accountable. It doesn't matter whether it's the Greens and we disagreed or agreed with them; we had the guts to speak up. The core issue that's driving this is decades of weak governance and no accountability, and this change continues that. We will continue to tell the truth and calmly speak up and rely on data, and round you lot up.</span>

I am disappointed that very little notice was given for this and I do point out that we are gagged, in this debate, in a sequence of events where we are also gagged on bills—71 bills in the 37 days that Senator Birmingham has been Leader of the Government in the Senate. All of this is eating away at democracy. I will point out, on the motion that has been moved, one thing is absent that needs to be fixed—that is, the ability to test the Senate on questions of importance—and I think we need to rethink that in the context of moving forward.</span>

A right to speak does not extend to a right to force others to vote while being denied that very opportunity. Are there any other contributions to the debate? We have 2½ minutes remaining.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgets are all about choices. The government's latest budget completely misses the opportunity to address the growing inequality and poverty in our community. In fact, it works to further entrench it. Instead of ensuring everyone has enough to live a good life, ensuring people's wellbeing, the government has decided to spend $62 billion a year in handouts to big corporations and billionaires; $8.5 billion in tax rorts for property investors, with no new funding for public housing and community housing; $213 million and counting on compliance measures for people on income support; and $42 million to further entrench the cashless debit card. The budget should be used to address long-term problems as well as the most immediate issues. Inequality is increasing, wages have flatlined, work is more insecure and the cost of living keeps going up. Far too many Australians are living in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is in the middle of a housing crisis. In a wealthy country like Australia, no-one should be without a roof over their head. Instead, there are 116,000 people sleeping rough in Australia every night and even more experiencing extreme housing stress, and there are many people couch surfing. This budget further strengthens a housing system that actively impoverishes people and makes inequality worse. Instead of guaranteeing everyone's right to a safe home, the government has given $8.5 billion in tax breaks to wealthy investors and property speculators in this budget. Despite the housing crisis, this budget has not allocated any new funds for public or community housing. Public housing should be universally accessible so that no-one is living without a roof over their head.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing prices and rents have skyrocketed, particularly during the pandemic, squeezing the most vulnerable into extreme housing stress and insecurity. Home ownership is increasingly out of reach for a majority of young people in this country. In Perth, in my home state of Western Australia, the medium rent is 460 bucks a week. This is not even close to being affordable for someone on income support, particularly when the payment is $44 a day, or for someone working at the minimum wage, with a yearly income of $38,480 a year. This budget gives $62 billion a year in subsidies to billionaires and big corporations, but the government says there's not enough money to increase JobSeeker to $80 a day, which we know is the level that would lift people out of poverty and ensure they're not condemned to poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the height of the pandemic the government acknowledged that the rate of the JobSeeker payment was inadequate and chose to immediately increase the payment to above the poverty line with the introduction of the COVID supplement. This one decision immediately lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty. They knew they had to do that to ensure that people weren't living in poverty during the pandemic lockdown. It had a remarkable impact on the lives of people receiving income support payments. People were able to eat regular meals, pay off existing debts, save for education and training and go to the dentist—things that other people take for granted. When you're living on $44 a day you can't afford to go to the dentist or afford the essential medications—they were putting it off because they simply couldn't afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disgrace that this government does not significantly increase the JobSeeker payment to ensure that millions of Australians are not living in poverty. It must be acknowledged that people on the disability support pension and carers were cruelly excluded from the COVID supplement, a point the Greens raised in this chamber many times. Despite all evidence that expenses for disabled people and carers increased in the pandemic, they were simply left out from receiving extra assistance. This is despite the government knowing very well that disabled people face additional costs of living generally. That is very clear in work that AFDO has done on the cost of a disabled person's living expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite paying more for health care, medical supplies, PPE, transport and utility bills, disabled people and carers are still struggling to make ends meet. There is nothing in this budget to help alleviate these costs. As quickly as the COVID supplement was introduced, it was then taken away. Once again, people looking for work, students and single parents are forced to live below the poverty line. This is a choice by this government to drop those people back below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People on income support payments have gone back to regularly skipping meals and missing their medications to try and keep a roof over their heads. They have articulated all those things so many times to us through various inquiries. It has been spoken about in this chamber. That's the reality for people looking for work. And this government does not care. They don't care for the consequences. This has been their policy choice. Half of all households in Australia who receive parenting payments live in poverty, with single mothers—because that's the majority of single parents by far; they're clearly overrepresented in this group—being particularly at risk of financial stress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should also be noted that parents, when their youngest child turns eight, are put on to the lower rate of the JobSeeker payment. That's a policy that has still not been reversed despite its adverse consequences and despite the data clearly showing an increase in poverty for single parents when those changes were made. The changes were made and came into effect after the decision of the Howard government and after the decision of the Gillard government to move the grandfathered cohort on to the then Newstart payment, now JobSeeker payment. This forces parents into poverty, and it significantly undermines their caring work. We know that poverty is a barrier to finding work. There are more than 1.1 million Australian children in homes where an income support payment is the main source of income. These children live in poverty. There is nothing in this budget to reduce this shameful statistic. Further, the government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme for single parents will help very few single parents. How does the government expect single parents to save enough money to purchase a house when they are living in poverty? There is no greater evidence that the government is out of touch than this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our aged-care system is in crisis. While additional resources were committed to aged care, they were not enough to address the dire need for reform and to do the job properly. This budget does not address fundamental workforce issues. Nor does it properly fund the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Older Australians and aged-care workers continue to suffer because of poor conditions and a lack of regulation, problems this government has allowed to fester. Aged care needs total reform, and the government is neither acting with the urgency that is required nor committing the funds necessary. We have an ageing population, and we don't have the workforce to keep up. No money was committed in this budget to increasing wages for the aged-care workforce. If the government were genuinely committed to addressing this issue and offering more hours of care, they would have committed, in this budget, the money for an increase in wages. They wouldn't hide behind the fair-work case. They know very well that this is needed. Some workers in aged care are working on very low wages. We need to ensure that our aged-care workforce and our caring workforce is paid properly. A sustained commitment to the care sector is fundamental to guaranteeing access to essential services for all, regardless of their income or where they live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget takes away from employment services. Australia is one of the lowest spenders in the OECD on employment services. The pandemic has resulted in hundreds of thousands more people accessing income support, but this government still can't give up on its obsession with making savings out of our social safety net. With more than 50 per cent of jobseekers on the payment for more than two years, this also is urgent. We need to be putting more resources into employment services, not punishing people through ramping up mutual obligations. There is very little in the budget to help long-term unemployed people find work. Instead, the budget provides $213 million to strengthen so-called mutual obligations. This is more money to punish, threaten and bully people who are looking for work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that continues the ongoing disdain this government has for people doing it tough—people on income support, older Australians, young people, single parents and disabled people. In budget after budget, this government has failed to address entrenched poverty. Instead, it expects charities and the not-for-profit sector, which are under increasing strain, to pick up the slack, while, on the other hand, it tries to gag them further using ACNC governance standard 3. A strong social safety net and properly funded public services are the bedrock of ensuring equality and opportunity for everyone. Budgets should prioritise this. A budget for the community, rather than billionaires, would invest in reducing poverty.</span>

I would go further. This budget leaves the whole country behind, and that means it leaves everyone behind. There have been massive increases in debt in the last 12 months, without the necessary objective data to underpin them. That shows, yet again, poor governance of our country. In Senate estimates, I discussed with the chief medical officer and the secretary of the health department the seven essential components of a plan for managing a virus. The federal government is addressing one; the state governments are addressing another—that's it—and they have both been addressed poorly.</span>

The productive capacity of our country has been declining considerably since 1944 and, in fact, since 1923, if we want to get into basics—but that's for another day. Let's look at the most important part of productive capacity—the human asset, our people. Look at education, because it's the future leaders of this country who will determine the future productive capacity, as well as us determining that capacity today. We have declining scores in education. Reading and writing, mathematics and science—declining. By world standards, we are falling well behind in the core aspects of education but we devote plenty of resources, plenty of time, plenty of energy to teaching kids—misleading kids—about gender fluidity, critical race theory, non-gendered language and a national curriculum that the government forks out money for yet cannot control. That's what has been told to us by the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need charter schools. We need parents to have more say in the running of their schools, and principals to have more say in the running of their schools; parents to control what values are passed on; and parents to decide whether or not their children will be taught about gender fluidity. I want to compliment Mark Latham in the New South Wales parliament and my colleague Senator Pauline Hanson for the bills they are introducing and evaluating right now to restore values and common sense to education. I note that Singapore, Japan and Korea have really moved ahead in recent years, as has Taiwan. They all have solid basic education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happened to apprenticeships in this country? Senator Lines moved a motion today with regard to apprenticeships sadly lacking in WA. Senator Hanson has proudly introduced an apprenticeship scheme that the government has taken and refurbished and expanded, such is the success of her suggestion on apprenticeships. What has happened to universities? They followed our primary schools and high schools in becoming more woke and driven by anything but education. As for university education, it is now just pushing an ideology. Our TAFE systems have fallen into disrepair; our trades qualifications are falling into disrepair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's move on, then, to the workplace. The Fair Work Act is an abomination. It is about that thick in pages printed. It destroys the employer-employee relationship, which is essential for productive capacity. It is difficult for anyone, an employee or a small businesses employer, who doesn't have access to lawyers and consultants and HR practitioners to work their way through that. How can they possibly be held accountable for that relationship when they can't even understand it and never will understand it, not because of lack of intelligence but because of lack of time and surely being overwhelmed? Again, just like education, this is poor governance to get into this state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go to energy, arguably the most critical in material resources because energy has determined the competitiveness of every country. Under President Trump, America reversed the decline in its competitiveness because it reversed its increasing energy prices and it started to decrease its energy prices again. America became more competitive against its competitors and blossomed because of that. President Trump created more jobs than any president in history because of that and because he cut away regulations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government and its predecessors have fiddled the Renewable Energy Target, destroying our baseload coal-fired power stations, our grid. The network costs are destroying our grid, making it unaffordable. Retail sectors of electricity are just a fabrication. The National Electricity Market is now a national electricity racket. It's not a market at all; it's a bureaucracy that's interfered with and manipulated by bureaucrats looking after vested interests. Then we see privatisation. The Queensland Labor government is taking about $1½ billion every year from people who use electricity—businesses, small businesses and families—and that is now a tax. We have taxes on electricity. Why is it that the Chinese can produce electricity and sell it for one-third the cost of electricity sold in this country when they use the same coal as we do? They take it thousands of kilometres, burn it and sell the coal-fired power to their consumers and we sell it for three times as much because of regulations that come out of both sides of this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we look at water. The Murray-Darling Basin has been gutted. Communities have been gutted. Regions have been gutted. And nothing is happening about it. Today we passed an amendment to restore compliance with the law, the Water Act of 2007, with regard to water trading. It was supported by the Labor Party but denied by the Liberals and Nationals. They don't want to comply with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It went down to the lower house and Labor changed and sent it back here, in cahoots with the Liberals and Nationals. That will continue to destroy water allocations in our country because it will continue the corruption and the likely—I'm very confident in saying this—criminal activity going on in the Murray-Darling Basin with regard to abuse of water trading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we see property rights, which are fundamental to running a farm or a business. They were capriciously stolen under the Howard-Anderson government in 1996 and then progressively by Labor premiers from Queensland and New South Wales, jumping on the bandwagon to steal farmers' property rights. Why? To comply with the United Nations Kyoto protocol of 1996—that's why. Farmers have lost the value of their land. We see that extended in Queensland, for example, by the Queensland state government, relying on bogus claims about the reef to lock up land. We then see the federal government enacting carbon farming, where vast tracks of good farmland are laid waste, abandoned and taken over by feral animals and noxious weeds. There are costs to managing them as they spread around the country and fall on their neighbours' properties. This is another example of poor governance. There's a lack of infrastructure in water. The Bradfield scheme is crying out for investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go to the most destructive system of all in our country, the Australian taxation system. In 1996 and 2010, Jim Killaly was the deputy commissioner of taxation for large companies and international matters. He said on both occasions—1996 and 2010—that 90 per cent of Australia's large companies are foreign owned and, since 1953, have paid little or no company tax. They use our resources, people, assets, defence forces, police forces and education system and pay nothing in return and just take. The Japanese, by comparison, have in their large companies 2.5 per cent foreign owned. The American and the British figures are about 12.5 per cent. Who pays for these foreign companies to use our assets and to make money without paying company tax? The people of Australia pay for that through families paying taxes, individuals paying taxes, small businesses paying taxes and some large Australian come companies paying 30 per cent against their multinational competitors who don't have to pay that. How can we possibly compete? Then we found out in the late 1990s and early 2000s—and I've asked the Parliamentary Library to update this figure—that a person on an average income in this country pays 68 per cent of their income to government. Housing is not our largest expenditure in life; government is, through taxes, rates, fees, levies, chargers, supercharges and special charges. Joe Hockey admitted when he was Treasurer that 50 per cent of a person's income is taken in tax. He said people work from January through to the end of June for government and then they keep what's left. The actual figure, when you take in government charges, rates, levies and fees as well, is 68 per cent, which means that someone on the average income is working from Monday to mid-morning Thursday to pay for government. Then they have what's left, the two-thirds of Thursday and Friday, to pay for their entire life: their retirement, their education, their food, their shelter, their car, their transport, their entertainment. That is not fair, and it shows poor governance. I haven't got time now to talk about attempts to reform taxation, but both parties, both the tired old parties, have shown a reluctance to invest energy and political will and sheer guts in tackling—and they lack the integrity to tackle—comprehensive tax reform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned infrastructure a minute ago. What about projects like the Richmond agricultural project? What about the irrigation project up in Hughenden? What about things like Iron Boomerang, which would transform our country and make it the most cost-effective and largest producer of steel, and give us enormous security for manufacturing and for our defence? Then we have things that tap into that Iron Boomerang—things like an inland rail that's being destroyed by the Liberal-National government, an inland rail that is sucking up resources and coming up with something that will be far worse than the existing installations, especially when we consider the blowout in the cost. Again, it's a lack of data, a lack of sound planning. An inland rail and a proper route through to Gladstone would be part, then, of a proper national rail circuit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy President, I submit to you these points that show and prove that the government here has not only left the poor behind, as Senator Siewert points out; the government has put additional burdens on the poor, the government has put a regressive tax on the poor in terms of energy prices. Energy prices are increasing alarmingly, and the poor have to pay a higher and higher and higher proportion of their income on a fundamental, which is energy. And then the poor pay for it because they lose their jobs when our manufacturing jobs and some of our agricultural and agricultural processing jobs are exported to China, which uses our raw materials—gas and coal—to produce electricity far more cheaply than we sell it for in our own country. So we're losing out entirely and we lose out in the diminishing of our defence security. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I certainly agree with Senator Siewert that the Morrison government's 2021-22 budget has left people on low incomes behind. It has left people right across the country behind. It has left Australia behind. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  In the time remaining, I will make some comments about the budget. I think the budget was a good opportunity for Australians to see the multifaceted economic plan that we have. Of course, this starts with being a competitive economy, because an economy that is outward looking like Australia's—we're not isolationist; we're not trying to run a rust-bucket economy—needs to be competitive. We need to be able to attract foreign investment. Foreign investment is something that we have relied upon since the First Fleet. Being a dynamic, open, modern economy, there are many measures to improve our competitive position. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget, there was the announcement that Australia will have a patent box system. There was an announcement that we would modernise the tax residency rules. There was an announcement that we would establish an ATO-style concierge service to attract and win that foreign investment. Because of some of the disruption in our region, most particularly in Hong Kong, there are more opportunities for Australia to capture growth from the region, but we can only capture that growth if we are dynamic and competitive. These measures in the budget do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only in the last few weeks, the G7 met, and there's been a discussion about having a minimum company tax rate. As this chamber knows, there have been many attempts to try and cut the headline tax rate, for good reason, but they have not been successful. In an era of lower-tax competition, it is important that Australia is right on the cutting edge in terms of having the sorts of tax schemes and regulatory frameworks which are really going to drive that investment. We need foreign investment because, for all that people come into this chamber and say how much they love superannuation, superannuation does not fund Australian companies. If you want jobs, you need to get money going into companies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing that our budget does is gets taxes down. It obviously builds on our prior budget, which reduced the tax rate for small companies with turnovers of under $50 million. In this budget, we extend the instant asset write-off. For small businesses, whether they're making canoes or making coffees, their ability to access the instant asset write-off has been a real boon because it has improved significantly the ability of a business to make a capital investment. It's effectively saying you can expense your capital investment, which is a very good thing. It not only stimulates the economy but it also effectively delivers an asset to that small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also extended the temporary loss carry-back, which means that, if companies have paid tax in a prior tax year, they can offset that against a loss, which gives them a direct refund. The philosophy here is that the government has no money of its own. All the money the government has to play with it taxes from individuals, so the idea of the government giving tax back to people and back to companies is a very sound principle. One thing we understand well and truly on this side of the Senate is that most small businesses are just people who have an idea who are running a company. They could be running a sole tradership. Whatever we can do to support those businesses around the country is very important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third element is providing more flexibility for retirees, because we think that people should be able to downsize their houses easily, voluntarily contribute more to super if they want to, and use their super to purchase a first home in certain circumstances. It is probably well known that I think we should be extending that further, but the budget does provide a measure that allows Australians to take $50,000 from their super—it has to be voluntary contributions—to use for a first home. We've always believed in homeownership on this side of the Senate, always, because having a home not only gives you a sense of security; it also gives you a place to build a family and it gives you a greater stake in society. We're always looking for ways to boost homeownership, and there are now more first home buyers in the market than there has been at any time over the last 10 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget makes Australia more competitive. It gets taxes down, which is great, and it provides more flexibility in that very rigid superannuation space, which has been dominated by the dreaded vested interests for far too long. We look forward to people having more control of their money in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I rise this evening to pay tribute to members of the Australian Vietnamese community in my home state of Queensland. On 30 April 2021, I had the great honour of attending the 46th commemoration at Freedom Place, Inala, in my home state of Queensland, of the fall of Saigon, which occurred on 30 April 1975. It was a very moving occasion. There are three points I'd like to make in relation to that event. First, I'd like to, on the record, pay tribute to all those veterans of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam who fought for freedom against the communists in their homeland. They fought with great courage in the force of overwhelming opposition, at a time when support from previous allies had been withdrawn. I pay tribute to each and every one of those veterans who was in attendance on that day. It was a great honour to share that day with each and every one of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I give thanks for the fact that so many of those veterans, their families and their descendants found their way to our beautiful country of Australia. The Australian Vietnamese community have made an outstanding contribution to this country. We should always remember that not only did they find Australia but Australia found them. They're now part of the modern Australian story. I pay tribute to that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last point I want to make, and perhaps the most moving aspect of the commemoration day, is that senior members of the Australian Vietnamese community raised with me a grave injustice. That injustice is the fact that national servicemen from Australia who performed their duty when called upon to serve our country but who had served in Vietnam for less than 181 days were denied the recognition of the Republic of Vietnam medal for their service. That has caused great distress to some 3,000 national servicemen. When this matter was raised with me, what was particularly moving was that those veterans of the army of the Republic of Vietnam, their descendants and families, so passionately believe that those Australian national servicemen should be given that recognition. Forty-six years after the fall of Saigon, the Australian Vietnamese community so passionately wants the service of those Australian national servicemen, who did their duty when called upon by their country, to be recognised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not within my power to give or grant that recognition. If it were, I would gladly do it. But the one thing I would say to each and every one of those 3,000 national servicemen—who served their country in the most difficult of circumstances in perhaps the most controversial of armed conflicts this country has ever engaged in—is that your duty, your courage and the sacrifice that each one of you made in serving your country and dealing with the aftermath is greatly appreciated and honoured by our Australian Vietnamese community. It will never, ever be forgotten.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I rise tonight to speak following the passing of an outstanding South Australian, James Richard Crawford AC, Judge of the International Court of Justice. Judge Crawford died on 31 May 2021 at the age of 72. With his passing our nation has lost one of its most influential scholars and jurists on the international stage. I note that there was a flood of tributes to the man and his work when news of his passing became public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I tender my profound sympathies to his family and many friends throughout the Australian and international community as well as the many people who have been influenced by his scholarship and jurisprudence. I have the pleasure of knowing one of his daughters, Rebecca Huntley, whose incisive mind gives some hint of her kin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">James Crawford was educated locally at Brighton High School, as it was then known, and at the University of Adelaide. After completing his doctorate in international law at Oxford, Judge Crawford returned to Adelaide to launch an academic career as a lecturer in international and constitutional law. This, in turn, took him to distinguished appointments at Sydney University and then Cambridge. Judge Crawford loved the intellectual rigour of academic life, but he was not satisfied with it. He knew that theory was nothing without application, and he was determined that his career would be uncloistered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He wrote landmark texts, most notably <span style="font-style:italic;">The Creation of States in International Law</span>, setting out the most elemental and profound concepts underpinning international jurisprudence, such as: 'What is a state?' and 'What does it mean to have sovereignty?' He took that work a giant leap further when he was commissioned to the UN International Law Commission to write the articles on the responsibilities of states for internationally wrongful acts, a project which had eluded his predecessors for some five decades. He completed it in five years. These articles provide the framework for state accountability and consequences for breaches in international law. It's little wonder that, in its obituary, the Cambridge Faculty of Law said he was 'a towering figure in international law' whose 'work is unparalleled'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an advocate, James Crawford served as senior counsel, counsel or co-counsel in some 30 contentious and advisory proceedings before the court. These internationally significant cases included representing Australia against Portugal in the East Timor case; the legality of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence; and the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. My colleague the honourable Mark Dreyfus QC MP recalled that, as Attorney-General, he had the great fortune to work with Justice Crawford preparing for and arguing Australia's successful case against Japan's unlawful whaling program before the International Court of Justice in July 2013. Mr Dreyfus described Judge Crawford as one of Australia's finest ever legal minds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, James Crawford commenced tenure as one of the International Court of Justice's 15 judges. He was only the second Australian to have ever been elected to the court, and the first for nearly 50 years. He approached this work following the dictum that had served him throughout his career. He was committed to international law as an open system—a practical tool for the resolution of apparently intractable international problems. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crawford's work broke new ground at home and abroad, and he is most famous for his work in international law, but he was also the commissioner in charge of a 1986 report by the Australian Law Reform Commission titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ecognition of Aboriginal customary laws</span>. That report is now considered one of the foundations of the Mabo decision that recognised native title. I was moved to read Judge Crawford's words, 'From a personal point of view, it is the biggest piece of work I've ever done.' It reminds us that there is no greater contribution to make to this country than to our national reconciliation, and it underscores how both on our shores and abroad James Crawford dedicated his life's work to helping shape an open and fair system of laws to serve our common humanity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I end by expressing again my deepest sympathy to Rebecca and to all of Judge Crawford's family and friends. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  Yesterday I had the privilege of addressing a rally outside Parliament House. It was a rally organised by many members of the Chinese diaspora in Australia. They were rallying to call on the Australian government to boycott the Beijing Olympics. There is no doubt that being given the privilege of hosting an Olympic Games provides great prestige and honour. It allows the government to showcase itself to the rest of the world and also domestically. It has the potential to be of great propaganda value for a particular regime. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking to the regime of which speak—namely, the dictatorship in China—we've got to ask a few fundamental questions. Those questions revolve around the question: is this dictatorship, with all its egregious human rights abuses, worthy of hosting an Olympic Games? If the International Olympic Committee determines it is so worthy, then the question needs to be asked: what should Australia do in that regard? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my very strong view that a boycott of some form or another should be applied. The reason is quite simple. Might I say that, while it is my view, it was also the view expressed by the substantial crowd of the Chinese diaspora outside Parliament House yesterday. The human rights abuses are egregious. They're there for all to see. In Hong Kong, there are the pro-democracy Hongkongers being brutally dealt with by the regime, on the back of the regime ripping up an international agreement that it signed with the United Kingdom and that was sanctioned by the United Nations. This showed a complete disregard for international law and international agreements and for abiding by their own agreements that they had signed off on. More importantly, it showed a complete disregard for the human rights of its own citizens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then move to the Chinese mainland proper. What do we see? We see house Christians being persecuted, Falun Gong practitioners being persecuted, Uighurs being persecuted—one million of them in concentration camps—forced sterilisation and slave labour. There are land grabs in the South China Sea islands. The list goes on and on. There are cyberattacks that are emanating from China. In relation to the Falun Gong, there is very well established forced organ harvesting against the practitioners of that particular belief system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world should not stand idly by and say, 'We will turn a blind eye to these egregious human rights abuses,' and say that the Olympics can go on as though there's nothing to be seen in China. We are dealing with a brutal, belligerent regime that has no regard for its international obligations, be it with the United Kingdom over Hong Kong or with Australia over our barley or wine trade or in relation to intellectual property rights. The list goes on and on. I simply say to the people of Australia and to my own government: it is worthy of consideration to boycott the Olympics in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have started a petition to entice Australians to give voice to that view should they be so minded. To access the petition, Australians can go online to the website change.org and search the words 'Abetz Olympics' to find the petition, which they can then sign. I would urge all my fellow Australians that have a genuine heart and concern for their fellow human beings suffering under the brutal regime in China to sign the petition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, and following on from some of my questions during the recent Senate estimates hearings, I ask again: when is a charity not a charity? I'm talking about the business known as the RSPCA. RSPCA Australia is a body originally set up to provide for animals needing assistance and protection from cruelty and neglect, a worthy notion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This organisation has established other networked but separate businesses in Australia, including RSPCA Queensland and other state based organisations. As businesses, these organisations are doing very well. For example, RSPCA Queensland's financial results for the year to June 2020 reveal a surplus of $8.7 million during what was described as 'a challenging year'. This included a $4 million grant from the federal government, taxpayers' money. Revenue for that period was over $58 million. This is a multimillion dollar business based on what we are told is a charitable, not-for-profit business that enjoys tax-free status. It's not generally known in the community that much of the revenue is gained from seizing animals from their owners under the ruse of falsely claiming that the animals are not being treated appropriately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A common feature of the RSPCA's approach involves the RSPCA harassing owners who appear to have fewer means and lack the ability to challenge the RSPCA in court. Inspectors seize healthy animals of high quality and worth to sell on the open market even where there is no evidence of abuse or neglect and owners are supported by evidence from their own vets. Purebred animals have been seized and sold for several thousands of dollars each. Pregnant animals have been taken and whole litters sold with no compensation paid to the owners. Puppies are particularly at risk of seizure. RSPCA inspectors, who organise the seizures, often act as prosecutors and also witnesses in the Magistrates Court. Surely this is an abuse of process and represents a conflict of interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Plea bargains are often offered to have an animal returned. They say, 'If you pay a large amount of money to the RSPCA, you may have your animal returned; if you do not pay us, we will kill your animal or sell it to someone else.' These sums demanded by the RSPCA are not insignificant. I'm aware of demands in excess of $40,000 to have animals returned. If the RSPCA are challenged and taken to court, owners are stung for ongoing caring costs, where the cases are deliberately dragged out to extend and increase the bills being demanded by RSPCA inspectors to care for the animals. These actions taken by the RSPCA are arguably criminal and must be challenged and investigated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hold considerable evidence of everything I've said today, and I am receiving new complaints on a daily basis from around Australia about outrageous actions of RSPCA inspectors. I've got complaints from vets, pet shop owners, registered breeders and many animal and pet owners. They all say that inspectors lie in court and harass owners. I've been told by a vet that one of his clients, an elderly man, owned a much-loved old dog that slept at his owner's bedside. The dog was blind in both eyes, and, under the vet's care, had a known but treated heart murmur—and was seized by the RSPCA. The RSPCA held the dog for two months, at high cost, and then operated on it to remove its eyes. The poor old dog died under the anaesthetic when its heart failed. The old man's heart was broken, as his dog was taken unnecessarily and died unnecessarily, yet no compensation was paid. The RSPCA then told other pet owners not to use that vet, as retribution, when he complained on behalf of the old man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another practice to put further pressure on owners to give their animals to the RSPCA is to charge family members as co-defendants in the alleged offences of people failing to care for their animals. This is a current practice. The RSPCA's role as a regulator and genuine protector must be severed from the commercial functions of the organisation to avoid the currently existing conflict of interest. The RSPCA was set up for genuine charitable purposes, yet sections of this organisation have gone rogue and must be stopped from stealing animals and oppressing genuine caring animal owners. It is the RSPCA behaving like a charity? Resoundingly no.</span>
