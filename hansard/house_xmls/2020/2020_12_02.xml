                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 6) Bill 2020 makes a number of technical amendments to clarify the operation of a number of laws and provide greater flexibility for Australians accessing the existing full expensing, backing business investment and consumer data right regimes. It also removes support for charitable institutions who fail to take reasonable steps to participate in the National Redress Scheme for institutional child sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, schedule 1 to the bill introduces an alternative test for accessing the temporary full expensing measure announced in the budget. This alternative test will allow eligible businesses who have less than $5 billion in statutory and ordinary income (excluding non-assessable non-exempt income) in the 2018-19 or 2019-20 income year to access temporary full expensing. This alternative test targets Australian businesses that have a track record of investing in Australia but could not qualify under the existing test as their turnover was aggregated with an overseas parent or affiliate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that the integrity rules associated with this extension operate as intended, Schedule 1 includes a number of clarifications to the tax law. For firms that qualify for full expensing under the alternative test, certain classes of assets are excluded, and this exclusion will apply to assets made available to a related party or a foreign entity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments importantly provide businesses with more flexibility by allowing those businesses to opt out of full expensing and the backing business investment on an asset-by-asset basis as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Competition and Consumers Act to better enable the consumer data right to grow in a way that is coordinated, accessible and secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will consolidate key consumer data right policy functions to improve coordination of the ongoing expansion and operation of the regime. They will also clarify the ways in which digital businesses accredited to use the consumer data right are able to employ agents to assist in providing services to their consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 to the bill amends the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission Act to encourage charities that may have been responsible for past institutional child sexual abuse to participate in the National Redress Scheme for institutional child sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will amend the definition of basic religious charity (BRC) to remove a religious institution's eligibility to be classified as a basic religious charity if it has a claim against it under the Redress Scheme, and does not join the Redress Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A basic religious charity that fails to take reasonable steps to participate in the Redress Scheme would be subject to existing compliance powers, including deregistration. Deregistration would result in the entity losing access to a suite of Commonwealth benefits and concessions, including tax concessions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is consistent with the public's expectation that generous support from the Commonwealth by way of charitable tax concessions should not be provided to institutions who fail to fulfil their moral obligation to survivors of child sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments further the government's commitment to the care and maintenance of Treasury laws and will make it easier for Australians to comply with current laws.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces a Serious Incident Response Scheme that will respond to, and take steps to prevent, the incidence of abuse and neglect of older Australians in residential aged care. This includes those receiving flexible care delivered in a residential aged-care setting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission's report on elder abuse, this bill will introduce a scheme that replaces existing arrangements in relation to reportable assaults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will provide greater protections for older Australians by taking into account broader instances of abuse and neglect, by introducing more robust requirements for residential aged-care providers to respond and report, and by providing the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission with more functions and powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces legislative requirements that will build provider capacity to identify risk and respond to incidents if and when they occur. By imposing these requirements, the scheme is expected to drive learning and improvements that will reduce the number of preventable serious incidents in future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 April 2021, residential aged-care providers will gain additional responsibilities to identify, record, manage and resolve all incidents that occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus will be on a provider's response to an incident—the supports they put in place for the impacted aged-care consumer or consumers; the actions they take to continuously improve and reduce the likelihood of incidents reoccurring; and the way in which they use information about incidents to inform risk management, feedback and education to staff and to improve the service's capability to prevent, manage and resolve incidents. Through the scheme, providers will also be required to report serious incidents to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill defines reportable incidents to include a number of categories of abuse and neglect. This includes: unreasonable use of force, unlawful sexual contact or inappropriate sexual conduct, psychological or emotional abuse, stealing or financial coercion by a staff member, inappropriate use of physical or chemical restraint, unexplained absences from care, neglect and unexpected death. Importantly, unlike the previous aged-care reporting scheme, there is no exemption on the reporting of resident-on-resident incidents, where the resident has an assessed cognitive impairment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it be alleged, suspected or a known occurrence, residential aged-care providers will be required to report serious incidents to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. Reporting to the commission will be implemented in two phases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From April 2021, a two-stage reporting process will be required for all critical reportable incidents—which are those that result in physical or psychological injury or illness requiring onsite medical or psychological treatment or more significant treatment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within 24 hours of becoming aware of the reportable incident, the residential aged-care provider must notify the commission. If the incident is also criminal in nature, the provider must also make a report to police. Following the initial report, the second stage of the reporting process involves an incident status report that must be provided to the commission within five business days, or by a date specified by the commission. The status report will include any outstanding or relevant information that was not provided in the first notification, for example remedial action taken or supports put in place to minimise harm to the victim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The residential aged-care provider may also be required to submit a final report within two months of the incident. The commission will determine, on a case-by-case basis, if a final report is required and if so, the parameters of the report. It will likely include matters relating to investigation of the incident, and corrective actions being taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From later in 2021 providers will be required to report all other serious incidents within 30 days. Until these reporting requirements commence, providers must still keep records of these incidents. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Existing record-keeping requirements will be expanded to cover the broader incident management obligations. These require records of each incident to be kept by the provider, as well as the need to make records available to the commission. This enables the commission to fulfil its assessment, monitoring, compliance and complaints-handling functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will be responsible for administering the scheme, using its existing monitoring and regulatory powers. Once the commission receives reports about serious incidents, it will apply risk-based monitoring of how aged-care providers investigate and respond to serious incidents. In instances where the responses are inadequate, the commission may require further action, such as an independent investigation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also provide the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner with additional functions and powers dedicated to dealing with the scheme. These are intended to ensure the commission is able to respond proportionately to all levels of risk, to safeguard consumers. This will include powers to respond to serious incidents and provide compliance notices and directions to take action, and will also include imposing civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions to ensure compliance with the new obligations under the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure consistency in regulation, the bill will enable these powers to be used more broadly, to enforce the aged-care responsibilities of approved providers and related offences. These are standard regulatory powers available under the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, to provide the commission with a more graduated suite of powers for responding to and preventing noncompliance. These powers will also enable the commission to take more effective action to protect consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides additional powers to enable the commission to obtain information or documents directly from its source. This will ensure the commission is equipped to obtain the information the commission requires to effectively carry out its reportable incident functions under the scheme, while enhancing the commission's broader regulatory framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also strengthen protections for people who report abuse or neglect in a residential aged-care facility to cover both existing and former staff members as well as current and past residential care recipients, their families and others supporting them. These changes are necessary to ensure those who witness or suspect that a serious incident has occurred do not face repercussions, such as civil or criminal liability, for making such reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following passage of the bill, subordinate legislation will specify additional details, including incident management system requirements and the reporting time frames mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme complements and supports existing regulatory settings including the integrated expectations of the Aged Care Quality Standards, the Charter of Aged Care Rights and open disclosure requirements. Together these will support residential aged-care providers to engage in risk management and continuous improvement to deliver safe and quality care to older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health, safety and wellbeing of older Australians is of utmost importance to the Australian government. Any abuse of a person in residential aged care is unacceptable and it is important that these incidents are reported, managed and prevented from occurring in future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  Litigation funding and class actions provide a vital path to justice for Australians trying to uphold their rights against governments and large companies with vastly greater resources, but on 13 May 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, the Attorney-General of Australia stood up in this place and warned us about the dangers of Australians exercising those legal rights. It was an extraordinary performance. The same Attorney-General who says it is impossible to establish a national integrity commission because the government is focused only on the COVID-19 pandemic still found time to smash the rights of ordinary Australians to have their day in court. The Prime Minister told us that he was 'not going to have one public servant diverted from the task of focusing on our whole-of-government approach to dealing with this pandemic'—not one public servant other than the dozens and dozens of public servants who have been diverted to focus on the Prime Minister's whole-of-government approach to attacking class actions and undermining access to justice! What a joke. The Prime Minister has no time and no resources available to tackle government corruption but he has endless resources at his disposal when it comes to undermining access to justice for ordinary Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such was the government's enthusiasm in attacking class actions that they did not even wait for the committee to hold its first public hearing, let alone finish its inquiry, before taking action. Just one week after the Attorney-General moved the motion to establish the inquiry, which is now being extended again, the Morrison government announced new regulations for litigation funders and class actions. In an extraordinary display of arrogance and incompetence, the Treasurer's announcement of new regulations pre-empted the predetermined outcome of the government's own sham inquiry. So you might well ask, 'Why is the government even bothering to extend the time for this inquiry to report?' This inquiry has been a sham from the outset. The government, I repeat, did not wait for this inquiry to be completed before actually making a whole set of new regulations. They are not, unhappily, fit for purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer's regulations are not fit for purpose unless the purpose is to deny ordinary Australians access to justice. Do not take my word for it. That is the ASIC view of these regulations. It's also the view of the Treasurer's own department. It was also the view of the Australian Law Reform Commission, which completed a comprehensive inquiry into class actions and litigation funding two years ago. The Australian Law Reform Commission's report, a report commissioned by this government, was ignored. It apparently didn't tell the government what it wanted to hear. Instead of responding to the Law Reform Commission, this government set up its own inquiry. That's the inquiry that we're dealing with here; the inquiry that's being extended for another two weeks to report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One can only imagine that perhaps the government is going to respond to this inquiry which it's extending for a couple of weeks. Let's hope that the inquiry proves not to be a sham. Let's hope that the two weeks that we are going to give this committee to continue with its inquiry are going to be used properly to examine the regulations that the Treasurer has made without waiting for this inquiry to report. Let's hope that the inquiry is going to actually report on the disproportionate impact on Australians in the regions—Australians like property owners whose land has been poisoned by toxic PFAS chemicals, the group of Bundaberg growers who are planning a class action against the operator of the Paradise Dam, in relation to the lowering of the wall, or perhaps the households and businesses in North Queensland who are planning a class action against power companies over allegations of price gouging. It's not just those people who are going to be hit by the Treasurer's regulations that this inquiry ought to be looking at and that we hope that it spends the additional two weeks looking at; the regulations that the Treasurer has made will also hit the Australian Farmers Fighting Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Farmers Fighting Fund, for members who might be unaware of it, is a not-for-profit litigation funder that is fighting for Australian farmers and has launched several actions on behalf of groups of farmers. Where is the National Party on this issue? They have been conspicuously silent. Why do they sit there silently while their coalition partner has ridden roughshod over farmers, over property owners, over households and over businesses in rural and regional Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will be moving a motion in the Senate today to disallow the Treasurer's regulations, and the question for the senators of the National Party is this: is playing nice with the Treasurer and a handful of Liberal donors more important to you than standing up for the rights of Australian farmers? And the question for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is this: if you're going to side with the Morrison government on this issue, as you've done on virtually every other issue, what is your point? Stop pretending and just rejoin the Liberal Party.</span>

We are heading towards a cliff—at 200 kilometres an hour—and the government has no plan to stop us going over the edge. When the Australian population is at threat, when there is a threat to the safety and the livelihoods of our people and our country, parliament should drop everything to deal with it. That is why it is so urgent that we deal with this today. </span>

But we are failing to protect the Australian people against the imminent threats of the climate emergency, threats that are costing lives and livelihoods now and will do so much more in the future unless we take action very quickly. To explain why this is so urgent and why what is being done at the moment is not enough, we must understand what Australia has promised to do as part of the Paris Agreement and how that is failing. </span>

The planet's already warmed by over a degree. Why is it important to keep global warming at less than two degrees? It's a bit like the human body. If the human body gets too hot, once it gets over a certain point, past a tipping point, you might not be able to predict exactly which organ is going to shut down, you might not be able to predict exactly how much damage there's going to be to the patient, but you know that after a certain point the effects may become uncontrollable and the patient may die, so you want to keep the human body well below a certain temperature and not let things get too hot. It's the same with the planet. The scientists have told us, 'Don't let the planet get hotter by more than two degrees or we might not be able to stop it and it may become an unstoppable chain reaction.' We are already at one degree. </span>

We are going to miss the edge of the cliff and go over it, and we are going to do that during the lifetime of today's primary school students. Even worse—and this is why it is so urgent—is that the Bureau of Meteorology has told this parliament that the effects will be worse in Australia. They've said to us that we could hit 4.4 degrees of warming in Australia by the end of this century. That is what the government's targets are consistent with. They are consistent with a wipe-out of agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin. They are consistent with a planet where, during the lifetime of today's primary school students in Australia, Australia will only be inhabitable for a couple of million people. That is what we face if we go over the cliff edge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the government has refused to accept the truth. This motion calls on the government to tell the truth, to tell the truth that our current targets and the world's current targets are not enough. We may well meet and beat them but that won't be enough to stop us going over the edge. We must also suspend standing orders, because things are going to happen in the next few days that could help us pull back and not go over the edge of the climate cliff as the government is planning for us to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is going to be a global summit, within the next 10 or so days, put together by countries including the UK, headed by a conservative government but where they understand we are all facing the climate fight of our lives, and we've got to act. At this summit of global climate ambition countries are being asked to come with pledges to do more in the next 10 or so years so that we avoid going over the climate cliff. If Australia declares a climate emergency today and joins the New Zealand parliament, which is also moving to declare a climate emergency today, we may well get a spot at that summit for global climate ambition and serve as a signal to the rest of the world that they need to act as well and that Australia has understood the significance of the fight that we are in. Then, of course, following that will be the summit that the new President of the United States, Joe Biden, is convening, where leaders of the world are being pulled together to say what they're going to do over the next 10 years. And then after that there is the global climate summit in Glasgow. But what we do over the next 10 days could help shape what the world does and whether we stay on this side of the climate cliff or whether we go over it, and that's why standing orders must be suspended and suspended today. Australia should join New Zealand and countries like England, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Canada and Japan in recognising the seriousness of the climate emergency, and that would help shift global momentum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is urgent because we are passing climate tipping points now. As we speak, scientists are extremely worried about a part of Antarctica melting at the rate now that they thought they might see in 20 years time, and, if that part of Antarctica goes, we are locking in multi-metre sea level rises during the lifetime of today's primary school students—just from that one thing alone. We cannot pass that tipping point, because then climate change will become an unstoppable chain reaction. So what happens now, on the watch of this government and this parliament, will determine whether my daughters and the kids of people in this parliament go into every summer holiday worried about how many people are going to die from bushfires and heatwaves and worried about how powerful the next cyclone that hits is going to be or whether they enjoy a safe climate—a safer climate than the one that we're determined give to them at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government may well say, and I expect they will: 'Oh, look, this is just a statement. Why have a declaration of something?' Well, the first step to fixing a problem is admitting that you've got a problem, and at the moment the government doesn't admit we've got a problem. The government says: 'It's okay. We've made our contributions. We're meeting our Kyoto targets. It's all fine.' What they don't tell you when they beat their chests and say, 'We've met our Kyoto 2020 targets,' is that the 2020 targets allowed Australia to increase its pollution, the only country in the world that could increase its pollution. What a way to pat ourselves on the back! We were allowed to increase our pollution. The point is: even if we meet the targets that are set at the moment, that won't be enough to stop us going over the edge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment there seems to be no sense from the government that we are facing an emergency, so the parliament needs to tell the government that it is an emergency. In the past the government have declared a budget emergency; they told us that we had a budget emergency. We even had a strawberry emergency, and this whole parliament had to suspend its operations for a day to deal with that. If we can have a budget emergency and a strawberry emergency, we should be able to declare a climate emergency and declare it today. There's a simple statement of fact in this motion: it doesn't condemn the government; it just declares that we are in a climate emergency. You either accept that we are in a climate emergency and you accept the science or you don't. I urge the government to follow the lead, if they don't want to follow us, of Boris Johnson. Follow the conservatives in the United Kingdom, who declared a climate emergency in their parliament. Follow the rest of the world. Tell the truth so that we can then start to act on this crisis that we are facing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I second the motion. We must as a matter of utmost emergency suspend standing orders and deal with this motion because the earth and this country are indeed in the middle of a climate emergency, and the sooner we understand and acknowledge that and declare a climate emergency, the sooner we can all get off our collective backsides and do something about it. It's not that hard to declare a climate emergency. The New Zealand parliament is expected to today declare a climate emergency. Already England, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Canada, Japan and countless other jurisdictions around the world have declared a climate emergency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How much more evidence do we need that we have a climate emergency? How can we so quickly forget the shocking bushfires of last summer? How can we ignore the fact that the Bureau of Meteorology has declared the November just finished to be the hottest November on record? How can we ignore what might be ahead of us in this summer—whether it be more bushfires or shocking storms or hurricanes or who knows what else? It is undeniable that we have a climate emergency. We have to listen to the experts. For example, the Australian Medical Association has warned that at 3.4 to 4.4 degrees of warming the consequences of climate change will be serious and both direct and indirect. Observe the projected health impacts, globally and in Australia. The Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements warned that 'climate driven natural hazards are expected to become more frequent and intense'. Ninety atmospheric physicists, meteorologists and climate scientists from 40 countries have advised the world that this is the critical decade and that global emissions must be halved by 2030, or we risk spiralling into a chain reaction of natural disasters and feedback loops that will be beyond humanity's ability to control. We have to listen to the Bureau of Meteorology when they say 3.4 to 4.4 degrees of warming by the year 2100. That's only 80 years away. That will be in the lifetime of the children of members of this parliament and within the lifetime of people in primary school today. This is a real emergency. It's not something in the distant past; it's real and it's imminent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After we've declared the climate emergency, we then need to get serious about dealing with it. This country has the know-how and resources to deal with it. We have an abundance of renewable energy resources. We have to use them. We have to put this country on a credible pathway to zero net carbon emissions and 100 per cent reliance on renewable energy—not by 2050, but by 2030. Yes, that's bold and ambitious. Some people would say it's impossible. But let's go for it. Let's set an example for the rest of the world. Let's show what one of the richest, brightest and most fortunate countries in the world can achieve when we put our minds to it and our shoulders to the wheel. We've got an abundance of energy: solar, wind, geothermal, wave, clean hydrogen, hydro, pumped hydro, emerging technologies and things we haven't even discovered yet because we haven't tried to discover them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an urgent need to suspend standing orders to deal with this motion and for this parliament to debate and then declare a climate emergency. As I said in my opening remarks, we can then get off our collective backsides and do something about it. We can help to clean up this environment and we can help to address climate change, and we can be a global leader in this space. While we're at it, we can also be a leader in our region and help the countries in our region with increased foreign aid for them to deal with climate change and to prepare for the consequences of  climate change. We've got to think about them as well, the people who live in the lowlands of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Pacific island microstates. They are all going to have a terrible time, within their lifetimes, because of the consequences of climate change. We have to be honest about climate change and stop kidding ourselves that, just because we think we only contribute 1.5 per cent of global emissions, it's not that big a deal for us. What about all our exported emissions—the captive emissions in our coal and our gas that we send to other countries—which, when they're all added up show that we're actually contributing some five per cent to global emissions? We are a major polluter. We have a moral obligation and an economic obligation to do something about it</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm honoured to second the motion moved by the member for Melbourne. The government didn't give leave for this to be debated, but I urge them to get behind it now. Why not vote in support of this motion? Why not, today, declare a climate emergency? That's what a responsible government would do. That's what a government that is in tune with the will of the community would do. That's what we need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have strong targets, we have a clear plan and we have an exemplary track record, one that members in this place and, indeed, all Australians can be proud of. The truth is that those opposite and the Greens, who proposed this motion, would rather cover their ears than hear the facts. That's why I welcome the opportunity to talk to this motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say at the outset that Australia is 100 per cent committed to the Paris Agreement and to strong and practical global action as a response to climate change. We are the government that signed up to the Paris Agreement. We welcome the United States to the Paris Agreement. We've adopted a 2030 target as our nationally determined contribution, which those opposite have walked away from. We are the government that have set out a clear plan to meet and beat that target, that are making investments that will enable us to meet and beat that target—and beyond. We are the government that remained committed throughout to the Kyoto protocol when others waivered. Canada quit, and their emissions are virtually unchanged since 2005 while we have reduced our emissions by 16.6 per cent. New Zealand refused to commit to a second Kyoto target, and their emissions have barely budged since 2005 as ours have come down by 16.6 per cent.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TAYLOR:</span>
                  </a>  These are the facts. They don't like them, but these are the facts. When we came to government in 2013 we faced a deficit. We had to get another reduction of 755 million tonnes to reach our 2020 target, which finished on 30 June. We have beaten that target by 459 million tonnes. That's almost a year's worth of emissions. A turnaround of over 1.2 billion tonnes—that's almost two years turnaround in terms of emissions over an eight-year period. That is an extraordinary outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite won't tell the truth, that our emissions are coming down. They have come down. We have met and beaten our target. The member for Melbourne and those opposite have always said in the past that we can't do it without a carbon tax. When those opposite left government in 2013 they forecast that emissions this year would be 637 million tonnes. That was their forecast, with a carbon tax. We have just learnt that our emissions are 513 million tonnes—20 per cent lower. And we got rid of the carbon tax!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Outcomes matter. It's actions and outcomes that matter. That's what matters for atmospheric concentration, not motions to suspend standing orders—that's not what matters; it's not about tokenism. Between 2005 and 2018 we halved the emissions intensity in the economy. Australia's emissions fell faster than the OECD average, faster than Canada's, faster than New Zealand's, faster than Japan's and faster than the United States's. These are the facts. By 2018 emissions were 13 per cent lower than 2005 levels, and, as I said a moment ago, the latest data has us 16.6 per cent below that baseline. That's in line with Germany, who are at 15 per cent. They are doing pretty well but about the same—level pegging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why has Australia done so well? Well, it's partly about significant reductions in electricity and also about agriculture and land management. They've all played a role. In fact, emissions in the National Electricity Market came down 5.3 per cent in the last year. We as a country have invested $30 billion in renewable energy since 2017. We invested $9 billion last year; the Clean Energy Regulator tells us it will be about the same this year. We continue to deploy solar and wind 10 times faster than the global average. One in four Australian houses have solar on their roofs—the highest number in the world. We're a world-beater. We are faster than Europe, the United States, China or Japan. We are world-beaters. We on this side of the House understand that, and we know that that trend will continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We celebrate Australian achievement. We believe in this country. We believe in enterprise and, most of all, we believe in technology, not taxation. That's central to our comeback from COVID-19. That's central to bringing down emissions while maintaining a strong economy, while continuing to invest in the industries and jobs that support people in the suburbs and regional Australia and continuing to invest in the crucial manufacturing sector for this country—which those opposite and the member for Melbourne couldn't care less about. He couldn't care less about it because he doesn't have it in his electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's experience has shown that, when new technologies become commercially attractive versus their higher emitting alternatives, they will be adopted by small businesses, households and industry. That's what happens and that is our policy. That is our policy. Our Technology Investment Roadmap embodies that, with a focus on five priority technologies: hydrogen; soil carbon; carbon capture and storage, which, I might remind those opposite, Joe Biden has said they will double down on; low-carbon materials like steel and aluminium; and long duration energy storage. All of those technologies have clear targets which bring them to parity, which means they will be adopted by small businesses and industries alike. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're putting serious funding behind that, with our Climate Solutions Package at $3½ billion, including our investment in Snowy 2.0 in the Climate Solutions Fund; $1.9 billion in the budget just past in new energy technologies; and $72 million in the Future Fuels Fund, focused on enabling Australians to make the choice to buy an electric vehicle when they want to buy an electric vehicle. It's their choice, not the government's, but we'll support them in making those choices. There is hydrogen hub funding of $70 million. What an extraordinary opportunity for Australia in hydrogen. We're backing it, just as we've backed Australia building industries throughout our time in government. For microgrids, there is an extra $53.6 million in the budget, on top of the $50 million we've already committed; this is about getting new technologies at the edge of the grid and the fringe of the grid. There is $50 million for carbon capture and storage because it is working: 58 projects around the world, almost half in the United States—the biggest one? It's here in Australia. There is $1.4 billion of baseline funding for ARENA. In total, we have $18 billion supporting investments in technologies, to get those technologies to parity and to deploy those technologies in a way which is going to strengthen the economy, not hurt it, as the member for Melbourne and those opposite would have it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important in understanding why we oppose this motion what the alternative is—because, if it isn't technology, it has to be taxes. There are only two choices here. It's technology versus taxes. And we know how much the member for Melbourne loves a good tax. We know how much those opposite love a good tax. But we have laid out our plans clearly, and there are no taxes in that. There are no taxes in that. </span>
              </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020. It is a very lengthy name for a bill that does some pretty simple things, one of which, regrettably, is to send JobSeeker back to the old Newstart rate, a rate of payment which nearly everybody in the country, apart from, perhaps, the Prime Minister, agrees is unlivable for Australians. That is a very regrettable thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This nation is in the midst of a pandemic. We're still recovering from it. We're not out of the woods yet, and yet in the middle of this pandemic the government is seeing fit to send Australians back to a level of income that nearly everybody, apart from the Prime Minister, regards as unlivable. We note that this bill effectively continues, until 31 March next year, other beneficial social security changes that are due to sunset on 31 December this year by giving the minister relevant regulation-making powers, which include concessions to the JobSeeker income test and partner income test. Currently the minister has the power under the Social Security Act 1991 to continue paying the coronavirus supplement, except for recipients of youth allowance student, in three-month intervals, subject to being satisfied it is necessary to ameliorate the social and economic impacts of the coronavirus. Under this power, the minister has been able to set the rate of the coronavirus supplement. This bill repeals that ongoing power and will prevent the minister from extending the coronavirus supplement beyond 31 March 2021. No doubt, as we move into a post-COVID world—in the year to come, hopefully, with a vaccine on its way—we've still got to deal with the effects of the Morrison recession. This type of support is absolutely needed more than ever. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have mentioned in this House some of these alarming figures previously, but let's reflect again on the numbers. With another 160,000 Australians expected to lose their jobs and 1.6 million Australians on JobSeeker, the government has missed a huge opportunity to deliver certainty for Australians who are doing it very tough, by delivering a permanent increase to JobSeeker in the budget. Over the past week, the Treasurer has come into this place and jumped around like a jack-in-a-box, talking about how there's an economic recovery underway—'economic recovery, economic recovery'. An economic recovery doesn't help people who are still on JobSeeker; it doesn't help people who are still unemployed. They have a finite level of income with which to pay all their bills. All the talk about an economic recovery doesn't help people on JobSeeker, so the last thing you should be doing is cutting their rate of payment in the midst of a pandemic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many more jobseekers than there are job vacancies. There are simply not enough jobs for everyone who needs one. It's all very well for the Prime Minister to say, 'If you have a go, you get a go,' and, 'The best form of welfare is a job.' If every single job vacancy were filled, there would still be many more Australians unemployed. There are simply not enough jobs to go around. This is a fact of mathematics. There are not enough jobs to go around. And when there aren't enough jobs to go around, you have a moral obligation to look after those who are unable to get a job. You don't cut their level of income to less than what it costs to actually exist and live decently in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's even worse in the regions—some of which I represent—and that's a result of this government's failure to deliver a jobs program for our regions. It has no plan for jobs. It has a plan to cut JobSeeker payments, but it has no plan for jobs. In Tasmania, there are 21 jobseekers for every available job. Think about that. For every single job that's available, you've got 21 people lining up and 20 of them are going home disappointed. ABS figures released last week show that more than 50,000 Tasmanians are either looking for a job or can't get the hours they need to make ends meet. This has to be front and centre. Many Australians are in jobs—they're off the books as far as the government is concerned in terms of official unemployment figures—but they are underemployed, some drastically. They're not getting enough hours they need at work, which means they're not getting enough hours they need to pay the bills. That's why the neighbourhood food banks, community houses and donation boxes are absolutely flat out. They are feeding people now who they've never had to feed before: people with jobs. People who have employment are going to food banks to get their groceries, because the income they get is not enough. And yet we have this government seeking to take people back to the old rate of what was Newstart. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of jobs in Tasmania has fallen by 2,200 since August, and our unemployment rate is well above the national average. We're all hopeful in Tasmania that the reopening of borders that's underway this week will improve the desperate job situation that we have. But hope doesn't pay the bills. Hope doesn't pay the rent. Hope doesn't put food on the table. Hope doesn't put clothes on the kids. We need a jobs plan, not a wing and a prayer. In Tasmania, our jobs crisis is also a wages crisis. Tasmanians have experienced a fall in wages of 4.9 per cent, when the average fall has been 3.3 per cent. We're doing worse than the national average. And that drop-off comes off an already lower average wage in Tasmania. Tasmanian average weekly wages have fallen by $71, from $1,448 to $1,377, while national wages have fallen by $56 a week. We're doing much worse in Tasmania than the national average when it comes to affordability, and that's why the coronavirus supplement has been so important for people doing it tough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That supplement is paid to recipients of JobSeeker payment, youth allowance, parenting payment, Austudy, Abstudy, partner allowance, widow allowance, farm household allowance and special benefit. Between 27 April and 24 September this year, the coronavirus supplement was paid at a flat rate of $550 per fortnight. We've heard lots of anecdotal evidence about the difference that the supplement made to people's lives. For the first time in a long time they were able to pay their bills, and buy clothes and new school shoes for their kids, things that most of us would consider as by the by. People on low incomes could finally afford those essentials. Between 25 September and 31 December, the government decided that the recovery was apparently on the way, 'So we'll reduce the supplement to a rate of $250 per fortnight.' Now they've announced that, between 1 January 2021—four weeks away—and 31 March 2021, the coronavirus supplement will be paid at a flat rate of $150 per fortnight. In a matter of eight months, they've stripped $400 a fortnight away from people who don't have the money to spare. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month Labor moved amendments to the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020, calling for the government to deliver a permanent increase to the rate of JobSeeker. This is critical. As I said, everybody in this country, apart from the Prime Minister, understands that the old rate of Newstart was too low to survive on. We all know it was too low to survive on. We've had members opposite acknowledge that it's too low to survive on. We've got the Liberal member for Bass in my state acknowledging it's too low. But those opposite are nowhere to be seen when it comes to actually legislating a permanent increase to JobSeeker, and that's what is needed. People cannot afford to go back to the old rate. The government need to legislate a permanent increase to JobSeeker. This bill is a missed opportunity for the government to deliver a permanent increase to this base rate of unemployment support, and that's why Labor is moving an amendment calling on the government to permanently increase the base rate of JobSeeker payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, there are beneficial elements to this bill. It continues the coronavirus supplement for youth allowance for students and apprentices after December. There are increased income-free areas, taper rates and partner income tests that have been introduced as part of the pandemic. But this bill also puts in black and white the government's cruel plan to revert to pre-pandemic levels on unemployment support from 31 March 2021. Is that when they think it's all going to be over? Do they think the world is going to be back to normal as of March 2021? Taking those payments back to pre-pandemic levels will hurt, and hurt in the most essential way, around two million Australians. Two million Australians who are already doing it tough will be hurt even further by this cruel and heartless government. These cuts will affect people who have lost their jobs, single parents and students. On 31 March, rent will not go down, food prices will not go down, the price of putting petrol in the car will not go down, school costs will not go down, but this government is expecting people on low incomes to take a massive hit to their income. They're saying, 'Find a job'—that doesn't exist—'and be happy with the way life is treating you,' because, apparently, there's an economic recovery underway. Where is the empathy? Where is the understanding? Where is the support? Where is the arm around the shoulder, the Australian way of looking after your mate when they're doing it tough; where is it? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Minister for Social Services just recently saying an increase to what was then Newstart would result in more money for drug dealers and pubs. That's what she thinks. That's where she thinks this money is going—to drug dealers and pubs. I'll tell you where it is going, Deputy Speaker Mitchell. It's going to rent. It's going to food. It's going to school costs. It's going to petrol in the car. It's going to clean clothes so that you can present yourself decently at a job interview. On the old rate of Newstart, which they're now returning to, people can't afford to go look for a job. They can't afford to get clothes in order to present themselves to a job interview. They can't afford the bus fare to the job interview.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about $40 a day, we're not talking about $40 in your pocket for your incidentals in life. We're not talking about $40 a day for breakfast, a bit of afternoon tea, lunch and a bus fare. We're talking about $40 a day that has to cover rent, food, petrol and health costs. No-one here in this place, I included, would be able to do it. It is scandalously cruel to expect people to be able to do it—and all because of some ideological view in the guts of those opposite. In their guts those opposite believe that people who are unemployed are unemployed because it's their own fault.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They really, truly believe that people just aren't trying hard enough to get a job, and maybe if they turn the screws on hard enough it will force people to go and get a job that doesn't exist. In Tasmania there are 21 jobseekers for every available job. Mathematics don't lie. For every job that's available, 20 people are leaving a job interview disappointed. What are they meant to do to pay the bills? Those over there should be ashamed about the situation they are putting already vulnerable Australians into. They're not satisfied with literally stealing the money of hundreds of thousands of Australians under robodebt. They're not satisfied with that; now they're returning Australians to a level of payment that they literally cannot live on. Those opposite should be ashamed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The more generous partner income test for JobSeeker payment, which Labor negotiated, is tapering at 27c in the dollar and cutting out at a partner income of $80,000 per year. A hundred thousand people would be impacted if the more generous partner income test were not continued, including 40,000 people who would lose access to payments entirely. It's been announced that the government intends to continue to use this power. But why would it continue those and not retain the coronavirus supplement? Why would it do that? I don't understand. I don't understand how this government thinks when it comes to poor people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just some stats: in 2019, 58 people took their lives due to being unemployed, 32 people took their lives due to work related mental strain, 37 people took their lives due to the absence of a family member, 19 people took their lives due to the threat of losing their job and 214 people took their lives due to housing and economic circumstances. Being poor can be a death sentence, and those opposite are making that much more likely. They should be ashamed of themselves. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

People in this place, at least on this side, are going to be very, very emotional and passionate in their contributions on this bill and the amendment that Labor has moved, because it is an emotional topic. We're talking about people. We're talking about Australians who are struggling and who have been struggling. We're talking about the lack of empathy, the lack of care, the lack of regard, frankly, from the government benches to that struggle. So people will be emotive and emotional. They will be passionate in their contributions, and I think it's because there is a degree of care for Australians who are suffering and for the constituents in our electorates we speak to who have been struggling and who will struggle on JobSeeker on $40 a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 160,000 people who are expected to lose their jobs, and there are 1.4 million Australians on JobSeeker currently. The previous speakers have talked about the missed opportunity to deliver certainty for these Australians with respect to delivering a permanent increase to JobSeeker and extending JobSeeker, and on both fronts the government has failed. We have consistently called for this increase for a number of years now, even before the pandemic struck, because we understood, and continue to understand, the need. But, of course, it fell on deaf ears on the government benches. And, if they have their way, the rate will return to $40 a day—$40 a day puts people into poverty; $40 a day forces people to skip meals; and $40 a day will take our economic recovery backwards, put a brake on it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said this before: the people in my community who are on JobSeeker or Newstart are not saving that money in a sock under their bed. They're not buying shares with it. They're not going out on the piss. They're not going out gambling.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KHALIL:</span>
                    </a>  But the government benches would like us to believe that people on JobSeeker are spending this money frivolously. That's just not the case. There are families who are struggling day by day to put food on the table and buy clothes for their children so they can go to school. I don't think it's an understatement to say that there are many Australians in this situation who struggled even before the pandemic. And they're not saving this money, as I said, under their beds. They're going to be spending it. They're going to be spending it in the economy. Even the economic argument that this government puts about the economic recovery, the economics of recovery, the reduction in unemployment and so on is short-sighted because that JobSeeker money is going to be spent in the economy. The single mum is now not going to buy that extra coffee. She's not going to be able to spend that extra bit of money in retail because it goes back to those basic needs when you're on $40 a day. And that can only be bad for the economy and our economic recovery in the long run. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, for all of these reasons, Labor is moving this amendment today, calling for the government to permanently increase the base rate of JobSeeker, and we've said it time and time again. These amendments are about calling the government to reverse their plan to cut the coronavirus supplement around Christmas time and to deliver that permanent increase for JobSeeker. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speakers have also spoken about the benefits in this bill. But, like everything this government does, they just short-change you, don't they? There's a lot of shallowness: it all looks good on the surface but, when you scratch it and go a bit deeper, you start to see the big gaps, the chasms, that emerge that a whole lot of Australians fall into. I can't understand why, but maybe it's people they don't like. There are demographics that have been left out of their support packages that have fallen through the cracks. It can only be because they don't regard these people, they don't care about them. I can't find any other explanation for it. Whether it's the unemployed, whether it's carers, whether it's people who are temporary migrants or whether it's asylum seekers and refugees, they're all falling through the cracks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes continuing the coronavirus supplement for youth allowance—students and apprentices—after December; that's a good thing. But it also puts in black and white the government's plan to revert to the pre-pandemic level of unemployment support from 31 March 2021. As previous speakers have said, that is unnecessary; it's cruel. Two million Australians will be hurt by these cuts and Australians are already feeling anxious about Christmas, knowing that in just a few months these payments will be cut. Unlike the government, we on this side, Labor, know that the impacts of the pandemic will actually continue. They'll last for years. The pandemic isn't going to come to an end at the end of December or even on 31 March. We hope the vaccine is distributed and starts to work, but there will be ongoing economic and social impacts of what we have experienced this year. The Department of Social Services is expecting the number of people relying on unemployment support still to be elevated in four years time. So not only is a permanent increase in the base rate needed for the basic dignity of these people, so they can get by on a basic living wage with basic living costs covered, but it's also needed for the economic recovery. As I said, this money isn't going to be hidden under a bed; it's going to be spent in the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have argued that the minister should also have the flexibility to continue extending the coronavirus supplement for as long as the impact of the pandemic persists, not just until 31 March. And it's actually this power, which Labor insisted upon way back in, I think, March this year, that has enabled the government to introduce more generous partner income tests for the JobSeeker payment, make changes to the JobSeeker and youth allowance personal income tests which provide an income-free area of about $300 per fortnight compared with the prepandemic income-free area of $106 a fortnight—something, we are advised, around 15,000 people are benefiting from. We insisted on those changes. It also allowed the government to make changes to the JobSeeker and youth allowance eligibility criteria, so that sole traders, the self-employed, permanent employees who have been stood down or people self-isolating because they, or someone they are caring for, have been affected by the pandemic can continue to be eligible for payment. It has allowed them to waive the ordinary waiting period of one week for the seasonal work preclusion period and the newly arrived residents waiting period, and it has allowed them to extend the time people can maintain eligibility for payment and keep concession cards. We insisted on all of that. We pushed all of this because we understood the impacts and the follow-through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill, the government is forcing people to rely, effectively, on food bank services and emergency relief. When those payments are cut, where are they going to go? They're passing the buck to NGOs already at full capacity. They're passing the buck to charities that are already overwhelmed. They're passing the buck to volunteers and neighbours. Australians have made a tremendous effort during this pandemic. I know my colleagues here know how much work is being done in their local electorates by NGOs, charities and volunteers to help people in need and to support them. That doesn't mean the government should renege on its responsibility, but it has passed the buck again. Where they have allowed people to fall between those cracks that have become chasms, the pieces are being picked up by ordinary Australians who are doing good, who are caring for each other and who are doing the best in what are the most difficult circumstances. So I don't think it's fair to say that the government has just missed an opportunity. It's way more than that. Yes, they've missed an opportunity to deliver certainty for Australians doing it tough by delivering a permanent increase to JobSeeker in this bill. They've missed that opportunity, but they've also failed to fulfil their responsibility and their obligation as the government of Australia to support people in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are simply not enough jobs for everyone who needs one. There are about seven jobseekers for each job vacancy in a capital city. If you're in the regions, forget about it; it's even more difficult to find a job. That is the result of the government's failure to deliver a jobs program for our regions. I'm not suggesting that it's all the government's responsibility. There are a lot of things that are out of the government's control; they can't control everything. But one thing they do have control over and one thing they can make an impact on is ensuring that each of those Australians who are doing it tough has at least the ability to cover the basics of living through this JobSeeker payment. I've heard from my own constituents how some have been forced to skip meals and to struggle throughout. Across Australia, there are one million jobseekers left out of work, including older workers. The budget left almost one million Australians on JobSeeker aged over 35 out of the budget and ineligible for its wage subsidy. Older Australians represent the largest cohort on JobSeeker, and they also have the most difficulty finding work because of structural barriers and age discrimination. And the government just left them out of the budget. They actively made it harder for them to find work, with the new JobMaker hiring credit skewed towards younger jobseekers under 35. In the last 18 years, the proportion of people on unemployment payments who are over 55 has gone from 8.8 to 26.6 per cent. It has more than trebled. It's also true that many women over the ages of 45 and 50 have struggled, and those numbers have shot up, including the percentages of homeless single women in that age group. There are currently over 300,000 people over 55 on unemployment support, and they are having the most trouble getting off the payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said earlier that the impacts of the virus are far from over and that Australians this year have done a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous job looking out for one another, working with each other and for each other. And they now need this government to look out for them and their interests. The people that are looking for work don't need more cuts. The people struggling to support their families to put food on the table, to buy clothes for their kids and to live in dignity like every other Australian don't need more cuts to JobSeeker in this particular period, at Christmas and in March. Australians, including all those on JobSeeker, expect and deserve a government that will actually support them during the tough times, not make a show of it and splash around the money and then keep entire groups without support or remove that support from them. Australians deserve a rate that sees them living in dignity, not in poverty; that sees people able to look for work; and that gives them that opportunity to go out and look for work, not just to worry about how they would feed or clothe their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're moving this amendment: because it is about empathy. It is about care. In this period during the pandemic, one of the probably less tangible things has been the manner in which Australians have cared for each other, looked out for each other, gone out of their way as neighbours or volunteers or by working in a charity to help those who need it most. To me, one of the wonderful things that have come out of this terrible year has been the efforts that have been made by ordinary Australians to look after people around them in their community—and not just their local family and friends but their larger community. I think that's been reflected in electorates around the country. People have done this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time now for the government to step up and also understand that empathy and care can be translated into better policy. That's why we're moving this amendment and ask those here to support it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  First of all, I congratulate the member for Wills on a really terrific speech that outlines the issues that I very much want to emphasise in my speech today. I would also like to thank the member for Barton for her fantastic advocacy in this area. Having recently visited my electorate with the member for Barton, I can say how much she is loved throughout the country for her care, her empathy and, hence, her wish to amend the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's abundantly clear to me that one of the truisms in health is that, whenever there is a global health issue, the people who suffer the most are the poor. That is certainly the case in the COVID-19 pandemic. Both around the world and also in Australia, the people who suffer the most in this pandemic are those who have the least to lose. I remind those opposite that people in our communities are doing it really tough. For all of their rhetoric and self-congratulations, I do not think that those opposite have a true grasp of the state of things, particularly in some of the more disadvantaged electorates around the country. Outside the affluent suburbs of our major cities, outside the streets of our gated communities and outside the offices of our CEOs, Australians are doing it especially tough.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm honoured to represent the people of Macarthur in this place, and I truly mean that. My community has really been fantastic in how it's dealt with the pandemic. My community's greatest asset is its people, and at the present time their spirit of generosity and camaraderie is really apparent. The people of Macarthur are resilient and they band together to support one another in times of need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time every year I normally run a toy drive, and we give the toys to families in our community who are struggling. This year we have been overwhelmed, more than at any time previously, with the number of toys, the number of gifts and the number of offers of services and things that have been presented to my office to give to those who are really struggling in the community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately these times of need occur too often in my community, and often it's because of the ignorance and the lack of action by government. Our schools have a relatively high percentage of at-risk children, and unemployment and underemployment are historically much higher in my electorate than national averages. The point that I want to make is that my electorate is consistently neglected by the coalition government, both at a state and federal level, and people's standard of living and quality of life ultimately bear the burden of this neglect. </span>

The government needs to understand that its ignorance towards the needs of my electorate is affecting the prospects of local businesses, limiting job availability and forcing people into unemployment queues. The government's consistently championed its new JobMaker scheme, yet it's deliberately starving my community of the very infrastructure and investment that would actually deliver jobs in time of need.</span>

The lack of infrastructure spending, the neglect in our schools, the lack of health services and the lack of transport options are really putting people in my community at risk, and people in my community understand the need for investment in our growing regions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've cared for generations of residents in my electorate of Macarthur, and I understand the challenges of local families and the challenges local businesses face. Many of the young people on the JobSeeker program have been patients of mine. They're decent people. They want to work. They want to do the right thing. But they are starved of resources by this government. The cutbacks in the JobSeeker arrangement, and in particular the cutback to JobSeeker to $40 a day, will bear tragic consequences and increase the stigma of being unemployed on young people in particular. My constituents want their kids to be given support and help to get into the jobs market, to get decent jobs and to support themselves. They want the peace of mind of knowing that their local schools are good schools, that their local hospitals are good hospitals, that there are local jobs and their local transport system works the same as it does on the North Shore and eastern suburbs. It is absolutely disgraceful that this government has allowed this two-tiered sociological system to develop, and they should be ashamed of themselves.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My residents want to have the ability to own a home in a great community and they don't want to be forced into a life of couch surfing, or paying most of their income on rent or crippling mortgage payments. They want to be able to get to the city and to other places for jobs et cetera without having to pay extortionate tolls. People want the assurance that our social security system is a safety net for all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been saying for some time that the rate of—previously the dole, then it became Newstart and now it's another euphemism—JobSeeker is far too low. I've advocated for increases, yet this government ignored those pleas. I hate to see people in my community being stigmatised and traumatised by being made to eke out an existence—and it is only an existence—on a rate that doesn't allow them to dress properly, to eat properly or even to pay for transport costs to go and look for a job. I really am sick of seeing young people in my community not being offered the prospect of a decent education to help them get into the jobs market. I've seen how the other half lives. I understand that many people are able to access all the services that people in my community want, but they can't. We need to see a permanent increase in the rate of JobSeeker, and that is abundantly obvious to anyone who looks at it—every support organisation in my electorate, every doctor who works in my community and every high school principal who struggles to get his kids jobs once they leave school. We're a rich country. We have people doing very well. We can afford to allow people looking for work to have a decent support system to look after them, yet we're not doing it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can subsidise the jet planes of billionaires and we can allow our CEOs to earn salaries in the multiple millions of dollars, yet we can't allow young people looking for work to have enough money to live on decently and to be able to actually look for a decent job. As previously mentioned by the member for Wills, this whole system is a missed opportunity for reform. It's a missed opportunity from a government that really doesn't have a plan for those who are struggling the most in this pandemic. And this pandemic is not over. We know that it will be some time before our community gets back to growth and gets back to the type of community we lived in less than 12 months ago. The government needs to be committed to reform, particularly to support those who are struggling more than most. We've fared relatively well as a country in the COVID-19 pandemic, but it still has had a devastating impact around the world and on our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister ought to have the ability to extend the coronavirus supplement for as long as this pandemic continues and for as long as our economy needs it. Having short-term increases over short periods of time is not good enough. The system needs to be reformed to care for those most at risk. There's a consensus belief that an increase to the rate of JobSeeker would be good for the economy. It seems utterly bewildering that the government would seek to have the economy operating in idle mode and removing desperately needed support for so many Australians at a time when our economy is crying out for more cash flow. Returning JobSeeker to the old Newstart rate isn't good for individuals, it isn't good for communities, it isn't good for jobs, and it isn't good for the economy. Even I understand that, if an individual has less money in their wallet, they have less money to spend on local businesses. The last thing we need in my community is to have our local businesses struggling even more. The government is already starving my community of desperately needed investment, and now they're seeking to turn off the tap for so many young people, in particular, in my community. There are those who say, 'We can't keep spending money,' but we are spending money on supporting other people. We need to be spending money on supporting the most disadvantaged. There simply aren't enough jobs to go around at the present time because the government has no job-creation program. We presently have seven jobseekers for every job vacancy. Matters are even grimmer in the outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas—a fact which the junior coalition partner should readily understand. Many of them, I think, even support a permanent increase in the JobSeeker rate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community and all over the continent people are facing an anxious and uncertain Christmas. It's okay for us; we know that we'll be able to support our families this Christmas. For many people in my community they're not sure about that; they will have to rely on support from non-government agencies to get through Christmas. Christmas is actually a very stressful time for the most disadvantaged in our communities, and we need to be aware of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed cut to the JobSeeker rate, and the threat to the futures of many people because of it, is even more worrying. The least the government can do for the thousands of jobseekers in each of our respective communities is to come to the table to provide some certainty and some concept that it wants to support them with a permanent increase in the rate of JobSeeker. If we want our economy to recover, people need to have money in their pockets to spend on our local businesses and money to support local jobs. It's a vicious cycle: if people have less to spend on local and small businesses, these very businesses have less to spend on wages and jobs. It's a very real risk that the move to reduce the rate of JobSeeker will result in more business closures and job losses, and that's the last thing we need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I echo the sentiments of my friend and colleague the member for Barton and call upon the government to abandon their Christmas cuts to unemployment payments. This is just not the right thing to do. I also speak in favour of the amendment moved by the member for Barton, which is designed to get the government to not cut the coronavirus supplement at Christmas, permanently increase the rate of JobSeeker and enable the minister to keep paying the coronavirus supplement after March.</span>

It wouldn't support the most disadvantaged, and that is to its unending shame. The government has left Australians on JobSeeker aged over 35—almost one million people—out of the budget and ineligible for its wage support structure. The government has unfortunately not seen the need to act to support all Australians. I often hear from constituents who, through no fault of their own, find themselves out of work yet are too young to retire. They are also unsupported. These people face structural barriers in gaining employment as well as age discrimination. These are people with families and mortgages. It's a terrible shame. The government must do better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  First of all, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the government for the financial assistance they have provided to the over three million people who are Centrelink recipients through the provision of the coronavirus supplement since the original outbreak of the virus back in March.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd just like to make it clear: we actually don't need this legislation, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020. The minister already has the power through regulation to extend the supplement. The only exception is if you're a student or apprentice on youth allowance—and they could deal with that separately. This legislation before the House today technically is not needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation does two things, though. It does reduce the coronavirus supplement from $250 a fortnight to $150 a fortnight from 1 January 2021 but I think the underlying purpose of this legislation by the government is to draw a very hard line on the supplement from 31 March 2021, which sounds like a long time away but really isn't. The purpose, then, of this legislation is that there can no longer be any extensions to the coronavirus supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That will take us back to the old Newstart rate, which I know would take many, many people—particularly older people who are having difficulty finding employment but are not yet at the age of retirement, many of whom have worked for decades but can no longer find employment—down to, for a single person, $282 a week. That's actually what every person in this House receives for one night for accommodation. It's pretty outrageous that we would do that to our fellow Australians. In my electorate you cannot rent a single property—not even a one-bedroom bedsit—for $280 a week. So to know that we are going to be taking people back to that rate from 31 March, as winter's coming, is outrageous, and I think we need to do better as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is going to affect people on partner allowance, widow allowance or youth allowance, people who are on the JobSeeker payment and people who are receiving Abstudy living allowance, Austudy, parenting payment, farm household allowance—we're going to do this to our farmers as well—or special benefit. While this is going to affect the individual, in my community it's also going to affect my small businesses, because money circulates in the economy. So people won't be going to the butchers or to my fruit and veg stores. Do you know what that's going to mean? It's going to mean a constriction. That's going to mean that people who are currently working are potentially going to be under the threat of losing their jobs, and then we increase this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are going to be some big winners out of this, though: payday lenders, the pawn shops and the buy-now pay-later schemes. It's going to entrench debt. It's going to entrench hardship. It's unnecessary and it's really bad for the economy to do this. It's going to increase the demand on homelessness services, critical emergency assistance and food relief. It's going to increase the demand on mental health services. They're all services that government pays for, so we're actually not saving any money by doing this. It's a furphy to think that this is helping the budget's bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday I received an email from a woman in her 50s who's currently homeless. She's worked for a long time in her life, but she doesn't have a job at the moment. She's trying to secure private rental in my electorate. Particularly on the south coast, there are up to a hundred people attending open inspections for one home, because we just don't have enough rental properties. She's worried about how she's going to live post the coronavirus supplement ending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we need to do? This is an opportunity for the government to create a permanent increase to the JobSeeker rate. For a very long time the sector was calling for $95 a week. I think that that would be a very reasonable amount that would still provide a huge incentive for people to try and get off JobSeeker while also ensuring that the absolute basics of life can be met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another thing we need to do, and we never really talk about it in this place: we need to lift the age criterion for moving from the single parenting payment to JobSeeker. Right now, when your youngest child is eight years of age, you are moved from that to JobSeeker. I don't know a single member in this place who would leave their eight-year-old child at home alone during working hours. If they managed to get a job, they would be there until at least five o'clock at night and then do the drive home. People say, 'But there's after-school care.' Well, not in the regions. It's very, very difficult to get a place at after-school care in the regions. So, for some parents who have been able to find employment, their children are home alone at night. I really don't think that's the Australia we want to see. We should be lifting that to at least age 10 or 12. I would say 12. That's the age a child is more independent and would move to high school. But eight years of age is unnecessarily cruel, and to be honest I'm quite surprised that that was a decision made by Labor. That shouldn't have been done, and I think that we need to address that urgently. It's a wicked thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this legislation, we're put in a very difficult position. Do we support the legislation that gives another three months of just a little bit extra for people who have enormous bills in January?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about you, but in January it's the time when all the bills come through the door. If you have children at school, it's new schoolbags and pencil cases and shoes and school uniforms. And the council rates come in. Everything comes in just after Christmas in January, and that's when we're reducing people down to $75 a week. So we've got two choices: do we play chicken with the government and think that they're going to actually do a permanent increase or do we accept this, knowing that on 31 March we are condemning people to abject poverty? It's a horrible decision to make, and I would urge the government to rethink their legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I want to start by echoing some of the sentiments exposed by the member for Mayo, particularly those sentiments around the beneficial elements of this bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020, in its giving ability for the continuation of the coronavirus supplement until 31 March, which is obviously something we'd like to support. Indeed, the bill has several beneficial elements. It continues the coronavirus supplement for a number of allowances—youth allowance, students and apprentices—until after December as well as increased income-free areas, tapering rates and partner income tests, which were all introduced as part of the government's package to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I also want to express here real disappointment that this bill presents a huge missed opportunity for this government to permanently raise the rate of JobSeeker. In doing so, I support the amendments put forward by the shadow minister and the member for Barton, which are aimed at getting the government to, first of all, not cut the coronavirus supplement at Christmas; second, deliver a permanent increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker payment; and, third, retain ongoing powers to keep paying the coronavirus supplement after 31 March. Let's not pretend that 31 March is some kind of cut-off rate when the pandemic is suddenly going to stop and the economic impacts of the pandemic are suddenly going to stop. The amendments also retain ongoing powers to make other beneficial changes to taper rates, income tests and eligibility criteria after 31 March 2021.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mayo made a very good point—and it's a point I often make—about the fact that, as parliamentarians, we get $280 a day or thereabouts for our travel allowance. I thank her for making that point. I think it behoves each one of us in parliament to reflect on that today—and possibly every day that we're here. That daily allowance that we get would be equivalent to a week of payment on JobSeeker if it goes back to its pre-coronavirus rate—$280 a week compared to $280 a day. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing against the fact that obviously we need a travel allowance. Yes, those of us who rent or stay in hotel accommodation do need that, but I think it's important for us as parliamentarians to reflect on just what that means: our daily rate is equivalent to what the JobSeeker rate would go down to once this coronavirus supplement has ceased—$280 a week. I ask each and every parliamentarian—there are not many in the House today, but I know that there are those who are possibly watching this in their office—to reflect on how they could live, and if they could live, on $280 a week. You're living on $280 a day today. Think about what it would be like trying to live on that for a week.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've lived on that. I've lived on that and raised two children, and it's not easy. You have to choose between putting food on the table and paying your rent. Often, you have to do that. As the member for Mayo, the member for Macarthur and the member for Wills rightly pointed out, we're moving into Christmas and, come January, the bills will pile up. You'll get your rates bills, which can be in the thousands, and the electricity bill and the gas bill. Often, you'll end up putting those bills off and try to make payment arrangements because you need to buy books to send your kids to school with. You need to buy their school uniforms and their pens and pencils and other things they need to go to school with. That can run into the hundreds of dollars as well. We're on a pretty good wicket here, and sometimes it's really easy for us to forget that there are so many Australians who are in such a dire state that even $10 is so much more significant for them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about what this bill does. We know that at the start of the pandemic the government introduced the coronavirus supplement, which was an additional $550 a fortnight. We supported all of that. In fact, we'd called for the government to have these wage and JobSeeker supports in place not just during the coronavirus supplement but even before that. Members on this side have been calling for an increase in the JobSeeker rate, and whatever it was called before then—what was it called before then?</span>

                    </a>  The Newstart rate; thank you, member for Barton. Currently, the coronavirus supplement is paid through these regulation-making powers of the minister under the Social Security Act. This bill takes that away, beyond 31 March. That's quite curious to me, because surely the impacts of this pandemic will linger beyond 31 March. I don't know why it's 31 March. It seems to be some kind of arbitrary cut-off point that the government chose. I can't quite understand why—perhaps it was picked out of a hat. I don't know. But it's clearly obvious, I think, to everybody in this place that the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are going to linger well beyond that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, in question time, the government ministers who were asked questions referred—I don't know if anyone else noticed—to the term 'comeback' quite consistently. I think it's the next most used thing after 'snapback'. Remember when they used to use snapback? Now they're saying comeback. I think that's quite telling, because it really speaks to what's going on here. We have a government that thinks it's okay to pay $30 million for a piece of land that's worth $3 million and thinks it's okay to stand up for a former senator utilising $4,000 an hour—it's not even a day, it's an hour; I don't even know what $4,000 an hour looks like—of taxpayers' money for what, essentially, is a job interview. Yes, we support an Australian in the OECD but it's a post-political career—yet the government expects a million Australians who are unemployed to make do on $40 a day. What does $40 a day buy you these days? It doesn't buy you much, really. Imagine having to pay your rent, your rates, your electricity bill and all your other bills and still buy food and—if you've got children—feed your children on $40 a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think government members' use of this term 'comeback' is telling of the philosophy behind this bill. It really amounts to abject cruelty and the dismissal of Australians who are struggling through this pandemic—Australians who have lost their jobs, as well as Australians who are in insecure employment and know that they could lose their jobs tomorrow. I think it says a lot about how this government treats them. But what do you expect from government members who think that it's okay to live on $40 a day, who think that they could do it but have never done it, and who talk about 'lifters and leaners' and 'giving a hand up, not a handout'? If that's the philosophy and the ideology with which this government approaches our robust social security system, then I really do despair for our nation. Australia is the envy of the world for its social security system and for the fact that we have a system that looks after the most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things that this bill does is remove the minister's ability to make regulations that waive the liquid assets waiting period and assets period. The government shouldn't have reinstated the liquid assets waiting period in September. That has had real consequences for people. I was approached by a resident of Cowan, a resident in my community, who had been let go from a job that he had worked in for a number of years. He got a very small redundancy payment, nothing to write home about—let me just say, it was a lot less than what some members here will get as a pension when they leave. With that, he bought a car, because he needed a car to look for work, and paid some bills, but he was unable to get JobSeeker payments because of the waiting period. He was unable to get any form of assistance because of the waiting period. With that, he faced homelessness, he faced poverty, he had to go to food banks to feed himself, and he was unable to look after his son, who he shares custody of with his ex-partner. It really had an impact on his mental health and wellbeing as well. These are the real consequences of some of the measures in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think there is a member in this House—I'd be surprised if there were—who has not had people from their electorates, like people from Cowan, come to them in a desperate state because of losing their jobs, because of being unable to find employment—particularly those over the age of 50. Let's face it: if you're over 50 and lose a job, it is so much more difficult to find a job. People have come saying that there is nothing for them, that there is nowhere for them to go, and that there is nothing for them in the government's 2020 budget to help them either find a job or get into to work to help them recover from the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I reiterate my opening points. Whilst there are many beneficial elements of this bill—and we definitely support continuing the coronavirus supplement for youth allowance after December—the amendments that the member for Barton has put forward are going to benefit all Australians. In particular, for my community in Cowan, they are amendments that we need to have to ensure that those most vulnerable members of the Cowan community are able to get through what are going to be the lingering impacts of the coronavirus. Other members have mentioned the broader economic impact of not being able to support local businesses, not being able to buy local and not being able to spend money in businesses and the flow-on impact that that'll have on businesses as well; that's another concern that I share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the amendment put forward by the member for Barton. And I urge this government very strongly to consider the fact that returning to the JobKeeper payment precoronavirus is going to have a significant impact on Australians and a flow-on impact on the economy. This time is the perfect time for us to be discussing a permanent increase to the JobSeeker payment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020 and on the amendment moved by the wonderful member for Barton, who continues to push the Morrison government for a proper safety net which actually catches people when they need it—a safety net which doesn't let people fall through the cracks, which is why we are so disappointed in this bill. It is a missed opportunity for the government to deliver a permanent increase to the base rate of unemployment support—to lift it from being punitive, poverty inducing and a barrier to getting one's life back on track—and that is why Labor has moved an amendment to call on the government to permanently increase the base rate of the JobSeeker payment and not cut the coronavirus supplement at Christmas, of all times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many beneficial elements to this bill, including continuing the coronavirus supplement for youth allowance recipients after December as well as the increase to income-free areas, taper rates and partner income tests that have been introduced as part of the pandemic. However, this bill puts in black and white the government's cruel plan to revert to pre-pandemic levels of unemployment support from March 2021. It will revert JobSeeker back to the $40-a-day rate. This is unnecessary and cruel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of this pandemic, the budget was an opportunity for the government to deliver lasting structural change for Australians needing help while boosting businesses and jobs, and they've missed that opportunity. Labor won't stand for it. We know people are doing it tough. There are 1.8 million Australians who will be relying on JobSeeker by Christmas. In my electorate of Cooper, close to 12,000 people right now are relying on JobSeeker just to survive. There are local folk who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves without a job. Some are people, quite frankly, who could have kept a job during the pandemic had the government extended JobKeeper to their industries, like the workers laid off from La Trobe University; like many casual workers; like workers in the arts and entertainment industry, of whom there are many in my electorate; and, of course, like so many women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was contacted by a constituent called Neil just recently. Neil is 53 years old. He and his wife, between them, have 35 years experience of working in the university research sector. Because JobKeeper was not extended to their sector they have both lost their jobs. They have two small children. They are not eligible, unfortunately, for JobSeeker, because they are finally at a stage in their lives—because it's very difficult in the university sector and it's very precarious, insecure work where you move from contract to contract; very few people have permanent tenure—in which they have saved enough money to put a deposit on a house. Unfortunately for them, they lost their jobs because there was no JobMaker, and they are not eligible for JobSeeker because of that small nest egg. He is 53 years old. He fears he will not be able to get another job. The JobMaker scheme, of course, as we know, is an incentive for people to employ people under 35. Neil is 53. He feels desperate, he feels let down and he feels alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody knows that it would be unthinkable to push the JobSeeker payment back to pre-pandemic levels: $40 a day is impossible to live on. It would be an act beyond forgiveness and definitely beyond the boundaries of responsible government. Constituents have told me that the extra money means being able to live without anxiety, being able to treat the kids to a new book or a new pair of shoes—let alone have a decent meal or even a meal out. One single mum told me it has meant she's been able to finally focus on setting up her own business. The increased JobSeeker, along with the short period of time when she had access to free child care, meant that she was able to sit at her desk and start that business from scratch, finally having the time to give it the attention it deserves. Imagine that: assisting someone to actually make their own way—making sure that people can eat, be healthy, be well dressed and be mentally well and ready to go out and find work and to actually stand on their own two feet. God forbid that any government would want to help people do that! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to unemployed people, the Prime Minister and his government are only interested in chasing illegal and immoral robodebts, driving people further into poverty and desperation. The Prime Minister has often tried to call on the long bow of Australian values, but they do not know the true meaning of Australian values, and it makes me furious when they pretend they do. Their values are all about dog eat dog, or kick people when they're down. If you're poor, if you're sick, if you need an education, if you're unemployed, if you're young, if you're old, if you're a woman or if you're from a migrant background, then, bad luck: you're on your own. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer let the cat out of the bag when he said he drew on Thatcher and Reagan for inspiration. The idea that governments should step aside and let markets rip is the core of his values. Decades of Thatcherism and Reaganomics have created the inequality and insecurity we face today. Wealth didn't trickle down to the masses; it flowed all the way into the deep, deep pockets of a very privileged few. 'Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps,' they say. There is one job for every eight jobseekers out there right now—a statistic that in reality is much worse given the number of employed people who are actually looking for more jobs to get by. For all of those people, the situation is dire. There just aren't enough jobs. Even if you pulled yourself up by your blooming bootstraps there still wouldn't be enough jobs. As we've pointed out in this House over and over again, this country was going downhill long before the pandemic. With insecure work, record low wages growth and rampant underemployment, this government was overseeing the weakest growth since the global financial crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about what's missing in this bill. It's jobs. We have to tackle the casualised and increasingly insecure labour market to deliver a generation of job creation and record low unemployment. The last people willing to listen to about how we need to do that are Thatcher and Reagan fans. Rather, we can turn to our own history for a blueprint of how to do it. After the Second World War, the Chifley government implemented a full employment policy, outlined in a white paper written by HC 'Nugget' Coombs. It was a tangible plan to realise the potential of all Australian workers. It begins with the simple recognition that the people of Australia will demand and are entitled to expect full employment. It places the responsibility for delivering that full employment squarely upon the government's shoulders. It committed the government to an economic framework that ensured that everyone who wanted a job could get one, and at the same time it allowed our country to welcome two million migrants from postwar Europe into the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's fanciful, I hear you and many of the younger generation say. But it was a policy that prevailed in this country for some 30 years. Even successive Liberal governments maintained it, keeping unemployment at or below two per cent. It meant pulling policy levers to get people employed, like co-investment in the automobile industry or direct government employment in utilities and the Public Service, through apprenticeships, traineeships and cadetships and through massive public works programs and smaller ones at a local government level. It's not fanciful, and with political will and acknowledgement of the failures of the neoliberal approach that has not created the resilient economy that we need, we could achieve it again. I see a sustainable future for our economy with direct investment in revitalising our energy grid, encouraging investment in wind and solar farms, building a hydrogen industry, closing the loop on our own waste management and hiring Indigenous rangers to reconnect us with traditional land use and care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A full-employment policy could support the workforce we need to regenerate our environments devastated by last summer's bushfires and help mitigate the climate emergency. It could include procurement policies that help our manufacturing sector grow and diversify so we're not reliant on global supply chains for vital products. We could increase the number of permanent workers in the public sector, including in services like Centrelink phone lines. We could clear the visa backlog. It could drive vocational training and entry-level opportunities for good, steady jobs to ensure that the NDIS and the aged-care sectors deliver for the vulnerable people in our community. A full-employment policy with a jobs compact is key to ensuring we have a workforce that is skilled, ready and able to build the infrastructure and the society of the future. Yes, it will cost money, but the return would be immeasurable. The basic economic premise that money in people's pockets is what drives the economy is sound.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a plan for jobs, but we need a good, secure safety net to go alongside that. As the member for Barton said, we think that people right across this chamber, in their heart of hearts, know that the base rate of JobSeeker is too low. It will return millions of Australians to poverty. The effects of poverty stay with people for life, and the idea that somehow or other you can just pull your socks up, strap your shoes on and get on with life is not the reality for many people living in this country. We in this place, elected representatives, have a duty to those people. We have a duty of care and we have the capacity to make their lives ones of dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge those who sit opposite to consider the amendments to this bill. We can pull people out of poverty. We can give people the opportunity to ready themselves for jobs, to find work, to start their own businesses, to make sure that they actually have some bootstraps to pull up, to make sure that their children have all the opportunities that a secure life can give them: a roof over their heads, plenty of food on the table, a good education and parents that are not absolutely strung out with anxiety because they don't have the income and the means to provide that for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Society needs nothing more than a secure job and a good social safety net that protects you when for a reason out of your own control you find yourself without a job. Mr Deputy Speaker Wallace, I commend these amendments to you and to the government. They need your support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020. Everyone agrees we are managing the health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis well in Australia. Thanks to Australians listening to the medical advice from experts and following the restrictions implemented by their home state or territory, we are for the most part COVID free. It's been wonderful seeing over the last couple of weeks the images of families and friends being reunited after being separated for months. So, from a health perspective, Australia is currently in a very good position. However, it is a far different story when it comes to the subsequent economic recession we are in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you looked at just the reports of a booming stock market, surging property prices and the reduction in the number of people receiving JobKeeper, you could be fooled into thinking we were back to normal. In fact, I think that in question time today the Treasurer will spruik the GDP figures that came out today that returned only half of the damage to the economy that we have suffered over the last nine months. But nothing could be further from the truth. That's been one of the strangest things about this recession. Certain industries and sectors have shown very positive signs of recovery; however, for significant and growing portions of our community, their circumstances are very grim—much grimmer than they were at the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last fortnight I've had the privilege to visit some wonderful organisations helping the growing number of vulnerable people in Shortland. Many of my constituents might be surprised that there are food banks and distribution centres in our community. I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the wonderful volunteers at Belmont community kitchen, OzHarvest at Windale, Manna House, Survivor's R Us and Southlake Marketplace for the truly magnificent work they are doing in the community I have the privilege to represent. At this time of year, particularly in this recession, many people are doing it tough, and these wonderful organisations, supported by their incredible volunteers, make an immeasurable impact and difference to the lives of so many people. Throughout this pandemic they have seen and heard firsthand how many people in my community are struggling. I want to thank all these volunteers for being there for those in need in our community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The feedback I've received from the managers of the local food banks I just mentioned was very disturbing, and I was reminded this recession is far from over, and that's the context for both the debate around this legislation and the second reading amendment moved by the member for Barton. The clients of the food banks are facing a much more difficult situation than they were six months ago, and this is directly linked to the government's cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker. There are 1.6 million Australians relying on the JobSeeker unemployment support, with the government predicting 1.8 million will be on JobSeeker by the end of the year. There are a further 1.5 million Australians on JobKeeper. The latest data from the ABS, released last month, show that the official unemployment rate rose to seven per cent, that over 10 per cent of Australians are still underemployed and that the proportion of people looking for work increased. There are 2.4 million Australians who are either out of work or desperately needing more work—this year is an historic high. The figures we've seen this year, including the 2.4 million, overshadow any previous figures for this measure—2.4 million Australians out of work or desperately needing more hours to meet their financial commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Shortland, we have about 8,000 JobSeeker recipients and an estimated 17,000 who depend upon JobKeeper, so nearly 30 per cent of all Shortland residents aged between 15 and 65 depend upon one of these payments that the government has cut. And this brings me to the feedback I received from the food banks in my electorate. Ann-Maria from Survivor's R Us at Cardiff told me that at the height of the lockdown they were providing food packages to around 150 families. They have seen a massive spike in demand since the government's cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker in late September. They are now providing food packages to over 450 families. Just reflect upon that for a moment: demand from families in danger of starving tripled at exactly the same time this government cut JobKeeper and JobSeeker. This is no coincidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I received similar evidence from Christine from Southlake Marketplace. Christine was literally in tears as she explained the massive surge in demand for their food parcels. Southlake Marketplace were assisting 400 families at the height of the lockdown. Immediately after the September cuts, this surged to around a thousand families in need of assistance to have enough food. Let me restate that: demand for help with the basics of life is at 250 per cent the level of pre-September cuts because of this government's decisions around JobKeeper and JobSeeker. Christine also made the point that they cannot currently meet the demand for Christmas hampers and toys for families and kids in our area. She was distraught at the thought of turning away families, meaning kids would not receive a Christmas present. It's obvious that families in my community are hurting because of deliberate decisions of this Liberal-National government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker are a deliberate act of cruelty by this craven, out-of-touch government, and I do not say that lightly. This cruelty means thousands of families in my community would be at risk of starvation without the intervention of charities like those in the electorate that I've mentioned previously. The government has chosen to cut JobKeeper and JobSeeker at the worst possible time. Removing much-needed support to those who need it the most is bad economics and disgusting social policy, and it's a damning indictment on this government. To make matters worse, we're hearing stories of families being evicted from their homes despite an eviction moratorium being officially extended by the New South Wales government. Loan deferrals have also been ended by many banks, meaning those families with mortgages are also facing grim circumstances. Many are not only struggling to put food on their table; they are struggling to keep a roof over their head. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon the government to stop these cuts, which will go deeper in the new year, to ensure that families in my electorate and around Australia can have food on the table and a roof over their heads at Christmas. I am extremely concerned about the further cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker and the impact they will have on those who are already struggling. This recession is having huge impacts on people's mental health and wellbeing. Many support services have spoken about the significant increase in demand for their services. This will only get worse when the support payments are reduced and JobKeeper is removed altogether. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, just yesterday there was a report about the rise in domestic violence in Australia during the COVID pandemic. This is something that the local food banks in my community are very aware of as well. Christine from Southlake Marketplace said that the spike in domestic violence is something she'd never seen before. Out of the hundreds of new people she has been helping during the pandemic, she estimated that one-third of them are women who have fled domestic violence. Similarly, Ann-Maria from Survivor's R Us said the number of domestic violence victims seeking support from her organisation has increased 65 per cent during the pandemic. These are devastating figures and they are happening right across our nation. One of the main reasons for this increase in domestic violence is unemployment and financial stress and, again, this will only get worse when JobKeeper and JobSeeker are cut in the new year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's new JobMaker hiring credit won't fix the financial struggles that so many people are facing. Despite their initial claims that JobMaker will create 450,000 jobs, Treasury recently conceded that it will actually only be around 45,000 jobs. That's nowhere near enough to address the unemployment crisis. About 2.4 million Australians are out of work or desperately needing more hours versus 45,000 new jobs under JobMaker. That's before you consider that there are 928,000 Australians aged over 35 on unemployment benefits who have been deliberately excluded from the scheme by this cruel government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This economic crisis is far from over, yet this government is planning on removing crucial support from those who need it the most. It's symbolic of this government's attempt to pass the baton of the economic recovery from government to business and consumers—and they're doing it in a very ham-fisted way. They're cutting direct government support to people who need that money the most—to people who literally spend every dollar they receive from the government, thereby stimulating the local economy. As I said, 25,000 Shortland residents in receipt of JobKeeper or JobSeeker will have those payments cut or disappear directly, pulling millions of dollars a fortnight out of the Shortland economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the government is embarking on their very courageous investment allowance to stimulate business investment. The challenges for that investment allowance which go to the recovery from the coronavirus recession—which is at the heart of the debate on this legislation—is that first off, businesses, even if they get 100 per cent instant asset write-off, are going to be very reluctant to invest in new pieces of equipment unless they're sure that they will get new customers to buy the products from that new machinery. If businesses have very little confidence in the economy—and we are seeing cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker that will actually deprive money from their customers—why would businesses invest in new pieces of equipment?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, if you look at the distributional impact of who will use this investment allowance, the businesses that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID recession aren't capital intensive businesses; they're cafes, hotels, accommodation, bars and bistros. For many of these places the biggest piece of capital equipment they are likely to invest in might be a new fridge or a new coffee machine, whereas this investment allowance is obviously much more relevant to capital intensive manufacturing, for example, where a facility might spend $5 million on a new laser cutting machine. So even if a business thought they had the customers to justify new investment, this investment allowance is targeted at businesses that were not impacted by the COVID recession as directly as those in hospitality or accommodation. This is one of the flaws with trying to pass the baton of the economic recovery away from government to business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another impact would be where the personal tax cuts are targeted. Targeting those tax cuts at middle- and high-income earners, as this government has done, will be less effective than providing direct assistance to low-income earners. The marginal propensity to save is higher for high-income earners. In plain in English, if you're on a high income you can save more of your income than someone on a low income. By targeting these tax cuts to high-income earners, some of that money will inevitably leak out of the economy into savings rather than be recirculating through consumption, thereby stimulating the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The philosophical underpinnings of this legislation, which is effectively a cut to JobSeeker, coupled with the fact that JobKeeper will be abolished early in the new year, really highlight the flawed approach that this government has adopted to recovering from the recession. It's a recession where we still have 2.4 million Australians who are either out of work or who want more hours, we have up to a tripling in demand for the services of food banks and we've had huge spikes in domestic violence. And what is this government's response? To cut government assistance, and to cut government assistance at the worst possible time. Labor, on the other hand, has called for a more balanced approach: a permanent increase to the JobSeeker payment; investment in things that enhance productivity and labour force participation like child care; a reinvestment in Australian manufacturing to bring those jobs home; and investment in reducing power prices through the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation initiative. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is flawed. Labor has made known our view about what parts of it we will support. Justice demands a permanent increase in the JobSeeker supplement, not just so those families can survive but, quite frankly, so the economy can recover. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to speak to some of the matters in the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020. Obviously there are some things that we support and things we would like to see done differently, and I will talk to some of those points. Essentially, this bill is a missed opportunity, as so many bills have been during the response to COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a missed opportunity to deliver a permanent increase to the base rate of the unemployment benefit. I don't think anyone in this chamber seriously believes that it is possible to do anything other than, possibly, subsist for a short time on the paltry $40 a day that is the current permanent base rate. I think we all recognise that there is terrible hardship amongst those who experience unemployment, especially those who experience it in the long-term. For people who live outside Sydney, in regions like mine on the edge of Sydney, that entire base rate amount could go on your transport cost to get to a single job interview. Those sorts of costs mean that you can't afford to get employed. You can't afford to stay unemployed, but you can't afford to get employed. We're creating terrible mental health and economic consequences for people, and this bill is a missed opportunity to address some of those things. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other concern that I want to address in a bit more detail is the plan to take away so many of the other supports that were put in place, which the minister was given the power to do to respond and react to COVID. Taking away the minister's ability to pay the coronavirus supplement after 31 March means that there will be millions of families still carrying the scars of the economic impact of the pandemic who will have no hope of getting back on their feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The timing of this, around Christmas, is curious. This is a time when we want to encourage a boost in retail spending. We want to encourage people to pump money into their local shops. Yet the time frame that the government's put on this means it's a real dampener on what we might otherwise see. I know that my local shops, from the top of the mountains down to the bottom of the mountains, across to Windsor and Richmond and into the smaller villages, are hoping to see people feeling confident enough to spend money over Christmas and through January. Keep in mind that 12 months ago our local economy stopped because of bushfires in November. By November and early December last year, we'd lost houses, the place was covered in smoke and international visitors had stopped coming. So we're 12 months into an economic catastrophe for many businesses. Of course, the wage subsidy that we pushed for, JobKeeper, has helped maintain the viability of some businesses through this period, but they were coming off a very low base. If their community, which relies on JobSeeker, has less money to spend, that's going to directly show up in their daily tallies, in their daily turnover, and they'll feel that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of the pandemic, the government introduced the coronavirus supplement, that additional payment of $550 a fortnight to those who were receiving the unemployment support, as well as to single parents and students. People told me that made an enormous difference. People were able to pay not only their rent but also their electricity bills. They were able in some cases to get ahead on some of their bills. We've already had 40-degree days in Western Sydney and Greater Western Sydney, so people know their bills are going to be higher because they need to use their air-conditioning, if they have it, or fans or other things to cool down. They know it pays to get ahead in their bills. People did that, and people are really proud of the fact that they've been able to do some planning ahead in some cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had parents tell me they were able to buy new shoes for their kids. That always comes up as being one of the fundamental things that you want to be able to do as a parent—to give your kids the shoes they need as their feet grow and grow and grow. I remember, from when my kids were little and I was just starting a business, the pressure to try and keep those kids' feet in shoes. How people do that on unemployment benefit or the payments that they receive is anyone's guess. The fact is that they haven't been able to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coronavirus supplement really made a difference and gave people a sense of hope. I know that, for one young woman, the supplement meant she was able to cease being homeless. She was able to get a small place of accommodation that she could afford in the Hawkesbury. It's a notoriously expensive area in which to live, especially across the river, but she was able to find something. But, through one of the agencies supporting her, we now hear that, as the supplement reduces, she is recognising she won't be able to maintain that home. She will, in her mind, just have to go back to being homeless. That is an absolute travesty—that someone has had a taste of what it's like to get their life back together by having a roof over their head and this government seems to have no qualms in taking that away from people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the impact of the pandemic is going to persist for many years. Some people will probably have snapped back; some may have done what the government envisaged was going to be the economic strategy early on. But for every snapback we know that there are some who may never make it back. The message I keep hearing from the groups supporting vulnerable people is that those who they see as traditionally vulnerable have become even more vulnerable throughout this period. If we look at the number of people relying on unemployment support, we know that is still going to be elevated in four years time. There are not enough jobs. This government has not got a plan in place to help stimulate job creation or create jobs directly. So we know there will not be enough jobs for people. Right now there are eight people for every available job. Yet we're saying: 'If you're one of the seven who can't find work, that's just too bad. The tap is being turned off.' It's unnecessary and it's cruel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we in this place have to recognise that the increase has done a couple of things. It has helped people financially, it has helped them within themselves and it has helped them with their own mental health in being able to feel a sense of hope and a sense of purpose. They are three really good things. In fact, I'm happy to congratulate the government on recognising the need for a supplement. But I am so disappointed that the government's goodwill in doing that doesn't extend to going forward into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the timing of the pulling away of this support: in Labor senators' additional comments in the report of the Senate inquiry into this bill, I particularly noted the comments by Anglicare Australia. Anglicare said to that inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… officials from the Department of Social Services talk about the kinds of numbers that they were expecting to see unemployed in April—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the comments of Ms Chambers, from Anglicare—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They were predicting an increase from what we're seeing today. So, as to pulling these benefits back, we are arguing—I do need to be clear about this—for a permanent increase—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">in the JobSeeker payment—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the meantime, it is clearly not the time to be pulling this back. And not only that, but, as to the timing and the actual date that we're looking at this decrease coming in, we know, from decades of data, that, in emergency relief and in financial counselling services, January is always the peak for those services. It is an expensive time of year for families. There's preparation for the school year. There are increased costs in cooling their dwellings, especially in the last couple of summers we've had. There are Christmas peaks. There are all those kinds of things. So, even down to the month and the day, it is not the right time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why won't the government listen to the data from reputable organisations? Every month of the year, they're out there helping people. They don't just turn up at Christmas; they are there the whole time. And they're saying that this is the worst possible time to be pulling these supports away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke with the CEO of Foodbank in the last week or so. They have identified so many problems with the current situation and the government's plan for reducing relief. Foodbank says, 'Demand for food relief is up, and we believe we have not yet seen peak hunger in the COVID-19 crisis.' While charities are seeing the need for food relief become erratic and unpredictable, the overall demand to the end of September was up by an average of 47 per cent from pre-COVID days. Charities are reporting a further jump of 25 per cent since JobSeeker and JobKeeper were reduced at the end of September. The latest dashboard figures I received, for November, say that charities are anticipating a 45 per cent increase in people seeking food relief this Christmas versus the same time last year. To meet the Christmas demand they expect they will need 41 per cent more food. So yet more evidence that this is a time of year when people really need support, yet this is the very time of year the government has chosen to pull away these supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within my community, the organisations that are going to feel this most are not just the people who provide Christmas Day meals—those groups like Belong Blue Mountains and all the different people who even in COVID times have found a way to deliver a Christmas meal—but those people who are constantly out there with food parcels. HCOS, Hawkesbury's Helping Hands, Hawkesbury Community Kitchen and The Living Room are all seeing increases—everyone from Gateway Family Services at the bottom of the mountains to Junction 142 at the top. These are the organisations that will pay the price, in fact, for the government's decisions here. So I really urge the government to think about the timing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other gap in this legislation is that it still provides nothing for older workers who have essentially been left out, overlooked by the government, workers like Marco who I spoke about in question time a few weeks ago who's just a little over 35—in fact maybe a decade or two over 35. He's not old enough for older worker support but he's too old for the additional support the government's providing for young jobseekers. It's unfathomable that you would rule out an entire category of people, one million of them, who just aren't going to get any additional assistance when they actually represent the largest cohort of jobseekers. They have the most difficult time finding work because of structural barriers and age discrimination. And that's not new; that's something older workers have come and spoken to me about since I've been a member of parliament. In the last 18 years the proportion of people who are over 55 on unemployment payments has gone from 8.8 per cent to 26.6 per cent—so it's more than tripled. Currently there are more than 307,000 people who are over 50 on unemployment support and they're having the most trouble getting off the payment—a missed opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big gap is clearly that, alongside pulling back the supports, there's no corresponding focus on jobs and training. What we could be seeing from this government is a real drive for jobs in the renewable energy sector. We could be seeing jobs being created with a social housing program to upgrade and build new social housing, so that people like the woman who I fear is going to become homeless as the supplement supports are pulled away have somewhere safe that they can go. We could be funding people to help the environment recover from the devastating bushfires we had. There has been so little on-the-ground assistance flowthrough from this government for bushfire recovery in World Heritage areas. The volunteers are out there; they're working their guts out. They need support from this government. That's the missed opportunity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020 is a largely unnecessary bill. The government actually doesn't need to pass most of it; it's a stunt. The government think they're being clever mixing up a few nice things with a whole lot of nasty things, but they don't even have the guts, the courage, to tell people what this bill is actually about. They're bundling things up in one bill and going, 'Well, if they vote for it, then we can say they're voting for cuts; and if they don't vote for it, then we'll say they're voting against nice things.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few things, sure, we should vote for. I don't think they actually need the power to continue the coronavirus supplement for youth allowance after December. They could probably do that; the minister almost certainly has the power to do that. But they wanted to put nice stuff in it: continued increases for income-free areas, taper rates, partner income tests—fine, good. Vote for it. They probably don't need the power, given the extraordinary emergency powers that the minister got at the start of this year to do these kinds of things during this pandemic, this national emergency. So they already have a lot of these powers but actually what this is about, astoundingly, is taking the minister's powers away—the very powers that have been used through the pandemic to provide the coronavirus supplement, to provide the increases to social security payments. The government thinks it's being clever. They don't actually want to put a bill before the parliament that says, 'We're going to cut unemployment benefits to $40 a day,' because people might actually clue in that that's exactly what they're going to do. All they're going to say is: 'Oh, we're just adjusting the minister's powers.' If these powers go, if this bill is voted up, in practice what it will do is implement a massive horrible, nasty cut to unemployment benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill implements, in effect, the budget that the government just handed down; it bakes in cuts to unemployment benefits for well over a million Australians trying to survive on the unemployment benefit right now. It bakes in a cut to the unemployment benefit back to the old rate of $40 a day. I don't believe anyone in this House can imagine living on $40 a day. I don't think I could live on $40 a day. The evidence says anyone who tries to live on $40 a day cannot actually survive without ending up in poverty. This is a cruel, nasty, mean, vicious, vindictive and downright unfair cut by the government—a government too cowardly to even come here and fess up that that's what they're actually doing. I haven't heard many government members with the guts to come in and say: 'What we want to do is cut unemployment benefits to $40 a day. That's what we're voting for.' They buried it in technicalities and little weasel words, but that's exactly what this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no exaggeration to say that this is the single greatest act by any Australian government to push 1.5 million Australians into poverty. That's what will happen if this bill is passed. Let's be very clear on that. I can think of no other thing any Australian government has done—no single act, no piece of legislation passed by this House—that has, with one vote, pushed more Australians into poverty in one go. In my electorate, well over 20,000 people rely on this coronavirus supplement to boost their income support payments. So, if this bill is passed, what we're saying to those people is: 'You had $550 extra a fortnight that finally got you out of poverty so you could pay your bills and eat. We cut it to $250, and a few weeks ago we cut that to $150, and now we want to cut it to zero dollars, to push it back to $40 a day—$565 a fortnight. Good luck to you!'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The context for this is critical. The government's own budget—these are not my numbers; these are the government's numbers—says 1.3 million Australians are relying on unemployment benefits in some form. That was when the budget was handed down at the start of October, and then, a couple of weeks later, they said, 'Well, by Christmas, it's going to be 1.5 million Australians.' Then, three weeks ago in Senate estimates, they had to fess up: 'Actually, by Christmas, 1.8 million Australians are going to be relying on, and trying to live on, unemployment benefits.' These are the government's own numbers. At the very time when more Australians than ever before in the history of our country need help from the government, the government is in here cutting support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning we saw that the national accounts showed growth, and that's welcome. Growth is returning—3.3 per cent. No doubt in an hour the government is going to come in and trumpet this as if everything's tickety-boo: 'It's all on the way up. We're all recovering.' They going to say 'comeback' to every question, as we heard yesterday from the marketing department, the spin department—that thing that masquerades as a government. They'll say: 'It's all on the comeback. It's all tickety-boo.' Try telling that this Christmas to the projected 1.8 million Australians who are going to be trying to live on unemployment benefits knowing what's coming down the pipe because of this government's budget—a cut to $40 a day. How do you think their budgeting is going to go? And the government wonders why people call it the 'Morrison recession'. Of course there was going to be a recession with the global pandemic, but we call it the Morrison recession because it's deeper, it's harder, it's darker, it's longer and it's harsher because of this government's failure to act and now because of their efforts to cut the support that they put in. That's what this bill does: $40 a day. I really can't understand it. It actually makes no logical sense. Everyone in this country knows the rate was already too low. Those radical socialists at the Business Council of Australia said the rate was too low. ACOSS said the rate was too low. Even their former leader, former conservative Prime Minister John Howard, said the rate was too low and had to be raised. It's a disincentive to work. People in my electorate and right across the country face those dreadful choices: 'How do I afford clothes to go to job interview? How do I maintain my health? How am I going to afford this $7.70 train ticket to get across the city to get to the job interview? It's a trade-off between that and the $5 co-payment to buy my pharmaceuticals for the week for my kid.' That's what real people in the country face, but the government's response is: 'Don't worry about it. Ignore the evidence. Ignore everyone else in the country. We know best; we'll cut it to $40 a day.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the positive impact of the coronavirus supplement. The small, volunteer-run local food charities that I went around and saw during the pandemic said that, for the first time in living memory, they were not seeing every week the same people on Newstart coming in and asking for food vouchers because finally they had enough money to buy food. They saw a whole bunch of new people who were excluded by the government—casual workers, temporary migrants and a whole lot of other people come in, and the queues weren't shorter—but it proved that giving people that level of money to live with pulled them out of poverty. It also is dumb economics; it jeopardises the recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know every dollar given to people on social security is a dollar spent in the local economy. To be putting the economic recovery at risk and actually cutting jobs, in effect, in local communities is profoundly dumb when we think about the shared desire across the House to support small business and to support the economic recovery because money is not going to flow. I know in my community 22,000 people next year will have $250 less a fortnight to spend at the shops. What do the government think that's going to do for unemployment? It also confirms this is a wasted recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reform in this budget at all. The government have blown $98 billion, a record of new spending in the budget this year. There's no reform; a trillion dollars of debt, hurtling towards $1.7 trillion of Liberal debt by the end of the decade; not a single idea for change; no jobs plan; no investment in the energy grid; no modernisation; and a whole bunch of slogans we get for manufacturing from the mob that chased the car industry out of Australia. Apparently, manufacturing is important to them now. It's all marketing and spin. There is no direct job creation. They put all the effort into tax cuts, and there's absolutely a place for stimulus through tax cuts, but it's not enough. The government also have a role in direct job creation—in stimulating the economy and spending money directly on job creation. The vision of the government, of course, is for a snapback—'Let's get everything back to just how it was at the start of the pandemic.' Believing their own projections, in four years, unemployment might be back to where it was before the recession took hold. But Australians deserve something much better. They deserve a better economy than we had before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we went into this recession, the economy was weak. The government would like you to forget that. Underemployment was at record levels, with over 1.6 million people not having enough hours of work; business investment had plummeted; wage growth was at record lows, anaemic at best, and has now plummeted to zero; and casualisation was at a record levels. Who knew sick leave had a purpose? The pandemic has taught us one thing as a society, as a country: perhaps it should be that sick leave had a purpose. There's actually a purpose for decent employment conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You saw the government's response to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews's fantastic announcement in his budget that he was going to trial a pilot of a scheme for gig workers and casual workers where they may get five days a year of sick leave, the right to be sick. Surely if the industrial revolution back hundreds of years ago gave us anything, it was the right for workers to be sick and not lose their house, be able to feed themselves and, as we learnt, not go to work and infect the rest of the community with a virus. It says everything you know about the government that they reject these ideas. We can be a better, fairer society where people can live on social security and feed themselves and their families when they can't get a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Newstart, JobSeeker or whatever you call it raises a question, doesn't it? The Prime Minister loves renaming things. His biggest effort, I think, at the start of the pandemic was to not get the wage subsidy in. He resisted that. There were 100,000 more people who went on the unemployment queue because he was too proud to accept Labor's advice that he should have a wage subsidy. He eventually announced one a couple of weeks later, JobKeeper. That will go in March. There will be nothing left for the international education sector and nothing left for the travel sector. A lot of sectors are going to take a lot longer to recover, but they're in the sight of the gun in March. He renamed 'Newstart' 'JobSeeker'. I wonder if now that he's cutting the rate back to $40 a day he'll change it back to Newstart. We might have JobSeeker gone and we might get Newstart back. That would be a moment of honesty. His TAFE cuts got renamed JobTrainer. We had JobMaker, or 'JobFaker', which was going to help 450,000 people, he told us, except his own officials said in Senate estimates that it was actually 45,000 people—so a factor of 10 exaggeration from the marketing guy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are taking a big political bet with this. You saw how freaked out they were, at the start of the pandemic, about the idea that middle-class Australia might actually discover what it's like to live on $40 a day: 'It's alright for people in Labor electorates and a few buried in National Party electorates in the country, isn't it, because they have no-one else to vote for. That's alright, but we couldn't have middle-class Australia living on $40 a day. Better give them a coronavirus supplement.' So we're taking a bet—aren't we, government?—that everything will be back to normal when you make these cuts in March.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's rationale is twofold. They have two talking points on this: 'We can't afford it,' and, 'It's a disincentive to work.' We can't afford it? What a load of rubbish! You're running up $1.7 trillion of debt. Budgets are about choices and priorities—$4,000 an hour to fly Mathias Cormann around Europe in a luxury government jet; government subsidies for Clive Palmer's jet; government subsidies for JobKeeper so executives can pay themselves bonuses from the companies reaping millions from JobKeeper; $30 million for a piece of land worth $3 million; and tax cuts. Tax cuts have a place, but we in this House, when the government's tax cuts are fully implemented, get a tax cut of $16,000 a year. I did the maths on that. That's $43 a day. For each of us, the tax cut that this government has passed as its priority is bigger per day than the government says someone on Newstart has to live on. That's a disgrace. That says everything you need to know about this government's priorities. So don't believe their marketing spin that the country can't afford to keep people out of poverty. It's a matter of choices and priorities. They say it's a disincentive. Well, there aren't enough jobs. There are seven jobseekers for every job. It doesn't matter whether you cut the rate or raise the rate; it's not going to create more jobs. Indeed, cutting the rate in this way will mean fewer jobs in local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the disincentive argument is not the only argument. It's also about poverty and adequacy. The rate is not adequate to keep people out of poverty, and we have to pay attention to that. Interestingly, there's some analysis. What we've had in a public policy sense with the coronavirus supplement is a great experiment. We had an experiment where we actually put some more money in and we could measure its effects. So what impact has that had on the labour market? It's made no difference to the employment market. Professor Jeff Borland summarised his recent research on the impact of the coronavirus supplement on the labour market as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One is that you could have a substantial increase in JobSeeker without adversely affecting incentives to take up paid work … and … there is no evidence that the higher level of JobSeeker during 2020, with the COVID-19 supplement, has had any appreciable effect on incentives to take up paid work for the people who are receiving JobSeeker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an understatement to say I'm disappointed, but I'm not surprised. This is who the Liberal Party is. Cutting the social safety net of this country is what they get out of bed for. It's in their DNA. It's who they are as a party. They exist to protect the people who already have wealth. Don't believe the rhetoric about aspiration. That's to cloak the reality that they exist to protect the people who already have wealth. They've never, ever come in here and increased social security payments for the people who need it most; they've only cut. They pick on the most vulnerable. With robodebt, they were using the power of the state and the Commonwealth logo to scare the bejesus out of people by sending them fake debt notices. But even for the Liberal Party this is a new low: cutting unemployment payments to $40 a day and pushing 1.5 million Australians into poverty. Shame on the government!</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020 and to support the amendment moved by the member for Barton. This bill is a missed opportunity for the government to permanently increase the base rate of unemployment support, and that is why Labor is moving an amendment calling on the government to permanently increase the base rate of JobSeeker payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are beneficial elements to this bill, including continuing the coronavirus supplement for youth allowance recipients after December, as well as the increased income-free areas, taper rates and partner income tests that have been introduced as part of the pandemic response. However, this bill confirms the government's cruel plan to snap back to pre-pandemic levels of unemployment support from 31 March next year. Taking payments back to pre-pandemic levels will hurt around two million Australians: people who've lost their jobs or whose businesses have folded, single parents and students. Vulnerable people in crisis are more at risk because of this government's decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ends the minister's ability to pay the coronavirus supplement after 31 March 2021, when we know that millions of people and families will still be hurting from the economic impact of the pandemic. Labor will be moving amendments aimed at getting the government to not cut the coronavirus supplement at Christmas, to deliver a permanent increase to the base rate of JobSeeker payment, to retain ongoing powers to keep paying the coronavirus supplement after 31 March 2021, and to make other beneficial changes to taper rates, the income test and eligibility criteria after 31 March next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will end the minister's power to indefinitely extend the coronavirus supplement after the end of March next year. At the start of the pandemic the government introduced the coronavirus supplement. There is a $550 fortnight additional payment to those receiving unemployment support as well as to single parents and students. Labor supported this additional payment, which was urgently needed, not just because of the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic but because unemployment payments were simply too low to live on. They were forcing people and families into poverty, some of the most vulnerable people in Australia, particularly in regional and remote Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the coronavirus supplement is paid to most people through regulation-making powers the minister has under the Social Security Act 1991. The impact of the pandemic will clearly persist for many years, with the Department of Social Services expecting the number of people relying on unemployment benefits and unemployment support to still be higher in four years time. Not only is a permanent increase in the base rate needed but the minister should also have the flexibility to continue the coronavirus supplement for as long as the impact of the pandemic persists and impacts those most vulnerable people in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year Labor negotiated with the government for a separate power to be included in the Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Act 2020, enabling the minister to make other changes to the social security system to help people impacted by the virus. This power ends on 31 December this year. This bill extends this power but only until 31 March next year. Labor supports this extension, but this power needs to continue for as long as the impact of the pandemic persists on our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this power, which Labor insisted on, the government has been able to: introduce more generous partner income tests for JobSeeker payment, which Labor negotiated—and we're advised that around 100,000 people are benefiting from this, including 40,000 who would not otherwise have been eligible for any support during this global crisis; make changes to the JobSeeker and youth allowance personal income tests, which provide an income-free area of $300 per fortnight compared to the pre-pandemic income-free area of $106 per fortnight, something, we're advised, around 15,000 people are currently benefiting from; make changes to the JobSeeker and youth allowance eligibility criteria so sole traders, the self-employed and permanent employees who have been stood down, and people self-isolating because they or someone they are caring for has been affected by the pandemic continue to be eligible for payment; extend the time people can maintain eligibility for payment and keep concession cards; and make other beneficial changes relating to pension portability, mobility allowance and self-declaration for couple assessments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill removes the minister's ability to make regulations that waive the liquid assets test waiting period and the assets waiting period. The government should not have reinstated the liquid assets waiting period in September, and they should drop their cruel plan to make people wait 26 weeks to get unemployment support if they have even the most modest savings. It's a false economy. It means people are forced to run down their savings, to dwindle them, and it makes it more likely they will struggle to keep a roof over their heads or keep the car on the road or food on the table. It also means people are more likely to need to rely on other support from charity, like Foodbank, or emergency relief. Labor has called on the government to continue the liquid assets waiting period suspension. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred and sixty thousand Australians are expected to lose their jobs by the end of the year, and 1.8 million Australians are expected to be relying on unemployment support by Christmas. On the Central Coast of New South Wales in my community, there are nearly 19,000 people receiving JobSeeker and over 2,500 young people currently supported through youth allowance. There are 4,000 fewer jobs on the Central Coast than there were in February this year. Coastal communities, like mine, were severely impacted by the pandemic. Retail, hospitality and tourism have had a severe hit. Over 4,000 businesses are still relying on JobKeeper and 15,000 workers are relying completely—entirely—on JobKeeper payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has missed a huge opportunity for Australians doing it tough by not making a permanent increase to JobSeeker in this bill and giving the most vulnerable Australians certainty—giving them some security and peace of mind. With more than seven jobseekers for every job vacancy across Australia, there are simply not enough jobs for everyone who needs one. It's even more difficult to find a job outside of big cities, in regional areas or the outer suburbs. In my community on the Central Coast there are 15 jobseekers for every vacancy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians relying on government support face an anxious and uncertain time this Christmas. They'll have less money to spend in local businesses, meaning less spending in the local economy. I visited The Entrance Neighbourhood Centre in my electorate this year in the middle of the pandemic. I spoke to them about the support they were offering, particularly to women and families. They said to me that, for the first time that they could recall, there were fewer parents coming in with electricity bills or needing support with groceries. Having this increase, this coronavirus supplement, has been a real benefit to people who were otherwise living in poverty and did not have enough to get by. To think that, whilst we're still feeling the impacts of the pandemic, this is going to be cut away! People, particularly women who are sole parents of families, are really going to be in crisis. It's just not fair. It puts them and their children at risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there are older workers. In my community, one in five people are aged over 65. It's a popular place for older people to live, but it's also a hard place for an older person to get a job. If you find yourself out of work, if your business has folded or if the company you work for has reduced your hours to zero, what are you going to do? There are 15 jobseekers for every vacancy, and there's an incentive from the government to employ younger workers. The budget left out Australians on JobSeeker aged over 35. Almost one million Australians are ineligible for the wage subsidy. Older Australians are the largest group receiving JobSeeker. As I mentioned, in communities like mine there are 15 jobseekers for every job that's available, there is now an incentive for a business to take on a younger person, and structural barriers and age discrimination already exist. Where does that leave these older workers? It leaves them out in the cold. In the last 18 years, the proportion of people receiving unemployment payments who were over 55 has gone from 8.8 per cent to 26.6 per cent. It has more than trebled, and that has only made it worse for people looking for work in this crisis. There are currently an estimated 307,000 people over 55 receiving unemployment support, and they will be the ones who have the most trouble finding work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to turn to how the proposals in this legislation really impact people living with mental health problems in Australia. On 16 November, the government finally released the Productivity Commission's final report into mental health, months after it received it. As was noted in chapter 19, 'Income and employment support':</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most people who experience mild to moderate mental illness are able to manage their illness and mitigate its effect on their employment. But for some, especially those with more severe illnesses, there are barriers to employment at the individual and community levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The clear and known link between financial distress and mental health crisis is, sadly, well established. Many Australians have experienced mental health distress and mental health crisis for the first time this year due to the economic impacts of the pandemic—because they're newly unemployed, because they've been reduced to a zero-hour contract or because their business has collapsed. The increase to JobSeeker payment has helped to ease this distress and helped to mitigate some of the extreme mental health impacts of this crisis. The Prime Minister has spoken many times in this House and elsewhere about his commitment to the mental health and wellbeing of all Australians, and I believe he is genuine. However, the decision to cut income support fails to do this. It undermines it. It means Australians who have relied on this support in the aftermath of the pandemic, as it continues to unfold and we still feel its impact, now face another hurdle and another risk to their mental health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same day as the Productivity Commission report into mental health was released, the government also released the interim advice from the National Suicide Prevention Adviser. The introduction of the adviser is welcome, as is the government's 'towards zero' goal for suicide prevention. Any life lost to suicide is one too many. Recommendation 7.2 of the interim advice is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Develop a Commonwealth process for reviewing new policies or initiatives to ensure they assess any impacts (positively or negatively) on suicidal risk or behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If that lens were applied to this legislation, it would fall short, because this legislation—dropping and cutting support to the most vulnerable people in the middle of a pandemic—risks their mental health and wellbeing and that of those around them. Cutting the rate of support for vulnerable Australians in the middle of an economic downturn, in the worst recession in 90 years—in living memory—is unlikely to help the government in its goal towards reducing suicidal ideation and suicide. Government announcements of increased funding for mental health services or direct provision of mental health services, and better access to them, are of course welcome and necessary, and often overdue. But, until the government begins to consider the consequences of policies like this, it will continue to fall short of its own aspirations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a missed opportunity. It is a wasted opportunity for the government to deliver a permanent increase to unemployment payments. It also puts vulnerable people at risk. It puts vulnerable people at risk and it lays bare the government's plan for unemployment and other payments to go back to their pre-pandemic rates on 31 March 2021. This is why Labor have moved amendments, why we are calling on the government to stop its Christmas cut to unemployment payments and to announce a permanent increase to give people peace of mind, to give them certainty, to give them and their families the security that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems everyone except the Prime Minister understands that returning to the old Newstart rate is not good for people. It's not good for families, it's not good for small businesses and it is not good for jobs and the economy. The RBA, the Business Council and the Retailers Association, as well as community groups and economists, support an increase in the base rate of unemployment payments. An increase would be good for people, for households, for local jobs and for local economies, particularly in areas outside of big cities—for the outer suburbs and for regional and remote Australia—and it would lift people out of poverty. The old rate was so low it was stopping people from being able to afford the basics: to keep a roof over their head, to keep groceries on the table, to be able to provide a fair go for their kids. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should show some heart this Christmas. It should really think about the most vulnerable Australians, those individuals and families who find themselves in crisis this Christmas, because the decisions that the government makes now will have profound impacts on these people and their families. This legislation would have a severe impact not just on the financial security but also on the mental health and wellbeing of some of the most vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish where I started by calling on the government to make a permanent increase to unemployment payments, to give people peace of mind and security and the insurance they need to be able to have a fair go, to have a good quality of life, and for us to be able to come out of this recession as a fairer country. I think that's what all Australians want. This government, as I said, should show some heart this Christmas and reverse these cruel cuts.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020. Reducing the coronavirus supplement from $250 a fortnight to $150 a fortnight is the wrong thing to do, quite simply because people won't be able to live on it. It's that simple. In fact, the unemployed are already at rock bottom on the original coronavirus supplement amount of $250 a fortnight. How on earth are they going to live on $150 a fortnight? It's just not enough. Sure, at $150 a fortnight, it means the unemployed will be getting about $50 a day, and, sure, that's a darn sight better than $40 a day, but it's not enough. It's not enough to pay for your housing. It's not enough to pay for your food; your medical expenses; your transport; your clothing, so that you look good for a job interview; and your ICT, so you've got a phone and the internet to be able to even apply for jobs. It's just not enough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, it's way below the poverty line. Why do we even have a thing called the poverty line if we're going to ignore it? The poverty line is exactly that; it's the figure at which you are in abject poverty and you can't live a decent life. In fact, the poverty line is about $65 a day, so about $50 a day is way below the poverty line. So this decision by the government will be completely and utterly unacceptable, and it will be entirely out of step with the views of the community and welfare groups and business groups—all sorts of people, including former Prime Minister John Howard. He is well known to be on the record arguing against $40 a day, and I suspect he won't be all that impressed with $50 a day either, on a coronavirus supplement of $150 a fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make the point about how small an amount of money this is, I draw the attention of honourable members to a printout off the web just yesterday about rental prices in Hobart, because Hobart now is one of the most expensive places in Australia to rent a house. I'll just flick through some of these places to rent: an ordinary-looking house is $830 per week; another house with three bedrooms is $600 per week; a one-bedroom apartment in a high-rise—well, low-rise—is $300 per week; a three-bedroom house is $600 per week; a three-bedroom apartment is $800 a week; a slightly bigger house is $650 a week; a house is $850 a week; a room in a boarding house is $260 a week; another townhouse is $850 a week; a house is $725 a week; a two-bedroom cottage in Bathurst Street in Hobart is $495 a week; and another boarding house is $250 for a single room. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on, but I'm sure my colleagues understand the point I'm getting at: when you are on JobSeeker and your coronavirus supplement is only $150 per fortnight, or $75 a week, you can't afford to rent any of those places. Even the single room in a boarding house at $260 a week is unaffordable. All this poverty by design will ensure is that we will have more homeless, more couch surfers and more people living in a tin shed out in the backyard. We can do better than this. We can do so much better than this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that unemployment benefits are really just a stopgap of course, that they're just something for maybe a few months while someone goes and gets a job—in fact, it should be a bit tough so they're encouraged even more to go and get a job. But the fact is almost all the unemployed want a job and they are doing everything they can do to get a job. This urban myth in some quarters that they're all dole bludgers is a terrible misrepresentation of the fact. And when you've got a situation like we now have in my electorate, where over 10,000 people are relying on JobSeeker and there are 21 people on JobSeeker for each job, the fact is most of those people who are currently unemployed stand a very real risk of being long-term unemployed, so it's no good to just give them a stopgap. They need a living income, because they stand to be unemployed for many, many months, so they're going to have rent, a car to run, food, medical expenses, ICT, grooming expenses. Many of these people are not young, single people; many of these people are people with families to support. So the idea we can have a stopgap for unemployment benefits misses the point that we're going to have a lot of long-term unemployed—and we're always going to have a small number of people who are simply unemployable. Even if you are lucky enough to get a job in only a few months, you've still got the sorts of rents that I referred to before and you're probably still paying $300, $400 or $500 a week in rent, on your mortgage payments or whatever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suggest we need a whole new approach to so-called welfare payments in this country, because, if we can bring ourselves to accept that people have expenses and they need to pay those expenses, then surely we can accept that everyone in the country whether you are unemployed or you are disabled or you are a carer or you are aged should get enough in income support from our government so that they can live and live a dignified life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I frankly don't even understand why Newstart or JobSeeker is at a different rate to, say, the age pension or the disability pension or carers payments or other payments. Surely they should all be the same amount. I think this global pandemic gives the government, and the opposition, an opportunity for a fresh look at the way we pay welfare in this country—or income support would be a better way to term it—and say, 'Okay, we've evolved for all sorts of reasons, some of them lost in history to where we are now, but it's time to have a root-and-branch review of the way we provide income support and to be prepared to redesign it from the ground up.' I'm very attracted to the idea of a living income for all Australians. So, no matter what your circumstances are, if you need income support from the federal government, you will get an amount of money that you can live on, and it will be consistent for all people who need income support. That's the view of ACOSS and others. Logically, that amount of money would be above the poverty line, because as soon as a government, maybe with the support of the opposition, agree that people should be paid an amount of money below the poverty line then you've got poverty by design. Surely we can do a lot better than having poverty by design in this country, but that's what you've got with the old Newstart rate. That's what we're probably barely avoiding with the old coronavirus supplement, but that's what you'll get with the new coronavirus supplement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is the government's intention—and I fear it is, come March or April—to get rid of the coronavirus supplement altogether and go back to $40 a day then I make the point again: it's poverty by design, which means we have a very cruel government. I'm delighted that the opposition is now talking in stronger terms about increasing unemployment benefits should they become the next government, but I do fear that the current government is ultimately heading for $40 a day, and that's a very, very cruel policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the ACOSS position is to have a living income, as I described; to make it in the order of $472 a week, which is basically the current age pension or disability pension; and then to acknowledge that different people have different extra needs, so there'll be supplements. Perhaps someone with a disability needs a particular supplement. Someone who's renting and paying the sort of rent I referred to earlier would continue to get Commonwealth rent assistance but hopefully at a realistic amount, because when you've got housing unaffordability like you have in many parts of Australia—especially in Hobart, which is the most unaffordable city, believe it or not, of all the capital cities in the country—we obviously need to look afresh at Commonwealth rent assistance. Can we afford this? Of course we can. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I apologise if I sound like a broken record, but I'm going to have to say this another thousand times, I reckon, before honourable members start to listen to me and pay attention. The fact that we are such a rich country means there is no reason in the world to have poverty by design, unless you're a cruel government. I remind honourable members of the figures. In Australia, our median wealth per adult is No. 1 in the world. We are the richest people in the world, out of about 200 countries, as measured by median wealth per adult—richer than even the Swiss. When we look at our average wealth per adult, we're No. 2 to the Swiss. These are mind-boggling figures. We're the 14th biggest economy as measured by GDP. We are a fabulously wealthy, fortunate and lucky country, I would add, with our resources, our social capital and all our other advantages. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose it's all about priorities. What do we think is important? I propose that what's important is for a government to look after the most disadvantaged members of our community and to look after them as well as we humanly can. Surely, by that standard, we can't tolerate a coronavirus supplement of $150 a fortnight, resulting in a gross amount of about $50 a day, which is $15 a day below the poverty line. It's poverty by design. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I close, I'd like to take this opportunity to give a plug to JobKeeper. I know we're here talking about JobSeeker, but I do want to make the point again to the government that the job isn't done here with JobKeeper. It was always fundamentally flawed because of the exclusions to eligibility, and it's not too late for the government to look afresh at this and to provide JobKeeper assistance, for example, to local government, to the tertiary sector and to other sectors that currently miss out. It would also give the community more certainty about the future of JobKeeper. We're going a few months at a time here, but that's no good to one business in my electorate that provides conference and event management. They've got no bookings for the rest of this year. They've got five events booked for September 2021 and more for 2022 and 2023, but are they going to last that long? They've got 17 staff at the moment on JobKeeper, but there's a real risk that they will fold and Hobart will lose a wonderful company and that expertise because JobKeeper won't be there for as long as it is required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The international travel sector: I know the government's announced a little bit of assistance for international travel agents recently, but it's not enough. Remember that travel agents make most of their money from international bookings; they make almost nothing from domestic bookings. So that's another sector that's going to need not only long-term support but some certainty now to encourage them and to allow them to keep those businesses afloat for as long as is needed, because some of these businesses aren't going to get any sort of decent income for another 12 months. We know that now, so why can't we say to them that we will continue JobKeeper in particular sectors for as long as is needed? I'm thinking of constituents who own a number of travel agencies. They could go to bed at night knowing, 'Okay, we won't fold the business. We'll keep it afloat a bit longer, because we'll have a bit of support for a bit longer.' They'd be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel—maybe the end of next year—when they can resume some sort of normal operations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, back to JobSeeker, I don't agree with reducing the coronavirus supplement to $150 a week. Frankly, it's at rock bottom already at $250 a week and that actually puts it roughly equivalent to, or a little bit less than, the age pension and the disability pension. However, it puts it roughly around the poverty line and it roughly achieves that alternative model, which I've spoken about, which is a living income for all people who rely on federal government income support. We should keep the $250, and the government should say they're going to keep the $250 and stop teasing people with three months here, three months there. No wonder a lot of us think the next three months at $150 will be the last three months and we're going to go back to $40 a day. We're going to go back to poverty by design and to betraying the most disadvantaged members of the community. We're going to go back to ignoring the fact that we're one of the richest countries in the world and we can afford to do so much better.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>): I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020 and in favour of the amendments moved by the member for Barton, and there are a couple of key reasons why. These amendments seek to ensure that the government does not cut the coronavirus supplement by Christmas. They also seek to deliver a permanent increase to the base rate of JobSeeker so we do not see people who looking for work living in poverty on $40 a day. These amendments also seek to retain the ongoing powers to keep paying the coronavirus supplement after 31 March 2021 and to retain those powers to make other beneficial changes to the taper rates, income tests and eligibility criteria after 31 March. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are critical and necessary. Firstly, I wish to highlight that we are not yet through the pandemic. Until we have a vaccination and the world is immunised, we will still face the risk of our community and our economy periodically having to shut down to try and keep people safe. We are quite lucky and have worked hard in Victoria to get through our second wave, and we are now in a COVID-safe environment. We have worked hard as a community and as a society not only to ensure the health of individuals but so we can start to work together to open businesses and the economy. It is only because we have worked together that we're able to do that. However, cutting back the support, as the government proposes to do by Christmas, will hurt that recovery. It will hurt that recovery because businesses that rely upon customers getting the higher rate will soon see those customers disappear, making the recovery longer than it needs to be and putting thousands of local jobs at risk. It will also make it very hard for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have seen recently, with other clusters and outbreaks in South Australia and Sydney, this hasn't just happened in Victoria. Whilst we still have Australians returning from overseas who could quite possibly be infected with coronavirus, we are at risk. That is why it is too soon for this government to be withdrawing support. We are still at risk of second, third and fourth waves just like we are seeing in countries all over the world. It is premature for this government to be winding back support because we don't know when the next outbreak will be. We are prepared for, and we are doing all we can to stop, a second, third or fourth wave, and that is why the government is ill-advised to be cutting back support now. It's also the time—right before Christmas—at which they're cutting back support. I've been talking to so many people in the welfare agencies in my community, and what they are telling me is that this year they're seeing less people and the regulars aren't seeking as much support. The extra support that people have received from the coronavirus supplement has meant that they have been able to put a little bit away for Christmas. There are less people asking for toys from Uniting this year, but there are new families asking for toys—people who did not get access to appropriate support through JobSeeker because of partner income or who did not get access to JobKeeper and have now lost their jobs. Again, this is an area where the government is letting down the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part that is so critical to this amendment is calling for a permanent increase to the base rate of JobSeeker. I cannot believe that the government is putting forward the real proposition in these bills that, come March 2021, everyone on JobSeeker will drop back to $40 a day. Yes, it was a temporary measure that they introduced, but what we have seen through the introduction of this temporary measure is how vital this extra support is. It actually lifts people up out of poverty. It allows people to have dignity, the security of a roof over their head, food on their table and the opportunity to look for work if there are jobs available. I also point out to the government another reason why we need to lift the base rate and lock it in on an ongoing basis. Our jobs market has not returned to what it was prior to the pandemic. They may gloat about figures and national headline figures, but the lived experience on the ground is very different. Yes, there are lots of hospitality jobs—insecure, part-time, flexible jobs for people who can work nights and weekends. These jobs are not suitable for a single mum who may not have appropriate care arrangements, and they are not suitable for older workers who may have worked for their entire lives in another industry and don't have the required skills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got to make sure that any support in JobSeeker is linked to a proper training program. I note that, very few of the jobs advertised are entry level jobs, and all of them are seeking highly skilled workers. If you're working in an industry that has been shut down, like the arts, entertainment and events sector, it's hard for you to transition into a hospitality role, like a chef or a barista, without appropriate training. You will need access to a decent rate of JobSeeker whilst you undertake that training. That is where the government is not thinking holistically about how we can help people who may want to transition into other industries. You need a decent JobSeeker payment whilst you are retraining for the other jobs they may exist. This is what the government isn't doing. They are running their entire policy based upon short-term economic outcomes and their own budget, not on long-term job security, economic security or building long-term resilience into our local communities and economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight some of the lived experiences of people in my electorate, what they have gone through in the recent months and what it would mean to them if these cuts went through, particularly if they went back to $40 a day as the government is proposing. First of all, there's a fabulous volunteer at Eaglehawk Community House. She is one of the people the government are attacking when they cut these payments. She worked tirelessly through the period of lockdowns and restrictions in Victoria. The Eaglehawk Community House made over 15,000 meals, and she was responsible for cooking all of them. On JobSeeker, not quite old enough yet to retire and struggling to find work with the skill set she has, she volunteers at the Eaglehawk Community House. When the pandemic hit and we faced restrictions and we had some little clusters break out in Bendigo, she cooked meals. She cooked 15,000 meals to help our community and did it with the support of JobSeeker, yes, but as a volunteer for Eaglehawk Community House. This is who the government are attacking when they cut these payments, someone who has volunteered so much of her own time to help our community, particularly the most vulnerable, when things were tough, when people were living at home and in isolation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also Peter, who spoke to my office and to me about how the extra payments meant he could buy some warmer clothes this winter, some shoes that fitted and some extra food. It even meant that he could fill up his car without feeling guilty. He didn't have to plan where he was going based on the petrol that he had. He said that it might not seem like much to most, but to him it was a lifeline. As someone who had worked hard their whole life until he experienced some health issues, finding himself unemployed and needing support from the government was already hard, but then to live in poverty on the old Newstart rate was absolutely heartbreaking. He was grateful for the increase because he was able to purchase things he wouldn't have been able to. It's also improved his mental health because he isn't sitting at home stressing about money. JobSeeker should be more like the pension. It should help secure people, particularly those who've worked hard their whole lives and only at the very end are finding themselves in a situation where they can no longer work because of ill-health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also Melissa, a single mum in her 30s receiving the parenting payment single. Currently, it has allowed her to put some extra money into her utilities and mortgage. It's a bit of a financial buffer. She is not wasting it, as some in the government are suggesting, but getting ahead. One of the main reasons she said that she was always sceptical of this government was that she didn't believe it would continue, so she got ahead in her bills and in her mortgage. She at least is looking forward to this Christmas, because it is the first time she will not have to turn to family for extra money, but she does worry about what will happen next year when this government winds back the support. Melissa is concerned because she has a six-year-old and is not currently receiving child support. That's another battle. She said that the extra buffer means that she is able to get ahead in her bills, as I've said, and put a bit of money aside for the car and house insurance. That way she is able not to stress about money this Christmas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is Sharon, who's an older woman who was facing homelessness. Just before the rise she had been couch surfing. Having run out of options of staying with friends, she was booked in to stay at the Castlemaine caravan park to pitch a tent with all of her worldly possessions during the middle of winter. Then the rate increase came in, and it meant that she could afford a bond, that she could afford to rent. She is now doing work, now that she has secured accommodation. She has had some work as a COVID patient screener and is working with her employment agency on further work opportunities. She is keen to work and willing to give anything a go that she has the skills for. She's got confidence and optimism now. People like Sharon are the very people we want to see helped, and with a decent rate of JobSeeker they can get the help. It's about allowing people and families to secure the basics—a home, food security and transport security—so that they've got the confidence to go out and apply for the jobs. It means that they can do the extra training required to get the jobs that exist. That seems like common sense to me, but the bill that we have before us isn't common sense. The bill before us would cut support way too soon, impacting businesses in so many local areas and impacting individuals. I strongly urge the government to consider the amendments put forward by Labor. This is an opportunity to rewrite a wrong. If you really want to see our country rebound stronger and more secure post this pandemic and this recession, invest in those in our community who are doing it the toughest: the people who were unemployed before the pandemic and the people who have become unemployed during the pandemic. Right now they're the people who will secure our long-term recovery. If they've got a decent rate of income support, they will have the means to afford their rent, food, transport and the extra costs that may come with retraining for the jobs that are available. As I've stated, it will also help to secure the thousands of local jobs and small businesses in our community relying on these people to have a higher rate of support. It just makes economic and social sense to have a decent rate of JobSeeker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want this country or these individuals to go back to the old rate of Newstart which destined people to poverty and created an underclass of Australians who were struggling. It became a mindset of trying to survive day to day: 'Can I afford my rent? Which bill will I pay this month? Which bill will I get extended?' It pushed people into poverty who didn't need to be there. It was poverty by design by a government that was determined to be cruel. And this suggestion by some industry and some employers that a higher rate of JobSeeker keeps people from applying for jobs is nonsense. Those employers who are looking for workers should look at the jobs that they're offering. They should look at the training that they're offering. They should look at the job agencies and at whether the job agencies are sending them the appropriate people. If you've got a job that's not filled during this pandemic and this recession, we need to look at the employment industry and employment services. Simply cutting JobSeeker will not find you the workers that you need—another point that this government misses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very, very simple rhetoric and very, very lazy rhetoric to suggest that a lower rate of JobSeeker will force people into the jobs that are available. On behalf of the 10,000 or so people in my community who are currently receiving the supplement, I again urge the government to give them a happy Christmas and a new year where they can feel safe and secure going forward. I urge the government to keep the higher rate of the coronavirus supplement, lock in an ongoing JobSeeker rate that is livable and that gives people the dignity, respect and the means to look for work. I urge the government to retain the ongoing powers to make sure that we have fair income tests, fair eligibility criteria and tapering rates that are fair and that ensure that more people have the means to look for good work and can secure their futures and their children's futures.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I am very pleased to speak after the member for Bendigo, and I echo many of the sentiments in her fine contribution to this debate on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Extension of Coronavirus Support) Bill 2020. As we have done before with so many pieces of legislation in this place, yet again it is up to the Labor Party to come and discuss these issues: why some of them are important, why some of them need to be changed, why some of them should be defended and why some of them should be stopped. Yet again, another piece of legislation comes to this House with hardly any government members—I don't think there were any other than the minister—willing to stand up and discuss their own policy. This isn't Labor Party policy. This is the government's policy, which, yet again, none of them want to get up and defend. None of them have the courage, the commitment or the passion for their own policy and their own legislation to get up in this place and bother to talk about it. This bill will affect literally hundreds of thousands of Australians who will return to $40 a day because of what this bill does, yet not one government member turns up and fronts the debate on this bill. This will be their legacy—coming to this place and tearing away support for those people and those Australians who have, throughout this pandemic, relied on government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This coronavirus support payment began because we faced a global pandemic. I remember the press conference that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer did outside the Prime Minister's office here in this building. They spoke about how there was going to be a wage subsidy for those businesses that had to close their doors, and they spoke about how those people who found themselves out of work as a result of this pandemic would receive an extra $550 a fortnight. Everyone who was out of work was going to be looked after. And then, bit by bit, they walked that back and started pulling away that level of support for Australians. Except one thing hasn't changed yet—this pandemic is not over. This pandemic is still with us. Yes, Australia has put itself in an enviable position when it comes to managing this virus, but the virus is still here. We've seen most recently in South Australia how quickly we can shut down and how quickly things can change. I sincerely hope that no other state in this country or, frankly, anywhere in the world has to deal with another outbreak. I hope that we see it out to a vaccine, an effective vaccine, before another outbreak. But, dare I say, there will be one. This pandemic isn't over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More to the point, the economic fallout and the economic consequences of this pandemic will be with us for years. The unemployment rate will take years to recover. I hope I'm wrong; I hope we have huge amounts of economic growth. But I'm not convinced yet that this pandemic is not going to take years for us to recover from. Yet we stand here with no government MPs willing to put their name, their voice, their time and their effort into defending this bill which will ultimately bring hundreds of thousands of Australians back down to $40 a day in March, striking them to the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that through no fault of their own Australians can find themselves out of work. It has happened to my family, it has happened to my friends and I'm sure every single member in this place can point to people they desperately care about who have done the right thing in this pandemic and shut down their businesses and stood down from their work in order to do the right thing by others in our society. What did we see at the start of the lockdowns in April? We saw hundreds of thousands of Australians, many for the very first time in their lives, accessing the JobSeeker payment, the support payment for unemployed Australians, because of this pandemic—through absolutely no fault of their own. In fact, because many of them were willing to do the right thing by others, they were sacrificing. And the businesses that they were involved in were sacrificing some of their operations because government restrictions, both federal and state, required those businesses to not operate in the way in which they usually would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what did we see from this government? What did we see from the Minister for Government Services? I remember the queues around the block of thousands and thousands of Australians wanting to access the JobSeeker payment for the very first time. In order to do so they needed a CRN number, and in order to access a CRN number at that point in time you had to go into a Centrelink office. The government just sat there and the minister just sat there until the country and MPs on this side of the chamber were literally pleading with them to change the arrangements to access a new CRN, so that people didn't have to literally line up and gather when we were asking them not to line up and gather because of the pandemic that we were facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then finally the minister said—I remember it well—'We have changed the arrangements. You can now go onto the myGov website and leave your details, and a Centrelink operator will call you back.' That happened a couple of days later after days and days of the queues. And then what happened? The myGov website crashed, and what was the response from the minister? It was that it had been hacked. Except it hadn't been hacked; that was just something that the minister decided to say without any facts or any evidence to support it. Then, when that was pointed out to this minister, what was his response? His response was, 'Oh, my bad.' 'My bad,' says the minister. I'll give him credit: it was one of the first times anyone on that side of the House said 'my bad' and owned up to a mistake in government.</span>

                    </a>  Not this week, the member for Lalor rightly points out. But it shows the attitude and it shows the views of those opposite toward Australians who through no fault of their own found themselves out of work and found themselves in need of government support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coronavirus supplement during this pandemic has helped thousands and thousands of Australians. It has. It has been a great thing. For many people this was the first time in their lives where they weren't worried about whether or not they could buy food. They weren't worried about whether or not they could cover some of their rent. The thousands and thousands of Australians who through no fault of their own found themselves out of work were able to have some level of confidence and some level of support to be able to get through whatever this pandemic was throwing at Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then the government began the process that has led us here to today. They started crawling back and cutting the support. Except this pandemic is not over. This pandemic is still with us, and the government is cutting the pandemic support. In Victoria during stage 4 lockdown, we couldn't even have family over for dinner. Childcare services were only available for permitted workers. They were some of the hardest days in Victoria that I can remember, but Victorians pulled together. Victorians did the right thing. Victorians supported each other and achieved something truly remarkable. Instead of that—instead of supporting Victorians during our hour of need—the government pulled JobKeeper and JobSeeker support, and now they're doing it again, and this pandemic isn't over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We face again a government that started this pandemic with an acknowledgement that, yes, we needed to support people to help Australia get through this pandemic, and now that all seems to be out the window. There were even some of us wondering if maybe the Prime Minister wasn't the ideological zealot we once thought he was. Maybe he had some understanding of what Australians are going through. But his instincts are clearly riding to the surface again, and he is clearly leading a government that is returning to the old Liberal way of pulling support away from Australians, of removing government assistance for people during hard times, making people go through unnecessary hardship and allowing Australians in this country to return to poverty. That is the legacy of this bill, that is the legacy of this government and that is the legacy of those MPs over there, none of whom are willing to stand up and put their name to the speaking roster on this bill. None of them are willing to stand up and say, 'Yes, I support making Australians only live on $40 a day.' Effectively, that is what this bill does, and it's not surprising that none of you are willing to put your name to it. This pandemic isn't over. This pandemic is still going to be with us for months ahead, and you on that side of the House are consigning Australians to living in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House understand the effect of this bill. We understand how important it is, and that's why we're standing up and saying, 'Don't do it.' You should be extending the payments and you should be making sure that Australians are not consigned to poverty. It is not too high a goal to aim for. It is not too much to ask. If you're not going to do that then at least stand up and tell us why.</span>

The land handover ceremony was to the traditional owners of Wampaya country north-east of Tennant Creek. They received title to six square kilometres—understand this: six square kilometres!—of land on the Anthony Lagoon pastoral lease, which, combined with Eva Downs, it's neighbour who they work with, is 9,346 square kilometres. This handback was made to representatives of the Gagaguwaja Aboriginal Land Trust and was made by the Hon. Ken Wyatt. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The grant was the result of a settlement deed between the Northern Land Council; the Northern Territory of Australia; and the Australian Agricultural Company, AACo, to finalise Anthony Lagoon land claim No. 74, which included the land swap arrangement with pastoral interests. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That land claim was lodged in 1983. The proponents of that land claim have mostly passed away. This final grant, made after so many years, was as a result of the very hard work and dedication from people from the Northern Land Council representing the traditional owners, and they are to be congratulated. It's just so sad that it took so long, and it's so sad that it's such a small pocket of land.</span>

Any brand new section of our national highway that we're building needs to be built to the highest possible standard. But the Queensland government and its members for Maryborough, Hervey Bay and Bundaberg, on whom motorists rely on this stretch to travel to Brisbane, must explain why they support two lanes for a Tiaro bypass that fails on safety, fails the economic needs of the region and fails their motorists. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon, there will be a minimum of four lanes from Melbourne to Sydney to Brisbane and to Curra, just north of Gympie. At Curra, the four-lane national highway will end. This is unacceptable. The state government must bring forward plans for a four-lane highway between Curra and Maryborough, beginning with the Tiaro bypass. If this section of highway was in New South Wales or Victoria, there'd already be four lanes. Premier Palaszczuk's members of parliament in Wide Bay must insist on four lanes for the Tiaro bypass and four lanes between Curra and Maryborough. Denis Chapman's petition, which I present, calls on us to reject Queensland's two-lane bypass proposal.</span>

All went to work and never came home. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a rapidly growing industry, employing an increasing number of workers. What we are seeing is Third World standards of work in a First World country. Five deaths in as many weeks is shocking and unacceptable. Yesterday, I met with a food delivery worker named Ashley who told me about the pressures that the workers and riders are put under, directly by the way that the app and its algorithm operate to deliver food as quickly as possible. As a result of that pressure, we end up with a situation where riders are riding in an unsafe way—skipping give way signs, running red lights, riding on the footpaths, going between parked cars and the lanes, risking being doored as someone opens the door to their car and then falling under other traffic. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pressure is directly related to the way they are paid. It's a national issue, and so far there has been no federal government action to deal with it. We need to move beyond whether they are employees or not and acknowledge that they are workers and that they are not being treated safely, and we need to act.</span>

There was a time for an abundance of caution, but now it's time for evidence to rule supreme again. I refer to the seating arrangements in this chamber, which bear no resemblance to the ARL and NRL grand finals, with people shoehorned together for hours. It's time to follow the evidence and let Australians get back to work, to do Work for the Dole and to renew household final consumption as it should be renewed. We got the cases in the first wave in Queensland under control on 20 April. Why are we still here now? The nearest fragment of this delicate RNA virus is in a sewerage system or somewhere on the other side of the Timor Sea. It's time for those quivering medical specialists doing Zoom from home to get out from under the doona and start getting back to work, forward facing, serving Australia and working again. The millions of Australians without work, including the 8,000 on Newstart in my electorate, deserve a shot. We need to start in here. Get out from under the doona. Get out from under the cot and give it a crack. Let's give it a go, get back to work and come back in 2021 with the virus behind us. Stop the virtue signalling. We can't even go to Christmas carols at a school. We can't even go to a child's graduation. The virtue signalling in the education departments around this country is a disgrace, and it's time they contacted their own CHOs and got written advice. It's time to get back to work. It's time to open our schools again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I take this opportunity to table two speeches by my friend and colleague the member for Fowler, Chris Hayes. Chris was unable to finish this speech on the anniversary of the National Apology to Victims and Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse. I think members are aware that, in the process of delivering this speech on that day, Chris was taken ill, and he is shortly to undergo surgery. All of our very best wishes are with him. In this speech, Chris was going to read the words of his cousin Anthony Hayes, who says, 'Words without action are empty.' Anthony talks about the betrayal of trust that he suffered as a child and the way that he has had his trust betrayed throughout his life. It's a very powerful and moving speech. So I table this first speech.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second speech that I'll be tabling is this speech that Chris intended to deliver on International Human Rights Day, the theme of which is the right to life. Chris speaks once again about his very strong commitment to ending the death penalty wherever it occurs and whoever is subject to it. The speech talks about the importance of abolishing the death penalty and making sure that effective legal representation is available to anyone who is facing the death penalty. It's a great honour for me to present these speeches on Chris's behalf and wish him all the very best with his surgery.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I recently had the great pleasure of joining the Rotary Club of Gosford City for their men's health breakfast to raise funds in support of prostate cancer research. The special guest speaker at this event was the Hon. Jim Lloyd, a former member for Robertson and minister in the Howard government, who now serves as the national support group executive for the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia. Jim really spoke from the heart. He shared his personal journey with cancer and shared the importance of testing to ensure early detection and treatment. As many of my colleagues would know, Jim is quite pivotal in his support of the Big Aussie Barbie in Parliament House in September every year. He's been a fierce advocate for the specialist nursing program which assists regional hospitals in employing more prostate cancer nurses. Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death among men, taking too many of our brothers, fathers, grandfathers and other loved ones far too soon. The Prostate Cancer Foundation recommends that men at the average risk of developing the cancer undergo PSA testing every two years from ages 50 to 69 and that men with a family history be tested every two years, usually from age 40. I want to thank Jim for his tireless advocacy in this space and also to thank David Bacon, the President of the Rotary Club of Gosford City, who was another tremendous advocate and helped coordinate the breakfast. I thank him for his dedicated volunteering for so many important groups on the Central Coast and his recognition of this incredibly important issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  On Wednesday 18 November, I was delighted to join Toukley Neighbourhood Centre for a morning tea to celebrate the unveiling of their new community mural, painted by artist Colin Miller. The mural is Colin's gift to the Toukley Neighbourhood Centre for their big hearts and generous support. As Colin put it: 'After receiving some unexpected help from the Toukley Neighbourhood Centre, I kept thinking about their big blank wall. I was pleased when they approved my offer to paint something for them for free.' Colin dedicated six months to this project, painstakingly capturing locals chosen by the students of Toukley Public School as pillars of their community: Uncle Gavi Duncan; Matt Sonter, the Indigenous community development manager from Central Coast Council; Kara Walker, the Aboriginal education officer from Kooloora preschool; Mrs Beckman, a favourite teacher; Annette Starr, a retired TPS community liaison officer; Michael Stoke, also known to the kids as 'the hamburger man', from Nachaels at East Toukley; Shaun McKinney from the Toukley Hawks; and social worker Bonnie Merz. Colin modelled the mural on an original Australian $1 note and said he's hidden 38 animals in the mural for children to find with their sharp little eyes. Colin has also beautifully painted our local flora and the spectacular Norah Head Lighthouse. He hopes his mural, 'simple from a distance, yet complex and interesting up close, will bring joy and happiness to people for years to come'. And, as with all of his work, he said that he couldn't have tried any harder. I would like to thank Colin for his generous gift of this mural to our community and join with Colin in recognising the Toukley Neighbourhood Centre and its volunteers for the work they do for others.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  On Saturday 14 November, Indian-Australians celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, an important spiritual and cultural milestone of the community. Diwali teaches that light overcomes darkness and knowledge overcomes ignorance. In a difficult year when we have been overcome by the coronavirus pandemic, this important message of hope reminds us that we will overcome the challenges we are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the largest growing migrant groups in my electorate of Reid is our Indian Australian community. We are home to the Sri Karphaga Vinayakar Temple in Homebush West, a vibrant hub of the Hindu community in our area. I trust it was a special celebration, despite having to practice COVID-safe restrictions. Reid's Indian Australian community have gone above and beyond to show compassion and care for those doing it tough this year due to the virus. Whether it be the temple devotees or volunteers from the Hindu Council of Australia in Homebush, I have seen incredible displays of charity. They have made sure people have food and care packages and have even offered temporary accommodation for those in need. This beautiful hospitality and community spirit reminds us once again of the message of Diwali—that light always triumphs over darkness.</span>

The October election in Aotearoa saw the resounding return of a compassionate, progressive government and an increase in the Greens vote.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same night, the ACT Greens tripled their representation with six MLAs, including three ministers, returning them to government. With Greens in shared government, the ACT has gone 100 per cent renewable, built new public transport solutions and is making this city even more livable. When the public sees Greens in parliament in government, they like it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent Queensland election, the Greens, again, increased our representation with huge swings in seats across Brisbane. In Victoria, a record 36 Greens councillors were just elected to local governments, including the first Greens majority council in Yarra. And now, with Joe Biden setting more ambitious climate goals for the US, there's a genuine chance that the global tide can turn. The people are speaking and their voices are growing stronger. A vote for the Greens has power. Your vote will help kick the Liberals out and help us push the Labor and Liberal parties further and faster on the climate crisis and tackling economic inequality. The green wave is coming, and it is powerful.</span>

I now hope that you have enjoyed your formals and your graduations. My eldest son, Byron, joined me in parliament this week, now that he's finished his HSC, and I couldn't be prouder of his achievements and the students in our community who completed year 12. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The class of 2020 have overcome uncertainty and challenges. The HSC can be stressful enough without making the transition to online classes; being kept apart from family and friends due to social distancing and border closures; and having formals and celebrations, which are a source of anticipation and reward for all the hard work throughout the year, under constant risk of being postponed or cancelled. But, like so many people in our community, our year 12s persevered and they kept going. No matter what their results were, I'd like to say to year 12s that you should be so proud of yourselves for everything you have achieved this year. I tell my son this and I tell other year 12s this: it doesn't matter what you do next—you can always change it—but look forward to your futures. Your futures are so bright, and I hope that you now have a safe and happy break with your family and friends. Whether you work, study or decide to travel when you can, I wish you all the very best for your future. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  When I was elected to this place, I thought that members were here to make life easier for future generations, but not members of this government. They've climbed into the castle and now they want to pull the drawbridge up behind them. They clearly want to be a government that leaves things worse than it found them. This government, whose members got access to free higher education, now wants to make massive increases to the cost of university degrees. They've cut TAFE by $3 billion. It was fine for them to study for free, but they think young Australians should enter a tough job market, in the middle of a recession, with massive debts. Then there's superannuation. They're happy to claim 15 per cent superannuation, but they want to take superannuation increases away from ordinary Australian workers and stop the legislated increase to 12 per cent. Then there's their jobseeker—the jobseeker who gets a $4,000-an-hour jet to fly around Europe. Meanwhile, the rest of the jobseekers around the country are going to be living on $40 a day. I could go on. This is a generation of MPs who took advantage of an easier housing market, and they've got no plan to tackle housing affordability. They rose through the ranks of a secure labour market with strong wage growth, and now they're happy with stagnant wage growth. They've made it, and now they want to pull the drawbridge up behind them. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  This year has not been without its challenges for everyone in the community. Many have lost their jobs and some their livelihoods, while others have been separated from loved ones. In the face of these challenges, I'm incredibly proud of how our community has come together to support one another. That's why the federal government has launched the Go Local First campaign, encouraging Australians to go local first when purchasing goods and services, to help small and family businesses get back on their feet. Now more than ever, Australian small businesses need local communities to back them and support their recovery. These are the businesses that support our community organisations and sporting clubs, provide jobs for locals and ensure our regions have the services we rely on. Over Christmas, when you're buying your presents for loved ones or sourcing food for the family table, make sure to buy from local small and family businesses. By choosing local businesses, you're keeping money in your local community, helping the local economy and supporting local jobs. My ask is simple: I encourage everyone in my electorate of Barker and on the greater Australian continent to actively support this campaign—to do whatever they can to help our fantastic small and family businesses to get back on their feet—by going local first.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Right now, there are posties riding around my electorate trying to deliver two full postal runs in a single day. This is the alternative model that Australia Post has imposed. Leigh has contacted me with her increasing concerns about her partner's experience and that of his colleagues as local posties. Leigh says they're effectively delivering twice the amount of mail they were delivering before the change. This doubled workload is placing enormous strain on both the physical and the emotional wellbeing of posties, as they struggle to do their best to get through each day, before going home exhausted. She tells me that, even with delivery vans operating alongside them each day and on each run, they're often working from 6.30 in the morning until five at night and still not able to complete the delivery of all the day's mail.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leigh says the media reports that posties are 'loving the new system' is, in her observation, simply not true. All the stories she hears are about posties who are struggling to cope. As she says, 'They might love the job, but they certainly do not love the new delivery model, and they fear for their future. Some have even taken early retirement.' She fears that no-one in Australia Post or the Morrison government is listening to them and that it will contribute to serious mental health problems, physical injury or even death. They need to be heard.</span>

But we are interested in hosting the Games in 2032 not just because of two weeks of a sporting spectacular but because it offers two decades of benefits and opportunities—a decade in the lead-up to the games and a decade after. This is about an opportunity for health and education. This is about sports diplomacy. This is about ensuring that we accelerate the delivery of infrastructure. This is about a tourism boost that we would never have seen before. Now, we take nothing for granted, but we're in it and we're going to go for it, and, please God, we'll get it.</span>

I sat in this chamber last night listening to those opposite say that this government had left no-one behind in this pandemic. There was laughter. I tell you what, there was no laughter when you counted the people they have left behind: casual workers, university workers, Kiwis living in this country and paying tax for years, local government workers, aviation workers and workers at dnata. They've left behind pensioners—left them out of indexation. They cut JobKeeper for childcare workers in Victoria in the middle of a lockdown. The government left a lot of Australians behind, but, shamelessly, they come into this place and claim they haven't. They let Victorians down time and time again. The chief credit-taker stood in this chamber suggesting that everything that happened in Victoria was someone else's fault, as if it wasn't the responsibility of a pandemic.</span>

They're going to lock students in my electorate out of a tertiary education, in a recession, by outpricing them—by making the fees so high that the young people that I represent won't make that choice because they won't be able to afford it. And they're locking out current workers. Every worker in the country is at risk if they can be replaced by someone younger and eligible— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I recently had the honour of attending an event that was really a red-letter day for our Cairns Men's Shed. I can now proudly say the funding has been delivered, the contract is well and truly signed and the shed is now owned by its members. Cairns Men's Shed has come a long way, in leaps and bounds, for the past few years and is widely regarded as one of the best sheds in our region. In fact, it's the only shed in Australia where the members fully own the land on which and the building in which they operate. I can honestly say that it makes me immensely proud to have played a role in delivering this outcome for such an amazing community organisation. </span>

I'd also like to acknowledge past presidents Clive Lee and John King, as well as the many local businesses who donated their services to achieve this amazing outcome for members of the community. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Bob's wife, Beth Lavington, who worked tirelessly behind the scenes, making sense of the layers of bureaucracy and ensuring that all the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To everyone involved in the men's shed, I'd like to say: job very, very well done. Now I have to say to you that, with these things, one job finishes and another's ready to start. I think it's about time we started to look at the car park!</span>

Eight thousand of those are considered vulnerable—Australians crashing on couches and people who need medical care and have spent thousands of dollars on cancelled flights. Many from my electorate of Wills are stuck overseas. I'll give you just two examples. Ludmilla is stuck in Moscow, struggling to get by, separated from her loved ones and in a vulnerable financial situation. Her flights have been cancelled twice because of Australian caps. Brendan is stuck in Cape Town. He wants to return home to his job so he can just pay back the enormous, crippling debt that he's got due to being stuck overseas. Those are just two out of 37,000 stories.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But where is the Prime Minister? In September, he promised to get all stranded Australians home by Christmas. Well, Prime Minister, there are 23 days until Christmas. You've still got an opportunity. But what have you been doing? You've been blaming others. You've been passing the buck, blaming states and territories for their lack of quarantine capacity. Prime Minister, if there was ever a time to demonstrate leadership, it's now. It's not hard, and you know that, if you wanted to do it, you would. You'd get your ministers together, you'd make a plan, you'd actually create federal quarantine spots, you'd organise the flights and you would bring our stranded Aussies home.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  A very special Australian Community Relief Edition of the popular board game Monopoly has just been released. The edition highlights regional towns with an outstanding sense of community spirit. It's no surprise that two of the three Tasmanian properties on the board are in the electorate of Braddon, and I think the ratio is about right. The city of Devonport is on the board at 300 bucks—significantly undervalued! For the astute player: buy now, buy early, because, once the new federally funded waterfront precinct is complete, your investment's going to skyrocket. At $320, the picturesque harbourside village of Strahan is also on the board. For your investment, you are located on the edge of the west coast wilderness area, where you can cruise the Gordon River, ride the wilderness railway and feast on Tasmania's best produce. I encourage everyone to buy the game this year, with $5 from every sale donated kindly to the Red Cross.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if board games aren't your thing, why not book a holiday to visit the north-west, the west coast or King island in the great state of Tasmania? The region is back and open for business, and we're rolling out the welcome mat. Who knows? It might be your only overseas trip this year. You couldn't find a better place to spend your summer holidays. We look forward to seeing you once again in the great state of Tasmania.</span>

On Monday, Qantas confirmed it has sacked 2,000 ramp and baggage staff throughout the country and will replace them with workers from a foreign corporation on lower wages and conditions. It's corporate immorality at its worst. But what the Morrison government is allowing Qantas to do is to pocket $800 million worth of JobKeeper subsidies and avoid the payment of airport levies and fees so they can use the pandemic as an excuse to sack their loyal Australian workforce and bring in workers from a foreign corporation on lower wages and conditions. It's a disgrace, and the Morrison government is saying nothing. So much for standing up for Australian workers!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The JobKeeper subsidy was put in place by this parliament to protect Australian workers' jobs, not allow businesses to use the cover of the pandemic to sack their workforce. Australian companies should not be allowed to abuse JobKeeper so that they can fulfil their goals of cutting workers' wages and conditions and attacking unions, and that's exactly what Qantas have done. They just celebrated their centenary. Many of you on that side were there for the clinking of the champagne glasses and for the photo ops. How about you stand up for those Qantas workers who have lost their jobs? How about you stand up for Australian workers for once?</span>

We stand in this parliament 5½ years later, and we have found that community. It's called Kimba. We have been through three Senate inquiries and two court cases, and, in Kimba, we've had a survey and two full plebiscites, the last one showing 61.58 per cent support for this facility with a 90 per cent turnout. I've had a delegation in this parliament in the last two days, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister Brendan O'Connor for their audience. But I am absolutely perplexed that the Labor Party have walked with us through the last five years in that selection process and now stand instructing their senators to vote against it. If the ALP instruct their senators to vote against it, they do, even though many of them disagree. This community has gone down the path and ticked all the boxes under the instruction of the—</span>

That result in today's national accounts for the September quarter has seen a 3.3 per cent increase, the single largest quarterly increase in GDP since 1976. These national accounts numbers have been driven by households. Household consumption is up by 7.9 per cent after falling by 12.5 per cent in the June quarter.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, we know that the national economic recovery is underway. One of the key indicators of that is the number of people who are finding a job. Last month 178,000 jobs were created. We have seen the effective unemployment rate, which takes into account those who have lost their job or seen their working hours reduced to zero, fall from a peak of 14.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent today. We've seen the participation rate increase to 65.8 per cent, near the level it was at the start of the pandemic. We have seen very strong labour market growth, even stronger than expected. The Australian economy is showing remarkable resilience. This is due to the achievements and sacrifices of millions of Australians across the country. These results—this better performance and these economic indicators—are a sign of their hard work, and the results belong to them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:06</span>):  [by video link] I thank the member for Bennelong for his question. I thank him and, through him, I thank all his constituents and Australians all around the country, as the Treasurer has just done, for their magnificent efforts over many months now during the pandemic. That has been the key ingredient of the comeback that is now certainly underway from the COVID-19 recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for Bennelong joins all government members in looking forward to Garth Hamilton, the newly-elected member for Groom, joining us soon. We congratulate him on his election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That comeback is underway. That comeback is built on the strong public health response that has been put in place all around the country. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has said quite plainly that we have turned the corner. He has said that the recovery is underway. Indeed, the national account figures released today confirm the accuracy of what the Governor of the Reserve Bank has said and the Treasurer has already referred to—3.3 per cent growth in this September quarter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we and I'm sure all Australians welcome the news that the technically defined recession has concluded, we and all Australians know that we still have a very long way to go. There are still Australians that we need to get back into jobs. There are still Australian businesses that remain heavily impacted by COVID-19 and the restrictions, particularly the international travel restrictions, that are in place. The government continue to support and respond to those issues—whether it is the travel agents, which just this week we have announced particular measures for—because we understand and adapt. We're continuing to work with all Australians around the country so we can keep the comeback going and we can keep the recovery on its path. We're ensuring that Australians get back into jobs. We're continuing to save livelihoods and continuing to get Australians on the right track and where they want to be in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More Australians will get into jobs. That's what the OECD is saying. The economy will continue to grow. That's the optimistic outlook that has been upgraded for Australia. It is Australians who have responded to the strong measures that we as a government have put in place. They are the ones who've taken up those opportunities. They are the ones who, because of those supports, have been able to plan for their own future and for their own way of ensuring they come out of this COVID-19 recession and have more choices for them, their families and their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also been a demonstration of the wisdom of the measures in the budget. We're driving investment in the Australian economy through the many tax incentives and initiatives outlined by the Treasurer this year. That economic recovery plan is working. It's working for all Australians. It has set us on the right path. It has made us stand out globally. We will continue on that path and we will continue to stand by Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There is a long, hard and bumpy road ahead, but today's national accounts confirm that the economic recovery is underway, just as recent data in recent days has about house prices, consumer confidence and building sales.

Across his electorate there are around 60,000 constituents who are benefiting from the tax relief that was in this year's budget and legislated through the parliament. Around 20,000 pensioners and others on income support in the electorate of Canning have benefited from the two $750 payments that have already made their way to the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's national accounts confirm that the economic recovery is underway. This is the economic recovery that Australians have worked very hard for in the face of a once-in-a-century pandemic and in the face of the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression. Quarterly GDP growth was up in the September quarter by 3.3 per cent, the single largest increase since 1976, and this followed a fall of seven per cent in the June quarter. While technically the recession may be over, Australia's economic recovery is not. There is a long and hard road ahead, and there are many Australians who continue to do it very tough in the face of this large economic shock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a consumption led recovery in the context of today's national accounts—a boost in consumption of 7.9 per cent, a significant reflection of the fact that the virus is coming under control and people are going about their daily lives. The biggest increase has been in transport, in cafes, in restaurants and in hotels. There were big jumps in every state and territory, bar Victoria. We saw a 6.8 per cent increase in New South Wales, a 6.8 per cent increase in Queensland, a 6.7 per cent increase in South Australia, a 5.5 per cent increase in Tasmania, a 4.9 per cent increase in Western Australia, a six per cent increase in the Northern Territory and a two per cent increase in the ACT, but a one per cent fall in Victoria. But for the situation in Victoria, if Victoria had achieved the same GDP growth that we'd seen across the other states, the GDP growth number for the September quarter would have been five per cent, not 3.3 per cent.</span>

                  </a>  Unlike those opposite we are not talking down the Australian economy. We are pointing to the successful economic indicators that are showing Australians getting back into work. What the Governor of the Reserve Bank has said is that the Morrison government's economic response has been the right response. What the Governor of the Reserve Bank said just this morning is that the economic recovery is underway. And what the Governor of the Reserve Bank has repeatedly referenced is programs like JobKeeper, with the Reserve Bank of Australia saying that our JobKeeper program has saved at least 700,000 jobs. At least 700,000 jobs have been saved by our JobKeeper program. We have seen in the recent ATO data for the month of October that there are two million fewer Australians on JobKeeper and 450,000 fewer Australian businesses on JobKeeper in the month of October compared to the month of September.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Governor of the Reserve Bank is absolutely right. The road ahead will be long, will be hard and will be bumpy, and the effects will be felt for years and years to come. But he also makes the very valid point that the economic recovery is underway and that the Morrison government's policies are doing what they have been intended to do to get Australians back into work.</span>

Many retirees have put savings in government guaranteed term deposits because they are concerned about the share market and need cash reserves to help them get through. With the current cash rate at 0.1 per cent and term deposits at 0.6 per cent at best, the upper deeming rate of 2.25 per cent is clearly too high. Treasurer, when will the government assist older Australians and cut the deeming rate?</span>

On 12 March this year the minister for social services announced that the government had made a decision to reduce the deeming rates by 50 basis points each. On 22 March it was announced the deeming rates would be cut by a further 25 basis points. These reductions reflected the low interest rate environment that the honourable member has pointed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 1 May a lower deeming rate of 25 basis points and an upper deeming rate of 2.25 per cent applied. As the honourable member will be aware, the deeming rate takes into account the returns that can be achieved by investors on a range of assets—not just cash deposits, it can be on stocks in the stock market, fixed interest investments and a whole range of assets—hence there are two levels to the deeming rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our changes to the deeming rates have benefited around 900,000 income support recipients, including 565,000 people on the age pension. As a result, they will get, on average, an additional $313 from the age pension in the first full year that the reduced rates apply, and this is expected to be at a cost of $876 million over the forward estimates. So I would say to the honourable member that the government has already acted on deeming rates. We continue to monitor movements, obviously, in the cash rate, but the government has taken action which has benefited pensioners right across the country.</span>

I acknowledge that in his electorate around 70,000 taxpayers are benefiting from the tax cuts that we announced in this year's budget and subsequently legislated. In the honourable member's electorate of Menzies, some 7,000 businesses have been benefiting from JobKeeper, and that JobKeeper program and those JobKeeper payments have been an economic lifeline to millions of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member refers to the various incentives that the government has been providing both to households and to businesses to support them through this once-in-a-century economic shock. That has included tax cuts—bringing forward by two years our legislated tax cuts and adding an additional year of the LMITO, the low- and middle-income tax offset. Those tax cuts are already starting to flow through to the bank balances of Australians right across the country. According to Treasury, those tax cuts will help create around 50,000 jobs. A key characteristic of this year's budget, on 6 October, was that the government doesn't see itself as the solution. The government sees itself as a catalyst for a private-sector-led recovery to this economic shock. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With nearly nine out of every ten Australian jobs in the private sector, what we did in this budget was put in place incentives to encourage more investment—for example, the loss carry-back measure, as well as the immediate expensing incentive that applies to businesses with a turnover of up to $5 billion. This will cover around $200 billion of investment, and it will strongly support small businesses, because small businesses will be selling that new machinery or equipment. They'll be installing it. They'll be servicing it. They'll be buying it themselves, for their own businesses. We've met many businesses across the country that are taking advantage of not just the loss carry-back but also the instant asset write-off and the immediate expensing. In this budget, there was also the JobMaker hiring credit, which will help support up to around 450,000 jobs across the economy and which was legislated through the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these measures are helping to drive more people into work. Just last night we saw the OECD upgrade its economic forecast for Australia, and just today we have seen the largest increase in quarterly GDP, of 3.3 per cent, since 1976. So the Morrison government is getting on with the job it was elected by the Australian people to do, which was to help create jobs right across the country and help keep people in secure work. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

How many of the nearly one million unemployed Australians would have a job if the government spent more time on jobs and less time on marketing and slogans?</span>

The Australian economy is coming back. The economic recovery is underway and this economic recovery, this comeback, belongs to the Australian people. The economy is coming back because of the hard work of millions of Australians right across the country and because of the measures that we on this side of the House have supported, like JobKeeper, which supported 3.6 million Australians in September; like JobSeeker, which effectively doubled the safety net; like the cash flow boost, which has provided working capital to businesses right across the country; like our two $750 payments to millions of pensioners; and like our HomeBuilder program, which has provided a spark to ignite the housing industry. Today, in the national accounts, dwelling investment was up 0.6 per cent after eight consecutive quarterly falls. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what we're seeing across the economy. The jobs are coming back and economic activity is gaining pace. Now, the AAA credit rating of the government has been reaffirmed. We've heard the Governor of the Reserve Bank himself talk about how the Morrison government's economic response has been the right response. We saw yesterday that building approvals were up by 3.8 per cent and by 14 per cent through the year. We saw capital city house prices up by 0.7 per cent—the first time we've seen house prices up across all capital cities since the start of the pandemic. We've seen consumer confidence up in 12 of the last 13 weeks. Every economic indicator points to the resilience of the Australian economy, and we know that the jobs are coming back. Of those Australians who either lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero at the start of the crisis, 80 per cent are now back at work. This economic recovery, this comeback, belongs to every Australian.</span>

We were there last week, weren't we, Member for New England—in the Hunter, talking about announcing that $560 million commitment for the Singleton bypass. Every day, 26,000 vehicles, including 3,700 trucks, rumble through Singleton. We want to get those vehicles and many of those trucks out of the CBD and onto the Singleton bypass. We're going to do it, Member for New England—and it's great to see the member for Hunter has come back into the chamber today. We were there last week. We were talking about infrastructure, we were talking about jobs and we were talking about the comeback. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the member for New England's electorate, there are 20,000 small businesses, 6,100 of which have benefited from JobKeeper. We regard those businesses highly. We thank them. We're grateful to them for making sure they stayed connected with their employees, making sure they kept their doors open, making sure they turned the wheels of the local economy. I know the member for New England supports each and every one of those small businesses and each and every one of those workers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also great last week to be in Toowoomba, another great regional community. Garth Hamilton is going to represent finely the electorate of Groom in this place. He is going to be a superb member for Groom, and we will welcome him into this place very soon. In Toowoomba there was Paul Wiedman, an electrical small business owner and operator, and he was very much looking forward to taking delivery of his new ute that afternoon, paid for under the instant asset write-off. Of course, he had to have the cash flow, but that's going to make sure that his business not only survives through the comeback but indeed thrives. He was also making sure that he increased his business. The Treasurer will be very interested to know that back in March Paul was looking to downsize his business but, when the Treasurer announced JobKeeper, that gave Paul the incentive, the impetus, the optimism, the hope and the opportunity to add two new apprentices under the wage subsidy, to add to the instant asset write-off and to buy a new ute. It gave him the confidence to increase his business, and that's fantastic. He provides electrical work for households and for commercial businesses, so he was also delighted with the HomeBuilder program because, of course, new homes need wiring and he's going to be able to provide that service with the two new apprentices. He's a great businessman getting on with the job of creating opportunities for Toowoomba. The member for New England knows how important infrastructure and small business are. That's what we're doing: recovering from COVID-19 and getting on with the job.</span>

One would think, at a time of an increasingly complex strategic environment, that the Prime Minister of this country becoming the first foreign leader to be invited to Japan to meet with Prime Minister Suga is a very significant reflection on the positive bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan. So I'd say to those opposite that, instead of making a mockery of an important visit on behalf of this nation, they should understand the significance of Australia's bilateral relationship with Japan, which has been advanced by our Prime Minister's historic visit only weeks ago.</span>

As Gold Coast MPs, we know just how important small businesses are to the economy, because we've got about 80,000 small businesses on the Gold Coast and we know that they are the heart and soul of our community. That is the situation right across Australia; small businesses really are the engine room of our economy. That's why this government rolled up its sleeves when COVID-19 struck to make sure that we could cushion the blow as much as possible and support our small businesses and the roughly six million Australians that are employed by small businesses. We know that JobKeeper has been, and continues to be, a lifeline for so many of our small businesses. But, promisingly, more and more of those small businesses are getting back on their feet. Our $74 billion JobMaker plan puts small business at the heart of our economic recovery, and we have put in place a number of measures that are specifically targeted to support our small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put in place some incentives for small businesses to employ and to invest. We have implemented programs that will support small businesses to innovate and to grow, and we have introduced reforms to make it easier for small businesses to do business. We are backing our small businesses right across Australia to invest in themselves and to employ more Australians. One of the most important things that we have been able to do is to expand the instant asset write-off, because that has been such a bonus and such an incentive to so many small businesses as they are struggling to get back on their feet. But the recovery has not been so smooth for all of our small businesses across Australia, and that's why we did step in to support travel agents. Eligible agents will have access to a one-off payment of between $1,500 and $100,000 to help them continue to navigate the challenges of COVID-19. It is really important that we support our travel agents, but we also support every small business right across Australia. So I encourage all Australians, when you're doing shopping for Christmas, to go to your local small business and support them, because every single cent that you spend supporting a small business keeps jobs in Australia.</span>

Persa is a pre-press operator who has worked at Ovato's Clayton site for 30 years. Like 300 of her fellow workers, she will be made redundant before Christmas. Persa won't get the money she's owed, and she'll have to wait until next year to receive any funds through the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. Minister, why is your government congratulating itself and using marketing slogans when workers like Persa are left out in the cold by this unscrupulous conduct?</span>

Both of the parties in that matter will no doubt make very strong arguments, and I think there are very strong arguments to be made on behalf of the workers that you're speaking to. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee is the established backstop to ensure that, if that litigation does not end the way that the workers from Ovato are arguing that it should, they have a guarantee of those entitlements. Obviously, the government will be keeping a very close eye on that litigation and will be ensuring that entitlements that are not paid through that process are paid through the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, as they usually are, as millions of dollars have been during the COVID pandemic and as will be the case here, depending on how that litigation ends. But we are not a party to that litigation.</span>

As the Treasurer indicated in his earlier answers, there are obviously parts of the economy that are harder hit than others during COVID-19 and they'll be a particular focus of the government. Through the working group process, where we've looked into key areas of potential industrial relations reform, we've had the benefit of data from the Fair Work Commission, which is a combination of both payroll data and survey material unique to the Fair Work Commission data, and that data confirms what common sense would tell us—that some of the key areas in the most distress have been the accommodation and food services sector, the retail trade sector, the arts and recreation sector and the aviation sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fact that's clear is that small businesses, particularly in the accommodation and food sector and also very much the retail sector, have the highest level of award reliance. So in those most distressed industries with the greatest award reliance there is a real capacity to assist those industries in their comeback by looking at the relevant awards. One part of the key awards that has varied considerably from industry sector to industry sector is with respect to the flexibility that the award might allow employers and employees, relating to restrictions on how they can work together to agree on more hours, on a needs basis, for permanent part-time workers on usual wage rate payments. In some awards, that can be agreed fairly simply. In other awards, even if you have complete agreement between the employer and the employee, there are very significant restrictions that discourage that type of agreement for extra hours being made, so hours never get offered by the business and everyone loses out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Say you've got a situation, for instance, in the hospitality award, where there's considerable flexibility for more hours at usual wage rates to be given to permanent part-time employees, but in other awards, like in the retail sector, which is very hard hit during COVID, you don't have that flexibility. The difficulty is that where you do have that flexibility it also flows through into the enterprise agreements, and where you don't it doesn't flow through. So where you have enterprise agreements with flexibility, like Coles and Woolworths, and they have this flexibility to offer extra hours to permanent part-time employees, they actually have 75 per cent of their employees on an ongoing—permanent—rather than casual basis, which is well over 10 per cent above the industry average. If, in this process, we can find a way to ensure that where businesses are coming out of the COVID recession and there are more hours to offer they can do that simply by reasonable and fair agreement with their own part-time permanent employees, so they can get extra hours at their usual rates of pay, that would represent a barrier to more work, more permanent work, and more hours that through this process we can conceivably take down.</span>

In the past fortnight 350 workers at the Coles Smeaton Grange depot in my electorate were locked out of their workplace during a dispute over better pay and conditions. Coles has closed the depot for three months. Why is the government congratulating itself and using marketing slogans when 350 families in my electorate will have their incomes slashed over Christmas because of this unscrupulous conduct?</span>

I would invite the member to provide any further details that he's got, with respect to that particular issue, to my office. We have been obviously monitoring the way retail organisations, such as Coles and Woolworths, are engaging with their workers. We're clearly aware of it but there are some details there that I have heard for the first time, and I would very much like to receive further details on that. Whether or not that sort of a lockout is properly conducted because of economic conditions that are affecting retail is something that has to be determined. But if you've got further information on that particular issue I'd, certainly, warmly ask you to send that to my office and we will look at it.</span>

Despite the fact that agriculture has faced up to drought, fires, floods and now COVID-19 it's continued to prove that it is still one of the bedrocks of our nation's economy. ABARES previously estimated that despite all these headwinds we would, this year, have an agricultural industry of $61 billion, up from $60 billion. Next week ABARES will update that outlook, and we're predicting that it will in fact go higher, such has been the strength of the agricultural sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the reasoning behind the ambitious goal of growing agriculture to $100 billion by 2030, and in this year's budget the government backed that, our own Ag2030 plan, with cold hard cash. There are seven pillars to our 2030 plan. The first is around exports, with over $300 million to invest in modernising our trading platforms, and complementary measures, particularly around regulatory oversight not only to protect our brands but to reduce the costs of regulation in making sure our product gets around the world more quickly. The second pillar—and, many say, the most important—is around biosecurity, protecting brand Australia. There is a record investment in our budget this year of $874 million not just for putting boots and paws on the ground but also for new technology, such as underwater drones that will be under ships, making sure there are no hitchhiker pests; and scanners, in containers, that will detect the movement of insects. So we're looking to technology to protect our brand as well. The third pillar, also about protecting our brand, is around our stewardship—protecting our farmers and our environment for their environmental stewardship and custodianship of the land. There is $34 million to support them and reward them for carbon abatement and improvement in biodiversity, and in terms of how they put that into the market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also looking at supply chains. That's the fourth pillar. There's $1.3 billion under the modernisation of manufacturing in which agriculture is seen as one of the key pillars. And we'll continue to make sure we look at what we're manufacturing and at what we're exporting, but also at our agricultural inputs. Also important is infrastructure—$3½ billion. In wanting to dig dams and plumb the nation, we need the states to come with us, but we've got the chequebook to go with it. We're also looking at our innovation systems. There's $86 million going into new innovation hubs around the country, particularly in regional Australia, where our farmers can adopt the new science and technology not just for drought but for improving productivity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the most important investment is the last pillar, and that is in our people. There is $250 billion in this year's budget to ensure that short courses, particularly in agriculture, can be undertaken and to reduce the cost of agricultural university courses by 59 per cent. So this government will stand with the agricultural sector, whatever headwinds it may face, to help it achieve its goal of $100 billion by 2030. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Darren from Botany is a 52-year-old single dad who has been working as Qantas ground crew for 24 years. He was stood down in March. Darren said he was forced to sell his house to care for his kids and for his dad, who has dementia. He was one of the 2,000 Qantas workers sacked this week. Why is this government congratulating itself and using marketing slogans while workers like Darren are left behind?</span>

I am very sorry to hear Darren's story. I'm sure he's been a fine worker, and certainly we would like to see Darren back—to make sure that he gets another job when the aviation sector returns to some sort of pre-COVID level. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many industries are getting back to where they need to be as far as pre-COVID levels go. But, as Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas, said only recently, even up to Christmas, domestic travel will only be 60 per cent of pre-COVID levels. But what we have done for the aviation industry is provide sector-wide assistance. There has been $2.7 billion of sector-wide assistance through the Domestic Aviation Network Support program and through the Regional Airline Network Support program to ensure that we have planes in the air, because, as I've said many times, planes in the air mean jobs on the ground. And we need to see more planes in the air; we need to see more jobs in the aviation sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that the member for Kingsford Smith certainly comes from an electorate very near Mascot. I appreciate that he has engaged with these employees, as I have. We want to see more people working in the aviation sector, but it's been very tough with the border closures, appreciating the fact that Western Australia made the announcement only this week about resuming domestic travel and lifting those border restrictions for other states. It's been very, very tough, with border closures in many Australian states. Also, appreciating the fact that international travel is of course very, very restricted, we're bringing as many Australians home as we can. We're making sure that those stranded Aussies have access to get home before Christmas. It is so tough on international inbound tourism and stranded Aussies coming home. It's so tough domestically and so tough regionally. But that's what we have done. On a sector-wide assistance basis, we have provided that support to the entire aviation sector, with $2.7 billion worth of support through JobKeeper, DANS and RANS. We want to continue, we will continue and must continue to support the aviation sector, but, as I say, it is very tough, particularly for people like Darren. We will continue to provide the support as necessary.</span>

Many of them are the hardworking men and women of the resources sector, who have been out there doing what was necessary in recent months to maintain not only their jobs but their employing businesses, their sector, Australia's reputation and, of course, Australia's economy. I put my thanks to them on the table once again. Our economic recovery has been in no small part thanks to the decisions and the work of those Australians right around the nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member knows that the Port of Gladstone, which I have visited a number of times, is an incredibly important part of the sector. In fact, over 1,900 vessels visit the port every year, and 70 per cent of those vessels are seeking our coal; some 20 per cent are seeking our gas. They are looking to ship them to markets all around the world, helping to build our economy and jobs for Australians in this country. The member knows as well that the Australian resources sector deserves a gold star in terms of the economy and what they have done. To quote the Attorney-General yesterday, their performance in recent months has been 'nothing short of remarkable'. It has been remarkable, resilient, outstanding and fantastic, and they deserve every piece of recognition that they are getting from us and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to support the resources sector through the $225 million Exploring for the Future program, $53 million for gas-fired recovery and $30 million for the Central Queensland University School of Mining and Manufacturing, because we understand how important the sector is to Australia, its economy and its ability to drive more jobs, more GDP and more opportunities for Australians, particularly in areas like Flynn in Central Queensland—home to coal, home to exports, home to jobs, home to the fighter for Flynn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are great opportunities right across our country in the resources sector, and we will continue to support them as they support us. No matter whether it's iron ore, coal, gold—pick your poison! All of those commodities are doing great guns; they're doing an incredibly good job. Our coal is some of the highest-quality coal in the world. There's $55 billion in the sector and 48,000 jobs. I was in the Hunter recently to see how good a job they're doing, and roughly 96 per cent of what comes out of the Port of Newcastle is coal exported to the world and providing opportunities. And it's not just about exports. If we look at the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain Project in Victoria, what are they using as feedstock to produce hydrogen? Brown coal. It's cheap, affordable and in Victoria, and they're using it. There's an opportunity here into the future, and we will continue to drive those opportunities.</span>

                  </a>  This is how these laws work, and understanding how they work allows you a path through to whatever changes can be made here to ensure greater safety. But there's no doubt that there are issues to be addressed here as the gig economy gets well and truly indentured into the area of deliveries and food deliveries. We had a conversation about that. There's no doubt there that there is a leadership role for the Commonwealth to play, and what I've undertaken to do is to ensure that that issue—as to how these particular sectors of the gig economy are operating under state based occupational health and safety laws—goes right onto the agenda of the relevant ministerial council that deals with those, and that we can use Safe Work Australia to shepherd that process to try and understand exactly how those laws are not operating in the most efficient way with respect to those drivers. There clearly is an issue here, and my deepest sympathies exist for those families and drivers who had these accidents. It was a productive meeting that we had yesterday. There is work to be done here, but we can't lose sight of the fact there is a predominant effect here of state occupational health and safety laws. There is a leadership role for the Commonwealth to play, but the primary response is at a state level. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first role of our government is to make sure that we can keep Australians safe. We've endeavoured to do that by closing our borders internationally to keep Australians safe from COVID-19, and we have worked very hard off the back of that to rebuild the economy and help people get back into work. But it is apparent to all Australians—certainly it should be apparent to all Australians—that to have a secure nation is absolutely non-negotiable as a precondition to us being able to have a prosperous nation. We won't compromise on that principle. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of our service men and women, both domestically and internationally, is something that should be of great pride to all Australians. The work that they do has to be backed up by the appropriate investment, and that's why we are putting a record amount of money—in fact, more money than any government since Federation—into our defence personnel. We are very proud of that. It's as a result of having managed the budget well over a number of years, making tough decisions, that we can invest into our Australian Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next decade we are spending $270 billion—an amazing investment and a well-deserved investment for those men and women. We know that that work to modernise the Australian Army, to make sure that we can invest, for example, $55 billion into the land domain capability over the next 10 years, will make them one of the most professional forces in the world. Under that program, there is a $5 billion Boxer Combat Reconnaissance program. It will deliver 211 vehicles, and the majority of those will be built at Rheinmetall Defence Australia's Redbank facility—not too far from the member's electorate in Queensland. The remarkable thing about that is, over the 30-year life of the Boxer, Australian industry is expected to secure over $10 billion of work. So it means small manufacturing firms in electorates right across Queensland—in fact, right across the country—will be able to provide component parts and work very closely with this program and others. The point is that that investment that we're making is not only supporting our service men and women but creating jobs in the suburbs across the country. So, at a very difficult time in our country's history because of the COVID virus, through our investment in defence we have been able to support people in jobs, and those jobs will continue to grow into the future. It doesn't stop there, of course. We're investing in air and sea capabilities, and we'll make sure that we continue to do that. </span>

Thirty years ago the Hawke government started the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 and that was the beginning of the use of averaged income from the tax department.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's $270 billion worth of defence capability is contributing significantly to the comeback from the COVID-19 recession. We are supporting Aussie jobs and Aussie businesses as we support our men and women in uniform so that they can defend our nation and keep us safe. This week I announced that the Morrison government will invest $220 million in Lendlease to upgrade works at the RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia, supporting some 200 Australian jobs. In the last 12 months, Lendlease has employed more than 18 veterans across Australian on a variety of projects, through groups such as Veterans in Construction and Soldier On. Lendlease says that these veterans have skills and capabilities that are incredibly valued in the civilian workforce, and I congratulate Lendlease on their employment of veterans right across Australia. Whilst I am on my feet, I encourage our other industry partners to employ more veterans and those transitioning from the ADF, so that they can take advantage of their incredible and invaluable skill set.</span>

I'm very proud to say that, just last week, Penten was named the Cyber Business of the Year at the Defence Connect Australian Defence Industry Awards—so very big congratulations to Penten. With the government's support, Penten has been able to grow during COVID and has just hired their 100th employee. Well done to Penten!</span>

Recently I was contacted by Adam Evans, who is the managing director of Anywise, and he said: 'Thank you for your ongoing support.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the House, Minister for Defence Personnel and Minister for Veterans' Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  I thank the member for Herbert for his question and recognise his service in uniform to our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout our nation's history, more than two million Australians have served with great distinction in uniform, and often they are the first people that we turn to when problems get too big for our state agencies. We saw it last summer with Operation Bushfire Assist, we've seen it all this year with COVID-19 and we've relied on them for peacekeeping missions and conflicts throughout our nation's history. That service to our nation can have impacts. When you consider that, in 2020, the average Defence Force career is about seven years, we need transition measures in place, and they need a partnership between the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Australian Defence Force, ex-service organisations and the community at large. I want to stress, though, that, for the majority of men and women who serve, that transition goes very well. But there is no question that some do require additional support. My message today to those serving men and women and our veterans community is that help is available. You are not alone. The Open Arms counselling service is available on 1800011046. It's not a sign of weakness to reach out for help; in fact, it's a sign of strength and it's also a chance to get better sooner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians can be very proud of the support that's actually in place for our veterans community and for the wellbeing of their families. We provide, through the Australian taxpayers, more than $11 billion per year, with $230 million specifically put aside for mental health programs to support the mental wellbeing of our veteran community. There's no question that 2020 has been a very tough and challenging year for many people, and the recent media coverage has certainly added to the anxiety and stress for many in our community. The last thing that our veterans need now, that Australian Defence Force families need now, is our judgement. They need our support. They don't need our judgement; they need our support. The overwhelming majority of Australian service men and women throughout our nation's history have served with great distinction and they can be proud of that service: you have nothing but the respect and thanks of a grateful nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not allow the alleged action of a small number of people to define or in any way diminish the service of the vast majority of men and women. We need to let the process take its course. As I mentioned earlier, it's a partnership between our veterans, our serving men and women, their families and the broader community. I urge all of our veterans and all of our serving members to check on their mates. Maybe ring four or five of them up this week. Check on your mates. Support each other. I urge the Australian people to continue to support them through the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the ex-service community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish where I started and just say, simply, thank you to our service men and women. From the recruits who I watched march out of Kapooka last week right through to the Chief of the Defence Force: we respect you; please continue to serve with the pride that you rightfully hold and please uphold the values of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SHORTEN:</span>
                </a>  Yesterday, in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Government Services said, about our concerns on disability during COVID:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At no point at all did the opposition raise any issues with the government's response—at no time at all.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But I've checked the records. On nine occasions we raised these issues with the minister. We raised them in correspondence with him on 19 March 2020. We raised them again with him and Senator Ruston on 9 April. We again raised our concerns about disability being neglected by the government on 15 July 2020, and again we raised them on 27 July. We also issued media statements on four occasions, including on 20 March. We also did interviews on television and radio—and I include those—on 29 July, 14 July, 9 August and 16 August. Even more remarkably, in the minister's misrepresentation of Labor and what we've done he said he'd had no correspondence from us, but in fact he has written back to us about our correspondence on two occasions. On 14 May he wrote a four-page letter to me which said that there were no problems. Of course, that was before the royal commission revealed them. Again, the forgetful minister, who didn't realise that we'd raised it with him, has now got to the point where he has forgotten the letter that he sent to us on 15 September. We raised the problems of disability care in COVID. The government and the minister fundamentally misrepresented our position, and he should come into the House and withdraw.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  What could be more symbolic than a Prime Minister appearing in this parliament projected on a screen, a virtual PM—from hollow man to hologram? That's what we have—more promo than ScoMo. There he is in quarantine for two weeks, and he could have taken anyone with him—the head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, an economic adviser or a national security adviser—but who did he take? His photographer, because that was the priority for this Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who believes you can fake it until you make it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is not a Prime Minister—more a prime marketer. We've seen it with the advertising campaign, paid for by taxpayers, with over a million dollars paid to Crosby Textor for feeding into their questions and answers in question time. What we see from this Prime Minister and this government is all about the marketing and never about the substance. It's all about the announcement and never about the delivery. Look at infrastructure. There's a $6.8 billion gap between what they said on budget night they would spend and what they've actually spent. You can't actually drive on a promise; you need to drive on a road, and you need to ride on a train. You need to fix a project like Inland Rail that doesn't even go to a port.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government where, when you look at the announcement, you wait for the delivery and it just doesn't happen. Remember the National Integrity Commission, announced way back in 2018? But there's nothing—just crickets. The Emergency Response Fund is $4 billion, $200 million each year, so they've had $400 million available to them this year, and not a dollar has been spent. This morning, with the member for Eden-Monaro and the shadow minister Senator Watt, we were out in Braidwood talking to Rural Fire Service cadets and to the people who protected those communities. I tell you what those students in that cadet program could do with: a bit more input and a bit more funding. There is $200 million available but, from those opposite, not a dollar has been spent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The arts sector rescue package—remember that? Two hundred and fifty million dollars was announced with Guy Sebastian. Twenty per cent of that has been allocated up to this point. Even Guy Sebastian has taken to social media to say, 'What is actually going on?' But that's not the worst. The Boosting Female Founders Initiative is, perhaps. Two years ago it was announced, and there has been not a dollar invested and not a dollar spent, and this year in the budget they announced round 2. They haven't spent a dollar in round 1, but they've announced round 2.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy, of which three per cent is available this year. Anyone would think that there hasn't been a recession going on. Three per cent is available this year. Then there's the NAIF, with $5 billion announced five years ago. How much has been spent? One hundred and sixty-nine million dollars. No wonder we call it the 'no actual infrastructure fund'. Then there's the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility. It's a doozy. It was announced way back in May 2016. They have had no fewer than 50 media announcements and press releases. Not a dollar has been spent, and now it's been abolished. All it produced was 50 media releases. Then there's a range of other projects. They have a Threatened Species Recovery Fund. That's not about small-l liberals in the Liberal Party; it's actually about koalas and other threatened species. But what we know is that there's no habitat they're not prepared to rip down under this minister for koalas and other endangered species. So one of the themes of this government is that it's all announcement, no delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another big theme as well: the wasted recovery—waste and mismanagement. Robodebt's the worst—an illegal, cruel scheme that led to self-harm and to people literally taking their own lives. What we get from those opposite is just nonsense, absolute nonsense. When we had the question asked at the end of question time, what we had from those opposite was just contempt for the processes here. It was pointed out that they were threatening that people would go to prison. That's what they were threatening. At the same time, they said, 'We'll track you down,' for a scheme that they knew at the time was illegal. That was what Minister Tudge had to say. There's been a settlement that cost $1.2 billion, but they say: 'Oh, we haven't admitted there's anything wrong here. We just handed over $1.2 billion. Why not? It's only taxpayers' money.' Just extraordinary!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the NBN. We told them, the world told them and anyone who knew anything about communications told them that, funnily enough, fibre is this century's technology, not copper. But oh, no. They had their mix. Four point five billion dollars they're having to pay to fix up the NBN. Then there's the Leppington Triangle. Thirty million dollars they paid for it—it was worth three million—to a Liberal Party donor—surprise, surprise!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the sports rorts scandal. Remember that? It was worth $100 million. There were the coloured charts in the Prime Minister's office, colour coded by electorate and by marginality. They were not worrying about all those voluntary sports groups that were so naive they believed in the system. Those groups spent hundreds of hours putting together applications, but they never had a chance. What they should have done was just look at the electoral pendulum.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the fact is that under this government there is waste and mismanagement. It is all announcement, no delivery. But there's something else that defines the government as well: the people who have been left behind and the people who've been held back. There are the people left behind in aged care during this crisis—685 deaths. The federal government are responsible for aged care. They fund it, they regulate it and they manage it. Yet there was no COVID plan. This week we learned that they didn't have a COVID plan for people with disabilities either. We learned that from the disability royal commission. We know that, when it comes to child care, not just older people but little people as well miss out under this government. Childcare workers were the first people thrown off support for wage subsidies. We know as well that casuals, arts workers, university workers, dnata workers and people who are visa holders are all missing out on support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, though, has a plan. We have a plan with an emphasis on follow-up and delivery, a plan to create jobs as our first priority. We have a plan for child care economic reform, not welfare, that will increase participation of women in the workforce, a plan for a future built in Australia—whether it's building our trains here, whether it be a power transmission network for the 21st century that will help to make us a renewable energy superpower. We want an economy that's resilient. We want to continue to export resources, but we want to value-add here where we can and make sure that we create high-value jobs here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's our priority, an economy that's resilient, one that recognises the weaknesses that have been exposed during this period. We want a future where no-one is left behind and no-one is held back, a future where aspiration is embraced. We want to create wealth as well as be concerned about its distribution. What that needs is a government that's focused on the national interest, not a government that's obsessed with marketing, that's obsessed with advertising, that is obsessed with having the announcement and not worrying about the follow-up or the delivery. But with this Prime Minister we've seen the priorities exposed, this week, yet again. It's a government that comes in here during question time, gets every question with all the slogans that have been worked out by Crosby Textor, the answers all worked out as well, and there's nothing about the real concerns of Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we asked about those people, such as workers in the gig sector and Qantas workers and others who've lost their jobs and been left behind, but they're too busy self-congratulating themselves, too busy with their hubris and their arrogance. Australians deserve better. We deserve a government that's concerned about the interests of the Australian people—rather than concerned about themselves, like this government is.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  I'm proud to be part of the Morrison government that is delivering for all Australians. When it comes to this place and what we should be doing as MPs, delivery is what counts, and the Morrison government is delivering in spades. As Australians look at this tough year, 2020, we've seen this global COVID-19 pandemic not just go through Australia but go right around the world. Australians know the Morrison government has kept them safe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the Minister for Health say not too long ago? He said he would introduce universal telehealth. What's been delivered, in relation to universal telehealth? We have 12 million people who have accessed 40 million services and over $2 billion in benefits delivered by the Morrison government. Look at GP respiratory clinics. As part of our COVID response we announced $206 million on 11 March this year to raise up to 100 clinics across the country, to provide access to testing. And would you believe that by 19 August there weren't 100 clinics providing this service but 146 clinics operating here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to vaccines, we saw the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister say, on 19 August, 'We announce that we have signed a letter of intent with AstraZeneca to access the Oxford vaccine.' By 4 September we had signed a binding agreement for them to supply 33.8 million doses, and that included, on top of that agreement, a partnership with our very own Australian CSL to manufacture them. That's what delivery is about and that's how the Morrison government is delivering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of my good friend the member for Hinkler, and cabinet minister in the Morrison government, up in Bundaberg. Before the last election, the Morrison government committed $7 million to ensure that the Fraser Coast—not far from you, Mr Deputy Speaker—had its own palliative care centre in Bundaberg. That now has been delivered, the sod has been turned and construction is starting. Look at the Butterfly Foundation. In April 2019 we announced $4.5 million for the this foundation, a specialist eating disorder centre on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Building is underway. You can check with the member for Fisher on how that's going. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own department, the Department of Social Services, the Morrison government are supercharging our safety net, delivering additional support to Australians doing it tough through this extraordinarily difficult period. We're doing this by delivering on our committed announcements. For example, in relation to social housing and community housing in the Hobart City Deal, we promised 100 social houses worth $25 million. To date, 48 dwellings are complete, another 24 homes are currently occupied by tenants and a further 26 dwellings are close to completion, with more to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 8.7 million volunteers in Australia, and, in the wake of the bushfires and a global pandemic, the contributions our volunteers make are vital. Volunteers are local champions. Yesterday, I announced a further $2.7 million for community volunteers across 779 local organisations, including all of yours. This is on top of the government's funding boost of $9 million earlier this year, in May, for 2,698 local places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow, of course, for the House, is International Day of People with Disability, and it's important we work every day to ensure inclusion of Australians living with disability. The NDIS is now supporting about 412,000 Australians with disability, an increase of approximately 100,000 participants in the last 12 months alone. Around 193,000 are receiving supports for the very first time under the Morrison government. I'm pleased that we have bipartisan support on that. We've continued to deliver significant and immediate improvements to the NDIS, and the latest NDIS quarterly report verifies that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we heard from the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Minister Taylor. He was saying, 'When the Morrison government makes commitments'—in relation to our international commitments—'we meet them and we beat them.' This is evidenced by the release of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly update of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ustralia's national greenhouse gas inventory: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span style="font-style:italic;">une 2020</span>. The update confirms that the Morrison government has beaten our 2020 target by 459 million tonnes. Emissions are now 16.6 per cent lower than 2005 levels.</span>

                  </a>  Unlike Labor—unlike these people interjecting—we actually have a 2030 target. That mob over there still can't work out whether they're Arthur or Martha. Look at Defence—we're absolutely helping our Australian Defence Force personnel. We know that those opposite cut $18 billion out of Defence. They gutted Defence. They brought it down to 1½ per cent of GDP. We said before the 2013 election that we would increase Defence investment to two per cent of GDP, and we've now beaten that. We've delivered that—once again, the Morrison government delivering. That runs across Air Force, Navy, Army—I could go through all the infrastructure that we've delivered, and I'm very proud to be a part of the government that is delivering it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at infrastructure, not just in my electorate but in all 151 electorates around this country, the Morrison government has committed to over 1,000 major land transport infrastructure projects, of which, would you believe, 399 have been completed, 195 are under construction or underway and 481 are in planning, and we've committed to more than 31,000 smaller transport infrastructure projects, of which 2,900 have been completed and delivered. Nearly 2,600 are planned and underway. I only have to look in my own electorate to know what's being delivered. These are all projects that we promised before the last election. Construction of an autism hub, the AEIOU, in north Brisbane, in Pine Rivers, a $4½ million project that the member for Dickson and I promised, is now completed, helping young children with autism get a great start in life. The shade cloth and upgrades for the Aspley Memorial Bowls Club—$590,000—has been delivered. It's up and running. The member for Sydney should come up and have a bowl! It's done and delivered.</span>

Since the 2019 election in May, we have delivered tax cuts, and what that means is—listen carefully—if you were earning $50,000, you used to pay 19 cents in the dollar on the first $37,000; you now pay 19 cents in the dollar up to $45,000.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, member for Cooper. We have also increased the threshold up to $120,000 where you pay 32½ cents. What that means is that for every tradie, every nurse, every police officer, every teacher and everyone who does overtime they are no longer going to get hit with a big tax bill, because we have delivered tax cuts which will help with bracket creep, which will put more money in people's pockets this financial year when they most need it during this difficult COVID year. So, if you want to talk about delivery, I've just named a few items. The Morrison government is delivering in spades. We don't take it for granted. We won't be arrogant. And we'll continue to do it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  This projection, this pixelated, paused Prime Minister, comes to us remotely—he doesn't have enough bandwidth to come to us with clarity, and the audio certainly leaves a lot to be desired. I think it is emblematic of a prime minister leading a government that is all about spin and not about substance. How can the people who elected me, the good people of Paterson, put their trust in this government, a government that has been at the wheel for eight years and yet has achieved so little? And some what they have achieved has actually been patently illegal, as we're learning from robodebt. It's a scandal. I stand here today and hear the minister say, 'Oh no. We've been using average incomes for X number of years,' and he said when they were starting to be used. The true question that needs to be asked of this government is: when did human oversight stop being used? It stopped under this government. So, if they want to talk about delivery, the one thing that this government has delivered is an illegal debt scheme. They have delivered heartbreak to families of Australia who do not deserve it. They have delivered deceit at monumental levels. They have delivered waste. They paid $30 million for a $3 million block of land in Western Sydney in the Leppington Triangle. The money that has gone, wasted by this government, really is eye-watering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister visited my electorate just a couple of months ago, in October, to posture on a new gas-fired power station. If he was serious, those jobs would be welcomed in my electorate. However, the industry has said that there is not a chance that it's going to be needed. So he just came up to make a big man of himself in my community, in my home town, in the hope that the people would think: 'Well, this government's good. They're going to build this gas-fired power station. That's going to bring my energy bills down.' Let me tell you, after 20 energy policies—they're not policies; they're actually just thought bubbles!—we still do not have lower electricity prices. We've still not done anything meaningful in relation to delivering better outcomes for our environment. And we are still waiting on where the energy is actually going to come from. I know this topic so well because I have the New South Wales and the eastern seaboard battery in my electorate, and it is in the form of an aluminium smelter. On the weekend, when it was clocking over 40 degrees, it was the smelter in my electorate that had to be curtailed so that we had enough energy in New South Wales to keep the air con running. For the members of the government who say, 'The Labor Party doesn't understand energy,' we actually understand it very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, one of the things that really makes me absolutely wonder about this whole question of delivery versus announcement is when this government says: 'Well, it's not up to us. The market will sort it out.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms SWANSON:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, I know—very convenient. Thank you, Member for Brand, for that interjection. This government has done more to divide the market from what it's supposed to be achieving in this country than any other Liberal market faced government in the modern history of Australian politics. The market and the states have had to get into gear when it comes to climate and energy. They say that nature abhors a vacuum. So much so is the vacuum from this government that the state premiers have had to step in to fill it, because this Prime Minister and this energy minister have sucked all of the life out of anything that might have resembled a decent energy policy in this term of government. The state coalition energy minister is running around writing his own rules on energy policy and is refusing to consult with federal colleagues and his Prime Minister. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  When you get a MPI and it has the words 'government' and 'delivery' in it, it has to be a dorothy dixer. Seriously! If we want to talk about delivery, every member on this side could stand here for the full 10 minutes and talk about everything that they've delivered not just nationally but across their electorates. When you look at this year, if you look what happened in this country this year, there have been two major themes. This country has faced great challenges. It's faced a health challenge and it has faced an economic challenge. That has obviously not just been for Australia but for the whole globe. And on both measurements Australia is a standout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're a standout on the health challenge. When comparing Australia's health stats on coronavirus—the number of infections and the number of fatalities—with international comparisons, we have done very well. There was a hiccup, and that hiccup was in Victoria, but we'll leave that aside for today. Generally speaking we have done very well as a national government, as have a lot of the state governments. I congratulate the New South Wales state government for their handling of the coronavirus while keeping their borders relatively open compared to a lot of other state governments. They have done very well there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, there have been the economic challenges. If you look at the falloff in GDP of a lot of countries and unemployment rates across the globe, which have gone up, again, while we have challenges, this government has done well on a lot of those. We've seen growth figures in the last couple of days and consumer confidence numbers which, while we're not out of the woods, at least give us some cause for great optimism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To touch on a couple of national issues first, in the last sitting week we had a very similar MPI. I was talking about some of the local projects that I've had the privilege to deliver as an MP for my local region, and I didn't get through them, so I'm going to pick it up from where I left it last time. But first let's go to the budget. We on this side of the House are very conscious that the private sector is the main driving force of our economy. Eight out of 10 jobs are in the private sector. We know that and we are very much doing everything we can to help the private sector grow us out of the situation we're in. The previous assistant minister was talking about the tax cuts that were given to 11½ million people. We know that the Australian public know how to spend their money, and we want more of their money in their pockets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The JobMaker Hiring Credit—$200 a week to encourage people to employ young people on JobSeeker—was another initiative in the budget. Another great one is the instant tax write-off. I remember when we did this four or five years ago, and it was much smaller in scale with the size of businesses that could apply and the amount. That has been a driving force. We put that onto steroids, again, because we know that the private sector will help us grow out of this. There's much more in the budget. I have the pleasure of having the Minister for Defence Industry behind me—and there's an amazing $270 billion over a 10-year plan for defence industries—and she's a driving force in the economic recovery of this nation as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will pick up on some local deliveries, some of the things that I've had the great pleasure of being part of delivering in my local economy and region. I will just mention it again: the Pacific Highway is the big daddy of those—a $5 billion project, all about reducing fatalities in our region. In fact we always said when we got into government that we wanted this completed by 2020, and guess what? It's going be completed by 2020. We have one section to go: it's about a 10-kilometre section just south of Woodburn. Another section opened last week, so we will have delivered on that promise all about reducing fatalities, a great economic boon as well—2,500 jobs there directly when it was being built. Obviously, it's making our region much closer for tourism, and for our producers and exporters to get their products and services to market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me pick up: I think we arrived in Casino, and I was talking about the wonderful beef capital of Australia, Casino, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker. We were talking about the $40 million saleyards that have been delivered there. We've had bushfires and also drought, and a lot of the stimulus packages we're doing with the New South Wales government. We were in Casino about two or three weeks ago, and part of the stimulus package that we're sending there is to completely revamp the local showgrounds, build a new equestrian centre and upgrade the racecourse. We know showgrounds bring a lot of people and the equestrian centre will bring a whole new group of tourists to our region. That was announced and will be delivered—very exciting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can tell the health of a rural town or city by what is going on in the industrial precinct. The industrial precinct is really important. Richmond Valley Council came to me, and they want theirs extended. We're going to upgrade the industrial precinct in Casino—and, again, I'll come back another time and finish this; there's much more to go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  The topic for today's debate is the government's focus on announcement, not delivery. The only hard thing about that is choosing which of the literally hundreds of examples of exaggeration, spin, fake announcements and utter nonsense to talk about today. We just sat through question time and we heard about the government's new slogan. They spent $15 million on an advertising agency to come up with 'Comeback' and they're now putting it on bus shelters and billboards across the country, congratulating themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a non-traditional approach for this debate just for a minute. The situation the country faces is deadly serious. We're in the midst of the first recession for 30 years and growth, as we hear from the government all the time, is only part of the story. By Christmas, on their own projections, there'll be 1.8 million of our fellow Australians living off unemployment benefits of some sort. Unemployment and underemployment are at record levels, the highest ever, in this country. The economy was weak before the recession, and the government's best outcome they hope for is: it'll take four years to get back to where we were. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got the biggest budget deficit ever—$1.7 trillion of Liberal debt we're hurtling towards with nothing to show for it: no reform, no jobs plan. We've got a water, climate and extinction crisis; bushfires and floods that we're not prepared for; and the most serious set of strategic challenges and circumstances since World War II. Power is shifting rapidly round the region. It's economic power, military power. We've got a trade crisis. We've got billions of dollars of our exports sitting in ships off the coast of China, our major trading partner. The relationship with China is the worst it's been for over 50 years because this incompetent bunch of marketing fools have so mismanaged the diplomatic relationship that there are no ministers to even talk to other ministers. They've outsourced foreign policy to backbenchers, because the foreign minister's so weak she doesn't say anything. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the very moment our nation needs capable leaders, strong government, adult government, what do we have? We have a government led by a failed marketing guy, a fake—an ad man without a plan, the guy who was sacked as the head of Tourism Australia; all announcement, no delivery; all about the photo-op, no follow-up. He's been in quarantine for two weeks, and what does he choose to do? You get one person on the island with you. You might take the head of the public service. You might take the national security adviser, given what's happening around the world. You might take your economics adviser. You might take the Chief Scientist and learn something—facts, evidence—or the head of the APS. But, no, he takes his personal photographer. It sounds farcical, but it's true. What do taxpayers get for that? Fresh from the fake chicken coop photo before he went into quarantine, we've got photographs of the Prime Minister riding an exercise bike; running around in his shorts and half a suit, looking deranged; and wandering around alone during the day at home by himself in a suit. Then there was the question time special, of course: four flags—you could have fit one more in, maybe, if you'd tried—and a crotch shot for the national parliament. Well done, Prime Minister!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's all about politics, and, you have to admit, he's very good at politics. Truth and facts don't matter anymore. He's like his BFF. He's like a mini-Trump: you just say stuff, and you announce but you don't deliver. Where's the national integrity commission? Anyone? Eighth year of government and no national integrity commission? He went one better there; he actually cut the budget of the Auditor-General, the one independent watchdog we have! What about aged care? 'I'm going to fix the aged-care waiting list.' Every time, every budget, every mid-year budget, he announces it. There are over 100,000 senior Australians waiting for home care; 28,000 people have died waiting for home care in the last two years. Bringing home 36,000 stranded Australians by Christmas—who believes that? Is that actually going to happen? A $1.5 billion manufacturing strategy—this from the mob who chased the car industry out of Australia. They've suddenly decided manufacturing matters! Of $1.5 billion, they're only going to spend three per cent this year. It's a fake announcement. The submarines—how are they going? They were going to be $50 billion and delivered on time. They're running behind time and they're now going to be $80 billion. Who knows? Bushfire recovery—a $2 billion fund and people are living in caravans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is a fake, and people are working him out. But you know what? He's not just a fake; he's a nasty, mean fake, because the one thing he's delivered out of this budget—on time, on budget—is a cut to JobSeeker. The most vulnerable people in the country will be living on $40 a day under this Prime Minister, the biggest single act in the history of the Commonwealth that any government has taken to push 1.5 million Australians into poverty. Australians deserve much better than this nasty, fake Prime Minister. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  Australians know this one thing: they know that this government has their back and now our economy is coming back. It is a comeback. It's happening right now. It's not a slogan. It's not a message. It's not an ad. It's right there in front of the eyes of every Labor MP. Instead of embracing it, instead of embracing the hard work of all Australians, what do Labor want to do? They want to deny it, for political purposes, but they can't stand in the way of the facts—a 3.3 per cent jump in September quarter growth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor MPs keep missing what is in front of them. Perhaps they are far too distracted by their own slogans, which don't work, or by their own internal ructions and whether or not somebody is still going to be the leader at the end of the year, but they keep missing what is right in front of them. First they missed that there was a global pandemic, which was why Australia went into recession. Remember? They tried to call it the 'Morrison recession'. That was the Labor Party's slogan. Where's that gone? Gee, we haven't heard much about that lately. Could it be that it just fell flat—that perhaps Australians thought to themselves, 'Actually, we understand that there's a global pandemic that the Morrison government is trying to help us through?' Is it the fact that the Australian people understood, more than the Labor MPs opposite, what was happening? And now those opposite have missed the comeback that is occurring. They want to talk it down, they want to pretend it doesn't exist, they want to pretend that the efforts of hardworking Australians don't exist—they want to diminish that—and they want to diminish the success and the achievements of the government's support programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For goodness sake, they would even deny the important reason that the PM went into quarantine in the first place. He went to Japan to sign an incredibly strategic defence agreement. He is just doing what many Australians have done this year, which is to self-quarantine and to work from home. I think there's a bit of professional jealousy among the Labor MPs, because the Prime Minister has achieved more in two weeks in quarantine than all of the Labor MPs combined have managed to achieve this year when it comes to supporting Australians to get back into jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is delivering the most important commitment to Australians, and that is to get our economy going again and to get them back into work. That is what Australians want from this government. That is what Australians want from the support programs we have delivered. And that is what they're getting in the accounts we saw today. The national accounts September quarter statements show that 80 per cent of the 1.3 million Australians who either lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero at the start of the pandemic are now back at work. Our economy is in comeback mode. Over the last five months, 650,000 jobs have been created. The participation rate is at 65.8 per cent, approaching its precrisis level. This is a real result for everyday Australians. This is what is making the difference to Australians families all around this country. It is no slogan to them. It is food on the table, it is opportunity for their kids, it is their job back and it is their purpose and their meaning. That's what's important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will take you directly to a family in my electorate of Ryan. There are families, business owners, mums and dads right across the country, including in the electorate of Ryan, who have been doing it tough. They are benefiting from what this Morrison government has delivered. There are 74,700 taxpayers in my electorate alone who are benefiting from tax cuts that have been delivered. Recently, I caught up with a local business in Ryan, The Single Guys Coffee Co. in Kenmore. It is a small family business. I caught up with local constituent Fiona, who had just been to the great 12RND gym next door, and we stopped to grab a coffee. She was determined to put the extra money that she had received from her tax cut back into her business, to employ new young people in our electorate of Ryan. It is stories like Fiona's that the Labor MPs are failing to grasp when they say these things haven't been delivered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Ryan there are 5,500 businesses that have been supported by JobKeeper. One local business owner, from Suburban Social in Chapel Hill, said it meant he could pay his staff. He said, 'Julian, it saved my bacon.' That's what Australians are saying about what the government has delivered. They've never said it about the Labor MPs opposite. They've never said that about a Labor government. It's because the Morrison government is delivering for all Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBAIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  One of the enduring images of our Black Summer is of the Prime Minister trying to force a pregnant woman to shake his hand during a fly-in visit to the fire ravaged town of Cobargo. It's a photo-op that the Prime Minister wants to forget, but the image says so much about the approach of those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leading up to the Eden-Monaro by-election in July, the Prime Minister and his ministers crisscrossed the electorate, promising to repair and heal our shattered communities and economies. With the cameras clicking away in June this year, the Prime Minister stood up and announced a round of funding for primary producers covering apple growers, forestry and wine producers. At the time, the Prime Minister made a big song and dance about the support the Liberals and Nationals would provide to primary producers in Eden-Monaro. It was a lifeline desperately needed—$86 million for the forestry industry, wine producers and apple growers, who were all hit by bushfires. It sounded great, but when the government lost the by-election, just two weeks later, all we heard was crickets from the Liberals and Nationals. It took months for the government to approach these industries about funding and, surprise, the dollars are still to hit the ground. With the cameras and the razzle-dazzle of the by-election gone, desperate communities have been left waiting, and it's cruel. The industries and businesses that the Prime Minister and the government promised immediate relief to have waited months for even the opportunity to apply for funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the middle of the by-election the Prime Minister was full of announcements, but bushfire communities have been forced to wait too long for any follow-through, and it's time the Prime Minister and his ministers heard it directly from these communities themselves. Go back to Cobargo, sit down with people there and ask them how they're doing. I'll happily take any of you there—the Prime Minister or any of those ministers—but don't turn up empty-handed like last time. Bring an open mind and a willingness to help people who so desperately need it. We have been calling for months for an extension to HomeBuilder for those in bushfire affected communities. The impact has been enormous. Finally, we have got an extension, but if they apply after 31 December they receive a lesser rate than other people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last four months I have clocked up 20,000 kilometres meeting with people, listening to their needs so that I can advocate for them in this very chamber. When I ask people how they are travelling, people from Tumbarumba to Kiah and from Cobargo to Bombay, they tell me the same thing—they feel abandoned. The whole nation heard it on Monday night during <span style="font-style:italic;">Q+A</span>. Graeme and Robyn Freedman travelled from their burnt-out block in Cobargo to tell Australia they feel abandoned by this government during one of the darkest chapters in Australian history. We just heard then they are facing two crises this year—the pandemic and the economic recovery. What about the bushfires? What happened to that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. Having witnessed the heartache of the last bushfire season, 750 people in my electorate alone lost their homes. The government have done nothing to prepare communities this year for the fire season. There is a $4 billion mitigation and recovery fund and $200 million per year available to communities across Australia for recovery and resilience. In the last two financial years nothing has been spent. That's $400 million that could have been spent on assisting our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bushfire royal commission suggests the way forward, but the Liberal-National government is ignoring one of the key recommendations and refusing to invest in a sovereign aerial firefighting fleet. Don't allow this royal commission to go the way of the 240 other inquiries and investigations into natural disasters. Black Summer happened on this government's watch. Delivering on the recommendations of the royal commission should be core business for this government. But instead communities are left unsure and are doubting the commitment of the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing has changed since last summer. While we wait for the government to do its job, people in my electorate feel abandoned. It is truly shameful, and I urge those opposite to get on with what the Australian public expects of them—meaningful delivery rather than just the same old photo op with no follow-up.</span>

It's almost as though the opposition has run out of ideas. Clearly they are not listening to what the rest of Australia is seeing and hearing—that is, that we are delivering.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Australians want us to deliver on the health and economic outcomes that the COVID crisis has delivered. Today we have seen from the Australian Bureau of Statistics a testament to the economic response that we have delivered to the most extraordinary economic crisis this country has seen in living memory. This data release showed that there was a GDP rise of 3.3 per cent in the September quarter, officially taking Australia out of a recession. This has largely been demand driven, and we know that the restrictions that have occurred in, unfortunately, Victoria have meant that that state is behind the rest of the country. But the recovery we've seen in the rest of the country is due to the cash boost we have delivered with regard to things like JobKeeper, which has supported 3.3 million workers; the HomeBuilder grant program, which has accelerated the construction sector; and the instant asset write-off, which has helped businesses have the confidence to invest in their own businesses. These measures have generated a demand led recovery, a recovery that puts us in a strong position to prepare for a post-COVID world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who comes from the health profession, I would like to list the many things that we have delivered with regard to our health response. We have acted swiftly to develop and fund a comprehensive health response—amongst other things, a $2.4 billion health package to protect and keep safe all Australians. We have ensured our health professionals are protected with adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. That has been an extraordinary delivery of an outcome which was, in a crisis, quite an unbelievable and unprecedented global supply chain difficulty. We secured COVID tests from overseas at a time when competition with this supply chain was incredibly stiff. These tests were delivered to states to enable them to do the contact tracing that was required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've provided $669 million to expand Medicare subsidised telehealth services for all Australians so everyone has access to quality health care while we've been living through COVID; we funded home delivery of most prescription medicines for those unable to get to their local pharmacy; we've delivered an extra $1 billion to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on aged care; and we've entered into advance purchasing arrangements with three vaccine manufacturers, with 134 million vaccines that are actually contracted. In addition to this, we've delivered $48 million to the National Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan. I could go on. There are 100 fever clinics. We've delivered expert advice and an evidence base with regard to committees. That has underpinned a very science based approach to what has been seen internationally as a wonderful response here in Australia, something that all Australians should be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn in my last minute to what we've delivered locally in Higgins. I'm very proud of the fact that we've delivered solar panels to St John's Anglican Church in Toorak and the Sri Venkata Krishna Brundavana temple in Murrumbeena. We've delivered for an exciting new biodiversity campaign run by the City of Stonnington. We're keeping our Jewish community safe with comprehensive security upgrades at the King David School in Armadale and at Chabad in Malvern. We've delivered for our sporting clubs, with projects approved, locked and loaded to commence first thing in 2021 now that restrictions in Victoria have finally been eased. These projects form part of a broad suite of ready-to-commence infrastructure projects across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The road to recovery has been long and bumpy, but the Morrison government has a firm hand on the wheel. Our economic comeback is now underway, and Australians should all be proud. The Morrison government has delivered for Australians on both an economic and a health front, and we will continue to do so now and into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  It gives me great pleasure—no, actually it doesn't give me great pleasure—to stand here and speak to this MPI. This MPI goes to this government's failures, and it gives me no pleasure to talk about a government's failures. This government has failed this country for seven successive years, and it is now in its eighth year of failing this country. Corruption, incompetence, cruelty—that's a trifecta that no government should be proud of, and this government has all three.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go to a few of these failures. The first is robodebt—heartless and illegal. A government was actually stealing the money of its own citizens. And who are those citizens? The poorest people in the country. The government didn't go to stockbrokers. It didn't go to day traders. It didn't go to the top end of town and steal their money; it stole the money of people who could least afford it. That's the tale of this government. The disaster of robodebt has this Prime Minister's fingerprints all over it from start to finish. This is not like the chicken coop in the photo opportunities; we can say for sure that we know that this Prime Minister built robodebt from the ground up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next is NBN. The government now admit after 7½ long years that Labor's NBN plan was the right one, after wasting billions and billions of dollars. That mistake is costing taxpayers billions to fix, and the opportunity cost is even higher. Businesses, educators and homeowners have had to put up with substandard broadband for years because of this government's rank incompetence at running an economy and running a country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next is Leppington Triangle. In the scheme of things, when we're talking about the trillion-dollar debt that we're now running into, I guess Leppington Triangle is small beer, but it is so emblematic of this government's manifest failures—a parcel of land bought from a Liberal donor for 1,000 per cent of what it was worth. They spent $30 million on a $3 million block of land. What's more, the seller got to keep the land. The Liberal donor gets to use the land for the next few years, virtually rent free.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no scandal that this government won't enter into. It is absolutely disgraceful. The budget is racking up $1 trillion of debt—one thousand billion dollars—with nothing to show for it. There is no plan for the future—no jobs plan, no infrastructure plan and no energy plan. We've had 22 energy plans under this government, and it hasn't landed a single one. They keep coming to the dispatch box and talking about lower power prices, yet power prices keep going up. After 7½ years of incompetent Liberal government, power prices are still going up. Home owners in Australia are still paying the price of a government that has rank incompetence, no ambition, no courage and no vision. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there is sports rorts: $100 million of taxpayers' money spent not because clubs had done the right thing and shown that they needed the money; this government put the money where it was in its own political best interests. Sports clubs did the right thing. They filled out the paperwork. They spent hours and hours filling out paperwork and meeting all the criteria, and it was all ignored, because in the Prime Minister's office he had coloured charts showing where to put the money based on the marginality of the seat. Corruption. This Prime Minister and his former minister are blocking every chance at genuine inquiry, as the Senate has just found. They're inquiring into this scandal, and the Prime Minister and former Minister McKenzie are blocking it. If they have nothing to hide, why won't they provide the evidence? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is holding people back, with 37,000 Australians stranded overseas. They've left behind aged-care residents, with nearly 700 dead because this government refused to come up with a COVID plan. Even before the pandemic, the royal commission damned this government's approach to aged care by titling their report <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. At every stage, this government fails. Corruption, cruelty, incompetence—it is not fit to govern and it deserves to go. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  The feigned indignation of those opposite—they're more than happy to use unparliamentary language and more than happy to cast aspersions about the leader of our nation. There's been one key theme through question time today, and it's the same theme that we've heard through this MPI where the Leader of the Opposition has been happy to lead the charge. That theme is that the Labor Party, for some reason, are deeply injured by the fact that there are photos of the Prime Minister. That's their key message today: there are too many photos of the Prime Minister. Here we are as a nation in the midst of a global pandemic. We are facing the greatest economic challenges our nation has faced since the Great Depression. We are in the midst of some challenging times with our largest trading partner. What does the opposition bring to parliament? The opposition brings to parliament a debate about whether there are too many photos of the Prime Minister. I don't know if it's jealousy and I don't know if it's pettiness, but I tell you what it's not: it is not the action of a party that is capable of governing. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the delivery of the Morrison government, it's always good to start with the outcomes. We saw some of the outcomes today through the national accounts for the September quarter. What they showed was a 3.3 per cent increase in GDP. That's the greatest lift in GDP growth since the 1970s. That's the outcome. There were 650,000 new jobs created over the last five months. That's the outcome. In addition, there were 700,000 jobs protected through JobKeeper. That's the outcome. Australia maintained its AAA credit rating. Three agencies confirmed the AAA credit rating. That's the outcome. That's the outcome of a strong government that is delivering. There is not one single person in this nation who is in ICU today due to COVID-19. That's due, again, to a good government that will deliver and to the Australian people, who are prepared to work together. That's what it's all about.</span>

The purpose of the amendments is to get the government not to cut the coronavirus supplement at this important time just as we are coming up to Christmas—when families are doing it tough and when many have lost their jobs and have no prospect of earning or of securing a job in the very near future—and at a time when the OECD today, in its economic outlook, warned the Morrison government that cuts to vital support in the economy will hamper Australia's recovery from the worst downturn that we've seen in a century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're hearing the speeches from the other side in this place and seeing them pat each other on the back. It's no way to go when they're withdrawing supplements for people who are going to be in dire straits, given that we are looking at thousands of job losses between now and Christmas and going into the new year. Instead of patting themselves on the back they should be hanging their heads in shame, because we are hurting the most vulnerable people. We now have an opportunity to increase that base rate for those people who don't have jobs, and we're missing the opportunity because of ideological politics from the government at this moment. Those people have been suffering, and will continue to suffer, for a long time. I would like to ask anyone in this place if they could live on $40 a day. You're obligated by Centrelink to look for work, go to interviews and apply for jobs. If you're doing that five times a day, think of the average transport costs and the average mobile costs to receive text messages and send emails. In fact, the $40 a day is hampering people getting jobs, because they cannot afford to take the transport and put food on the table. They don't have the economic ability to look for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill this government should have ensured that the base rate was increased. The member for Barton and everyone on this side have been calling for that. This was a missed opportunity. That's why Labor moved the amendment calling on the government to permanently increase the base rate of the JobSeeker payment. There are beneficial elements of the bill, notwithstanding the JobSeeker payment. We need to ensure that those people have a decent living like everyone else and they can put food on the table, pay their transport costs and pay their rent or mortgage and whatever else there is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government love talking about the support they have put in place. The reality is that, with the biggest economic downturn we've ever faced, they really haven't done much. Yes, they've plugged a few holes here and there, but we should go back and look at the worst economic downturn when we were in government—the global financial crisis. We immediately put money where it was needed—in infrastructure, projects and a whole range of things. Most importantly, we gave the most vulnerable people payments so that that money could turn the economy around. When you give someone on JobSeeker an extra $10, $20, $30, $40, or whatever it may be, that money will go straight into the economy. That money will be spent immediately, because that mum or dad who is unemployed and receiving that payment will need that extra $20 to buy school shoes for their children who will be starting school in January. If you give extra money to a millionaire, it will stay in their bank account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were to think of this logically, this is totally illogical in a period when the economy needs an injection. This is one way we could inject money into the economy. Those people have desperate needs. They have been doing it tough on very minimal payments—$40 a day. Every single cent gets spent on surviving. Anything above that, no matter how little or big, will go straight back into the economy. It's not rocket science. I cannot understand this. With this legislation we've missed an opportunity to increase the base rate; assist those people, which is the humane thing to do; and help the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not cut the coronavirus supplement, especially now at Christmas. This government should have delivered a permanent increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker payment. Everyone would have benefited from that—the people who need it the most, our retailers and a whole range of other people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of the pandemic the government introduced the coronavirus supplement of $550 a fortnight. It was an additional payment for those receiving unemployment support as well as for single parents and students. We supported this additional payment, which was urgently needed, not just because of the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic but because the unemployment payment is so low. Everyone—from church groups to volunteer groups who assist people who are doing it tough—continually comes to see me in my electorate office and tell me that we must increase it. How can people live on those payments?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The OECD figures that came out have confirmed the expectation that unemployment will remain above prepandemic levels until at least 2022. That's what we know of, but it could go on longer. We have the government come in here patting themselves on the back and saying how great they are, but we know it's only going to get worse and be worse for those people. They are going to feel the hardship and pain of knowing that they have no prospect of receiving a job. All you have to do is look at my own home state where people have lost their jobs. Some of the people I talk to are in their late 40s, early 50s or up to 60. They have absolutely no prospect of finding work in these economic times. We should be thinking about those people and ensuring that we assist them, and the way to do it is by increasing that base rate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Approximately 160,000 Australians are expected to lose their jobs by the end of the year. We know that 1.8 million Australians are expected to be relying on unemployment support by Christmas. We've missed the opportunity to deliver certainty for Australians doing it tough by delivering that permanent increase. We know there are seven applicants for each job vacancy. There are simply not enough jobs. I would personally pat the government on the back if it was creating jobs for these people, but it's not. The statistics are black and white. It tells you that for every position vacant there are seven people—let alone if your skills aren't right up to date, up to scratch, let alone if you've been working, for example, in manufacturing most of your life and you're a bloke or woman in your 40s or 50s, let alone if you work in a cafe and that's been shut down because of coronavirus or in the services industry that's really doing it tough. I speak to restaurateurs regularly. Many of them are not eligible for JobKeeper, so many of their staff have gone onto JobSeeker. Those people have no prospect of employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to tell government members: get out there and talk to some of these workplaces. They'll tell you exactly what's going on. Unfortunately, what we see in this place is a government that is patting itself on the back, continuously spruiking something that is not happening. What is happening is that unemployment will not go down. The OECD figures show that this will go into 2022 and could even get worse, and we don't know what's going to happen after 2022. We know that they want to reduce the rate, which will make it tougher for those people, and they're not taking the opportunity to inject some extra money into the economy by increasing that base rate. If you give someone who's trying to survive on $40 a day an extra $10, $20, $30 or whatever it may be, that money goes straight back into the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very saddened by this move, by the government, because they always seem to want to attack the vulnerable, the ones who are doing it tough, the ones who, for whatever reason, have fallen through the net or the ones who weren't privileged or the ones who, for no matter what reason, are doing it so tough. They're the ones we should be thinking of. They're the people we should be looking after, and they're the people we have a duty to look after, because you as a government and we as an opposition haven't been able to provide the positions and the jobs for those people to work. We haven't been able to provide the climate to ensure that people can get jobs and work. I'm sure that if you speak to any unemployed person and give them the option of earning the base wage per week or being on $40 a day, I know what that answer will be. It'll be: 'We want to work.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, instead of patting yourselves on the back, create some jobs, put some money into the economy and increase the base rate—and then we'll all pat you on the back. I support the amendments by the member for Barton. Really, it's a sad day if this bill gets through the way it is.</span>

The temporary power will be available until 31 March 2021 and until 16 April 2021 for the nil-rate period. The current powers in social security law that enable the minister to set the rate and duration of the coronavirus supplement and the related exemptions from the waiting and preclusion periods will remain in place until 31 March 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together these powers will enable the minister to determine the rate of coronavirus supplement and the cohorts it is paid to; the personal income test for recipients of JobSeeker payment, excluding single principal carer recipients, and youth allowance (other); the partner income test for JobSeeker payment recipients only; eligibility criteria for JobSeeker payment and youth allowance (other); the waiver of certain waiting periods; the waiver of the 104-week qualifying residence period for parenting payment; the period in which income support recipients can maintain eligibility for payment and retain their concession card while receiving a nil rate of payment due to employment income; the period self-declarations could continue to be used for a member of a couple assessments with a modified test for JobSeeker payment; pension portability arrangements; and extensions to mobility allowance two- and 12-week grace periods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces a new discretionary power under the social security and veterans' entitlements assets tests to extend the principal home temporary absence provisions. This will prevent the inclusion of the principal home in the assets test while a person is unable to return to Australia within the allowable absence period due to circumstances beyond their control.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill permanently repeals the temporary exemptions from the liquid assets test waiting period and assets tests which were in place in the early stages of the government's economic response but are now no longer needed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill clarifies that after 28 March 2021 Services Australia and the Department of Social Services will be able to continue to use information captured by the Australian Taxation Office in relation to the JobKeeper measure for planning, policy development and compliance purposes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislative framework in this bill will allow the government to extend temporary measures in the income support system to provide additional support to Australians impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The instrument-making power will deliver the policies at a cost of $3.2 billion to 2024-25. I commend this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will do three things: stop the government's planned cuts to the coronavirus supplement at Christmas; require the government to help pensioners, including those on the DSP and carer payment, with the extra costs of the pandemic; and require the government to announce a permanent increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker Payment. We have had this debate in Australia for a long time. Now is the time for a permanent increase to unemployment support. It should be done, and this year it has been shown that it can be done. Why won't the government do the right thing? The reasons for a permanent increase are so compelling and so simple, and there are many on that side that agree with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Poverty is a real issue. It's a trap that prevents people from getting work, particularly older people. Because of poverty they can't get the right clothes. It takes the car off the road and it impacts on children and their education. Poverty doesn't allow for the cost of renting somewhere safe or leaving family violence. We should not have poverty in a country like Australia; I'm sure everyone in this place would agree with that statement. But it will take more than words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said earlier today that, for the vast bulk of people who want a job right now, there aren't jobs available. There are some but the available jobs are dwarfed by the number of people who really want them. The people on unemployment payments spend pretty much everything they get. They simply have to. This is good for local businesses and jobs, especially in retail. The timing of the latest coronavirus supplement reduction from $250 per fortnight to $150 per fortnight gives this away. Christmas and the new year are difficult and expensive times for families. Support should not be cut and certainly not right at the time when families are already under the greatest pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a reasonable and modest amendment. It gives the government the flexibility they need to set a rate and structure payments, taking into account expert advice, the budget position and the labour market. This is not a test; it is a genuine attempt to encourage and support a reasonable and timely increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker payment. I really hope the government considers it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will remove the government's drop-dead date of 31 March 2021 for the rate of unemployment payments to return to the old Newstart rate. Going back to $40 a day is something that so many people have told me is striking fear into their hearts. They are already planning for it, already shuffling bills, already working out where to go when they can no longer afford the flat they have been sharing for the last six months because the coronavirus supplement has helped them afford stable housing and already working out what medical and dental appointments to skip and what school, sport and other activities they will have to tell their kids they simply can't participate in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the government has the power under the Social Security Act to keep paying the coronavirus supplement as long as there is the impact of the pandemic. Families will be carrying the economic scars of this recession for years. The Department of Social Services expects the number of people relying on unemployment support to remain elevated across the entire forward estimates and for some time to come. In this context, I simply cannot understand why the government is so keen to take away this power, which can only be used to help people by continuing the coronavirus supplement. Of course no-one can force the minister's hand, and the existence of this power does not guarantee that the government won't stick to their current policy of cutting unemployment payments all the way back down to the old Newstart rate in March. But at least this amendment would still keep that option available to the government, and there is no reason for the government to oppose these changes. I have written to the minister. I have spoken with the minister and asked her to seriously consider this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year the government thought it was a good idea for this power to last until the impact of the pandemic had faded, but now they want to repeal it early. Nothing has changed except perhaps that hearts have hardened. There is nothing that anyone but the government can do to increase payments—that is the reality of the parliament. Only the government can move bills to make amendments that increase expenditure, and the government, by definition, has the numbers in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many opposite who have acknowledged that the old base rate of Newstart is too low, including the member for New England; the member for Cowper, who said that going back to $40 a day was cruel and unusual punishment; Senator Canavan in the other place; Senator Dean Smith; the member for Monash; and the member for Fisher. I ask those opposite a simple question: if you know that this needs to change, why won't you support this amendment, which will at least hold open a glimmer of hope that the rate of unemployment payments won't go all the way back down to $40 a day in March? This section doesn't need to be in this bill. If it were removed, the beneficial elements of what is proposed here, like the extension of the more generous partner income test, would still be able to go ahead.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment proposes to permanently strike out the minister's ability to exempt people from the liquid assets waiting period. This amendment will remove this part of the bill so that exemptions can still be made. Labor has consistently opposed the reintroduction of the liquid assets waiting period in the midst of a pandemic. The government should not have reinstated the 13-week liquid assets waiting period in September. Most Australians are shocked to find out that, with as little as $5,000 in the bank, people have to wait to receive unemployment support. It's very noisy in here.</span>

                    </a>  The Prime Minister should drop his cruel plan to make people wait 26 weeks to get unemployment support if they have modest savings. This false economy means people are forced to run down to their last dollar and makes it more likely they will face hardship, like struggling to pay their mortgage or keeping a car on the road. It also means people are more likely to need to rely on other services like food banks and emergency relief. If people have no buffer at all, it means they can't meet medical bills, they can't keep up with the mortgage while they look for work and they can't afford to move. This has a huge impact on relationships and on mental health. That is what this parliament should really be focused on—people, and helping them get through the tough times before the pandemic does finally subside. It should not be our role to make matters worse when people are already facing a dark hour.</span>

I hope those opposite will have the courage and the sense to support this amendment, which will allow people who have built up a modest buffer to keep some control and some dignity when they face unemployment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As soon as practicable after this section commences, the Minister must consider whether the period for which a determination can be in force under section 1263 should be extended to allow determinations to be made for as long as the impacts from COVID-19 continue to exist.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Example: This could allow for the continuation, after 31 March 2021, of the extended partner income test, $300 income free areas and eligibility rules for people who are self-employed or sole traders.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment would require the minister to consider extending beneficial changes like the increased partner income test beyond 31 March 2021. Earlier in the year, at the beginning of the pandemic, Labor negotiated a general regulation-making power with the government so that additional assistance could be given to people who need it during the pandemic, and it's lucky we did, because it has been used to pay students and apprentices the coronavirus supplement. It's been used to double the partner income test to around $80,000 to help households where one income earner has lost a job; this is around 100,000 households. It has been used to increase the amount a person can earn each fortnight before their payment starts tapering out from $106 to $300. It has been used to make it easier for sole traders and self-employed people to access support. Just like the increased payments themselves, these changes will need to continue long after March. There are millions of households who will be hurting for years to come. We realise that this is a broad power, and this amendment requests that the government come back to parliament with primary legislation to make it a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this bill overall, so the coronavirus supplement can continue to be paid, Labor wants to strike out the part that will take payments all the way back to the old Newstart rate. In relation to this bill, we want the government to extend other beneficial changes beyond March 2021, but we know that, even if the government have the continuing power to pay the coronavirus supplement, they will do so only if they want to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make two final points. With that in mind, we will not stand in the way of this bill, because we do not want students, the self-employed and those benefiting from the partner income test to be worse off after December. That is a very important reason. Ultimately, the government should just do the right thing and announce a permanent increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker payment. It would put so many people's minds at ease, and it would save jobs.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  Throughout what has been a very difficult 2020, those of us on this side of the chamber have not allowed the perfect to be the enemy of the good. We have been prepared to be constructive. We have put forward ideas to improve legislation in areas like JobKeeper and wage subsidies. We advanced it, even when those opposite in leadership positions were saying that was a bad idea. The shadow minister has just indicated that we will not stand in the way of this legislation, consistent with that. But we have put forward constructive amendments. I say to the government: come to the table in the spirit in which the opposition has put that forward. It is one thing to be the 'no-alition' when you were in opposition and say no to everything, as you did during the global financial crisis. It's another thing now, when you are the government and you have the responsibility to look after people during this crisis, to say no to constructive suggestions which have been put forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three essential principles have been advanced by the shadow minister here. One of them is to call for a permanent increase in the unemployment rate—what we used to call Newstart and now call JobSeeker. If those opposite have acknowledged that $40 a day is not enough to live on and, indeed, they doubled the payments in an act that resulted in more money flowing around the economy—which resulted in improving people's lives and, literally, for some people, meant the difference between having three meals a day and what they used to have to do—then surely we are in a position to provide certainty to those people. Those opposite often speak, quite rightly, about the mental health impact of this crisis. There's no question that that is real. There's no question that there's a genuineness about the need to act on those issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea, as you are saying to people, that in March that rate will go to $40 a day is having an impact. It's having an impact right now. We have one more week of sitting before we adjourn for the Christmas period. To say to those people, as they head into Christmas, 'We are going to put you back into poverty; we are going to go to a rate which, when confronted with the reality, we recognised was not on,' is not good enough. We have given the government the space, as well, by not advocating a particular figure. That was designed very explicitly—we say that upfront, and we've got some criticism because of it—to give you the space to make a change that makes a difference to people's lives and that we would hopefully be in a position to back in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For you to vote against that amendment is an outrage, but it's not the worst thing that you're doing here today. To reintroduce the liquid assets waiting period, during a period in which unemployment is going up and during a period in which we know, as government support from the economy is withdrawn, you're relying upon increased expenditure and confidence in the economy, is bad economic policy and also has a bad social policy impact. Reintroducing the liquid assets waiting period now is having a particularly draconian impact in two areas, and you need to think about this. Firstly, to those people who, encouraged by this government, drew down their super because they needed liquid assets—in a way that will not only hurt future governments' fiscal positions but will hurt people's retirement incomes—you're now going to say that they need to spend all that money before you will give them eligibility, by reintroducing the liquid assets waiting period. It's quite extraordinary. You're effectively doing this, and be clear about this: person A, who did not withdraw $10,000 from their super, will be eligible for support payments, but person B, who did withdraw $10,000 from their super, will miss out. That is what you are doing here. Think about it. Think about it and act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted)</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area is in redundancy payments. A range of people have lost their jobs. We all know that. Don't come in here and say, 'That's bad but, by the way, what we're going to do here is reintroduce the liquid assets waiting period so that those people who've lost their jobs and have a redundancy payment will then miss out as well.' It's just extraordinary you would not support these amendments that are put forward in faith. There's nothing radical about the propositions put forward by the shadow minister, my colleague, the member for Barton. These are sensible amendments to improve your legislation—your legislation that we are not threatening to hold up, your legislation that will be improved. By the way, you can like other things and take the credit for it. It's a bit like wage subsidies and JobKeeper. I'll give you the big hint. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third area of amendments—and think about this that you're voting against with your amendment here—is that we are moving an amendment to retain the ministerial power of the Treasurer of Australia to be able to adjust the coronavirus supplement. Think about that. We are trying to give the Treasurer the power—while the coronavirus supplement is in, it will remain Josh Frydenberg, unless he's pushed aside in the reshuffle that's coming—to adjust the supplement if you have got it wrong, if you shouldn't decrease the supplement come next March. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are sensible amendments. They're practical amendments. They'll make a difference to people's lives. But they'll also improve the economic outlook by increasing the funds that are flowing around the economy. That is the whole point of economic stimulus when you have a recession: you increase the money that flows around the economy, and you increase it at the lower end because people spend it and don't save it. What you are doing in opposing this is sheer arrogance, and you should reconsider your position. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be pursuing these amendments in the Senate as well. If you want to save face, and not come up with some common sense here, then for goodness sake—so many of the things that we have advanced during this difficult year of 2020 have been adopted by the government. When they have we've welcomed them, like JobKeeper. We've welcomed wage subsidies. We've welcomed the increased support for mental health. We've welcomed a range of the initiatives that have been done. But they just say, 'No, we've got this all right. We're geniuses. We know what's going on. We don't need any help.' That's what parliament's for, to improve legislation. That's why we have a process of consideration in detail. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Had the opposition acted like the coalition acted in opposition during the GFC, I might have thought, 'Oh, well, it's an either/or proposition.' Instead, we have the childish position of those opposite not being prepared to engage in serious policies and suggestions that are put forward here. I would just say to you: have a bit of common sense and think about what we're putting forward here, by the member for Barton, in good faith. We'll continue to vote for our amendments that have been put forward, but we'll vote for the legislation. I think this parliament, in some cases this year, has acted with a great deal of maturity and we've got better outcomes because of it. But this is not a fine moment, when you have an amendment before you now to give your Treasurer more power to adjust payments, if you vote against this. That is just sheer arrogance, hubris and bloody-mindedness. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="133646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  Today in this parliament, in the legislation on the extension of the coronavirus supplement that we debated before question time, during question time and just before I rose to speak, we saw this government reveal its true, heartless colours. We saw this government once and for all put paid to its marketing slogan that it's leaving no Australians behind. If those opposite ever again try to stand up and say that they're the ones who are making sure that Australians can get through this time of COVID and the recession, they will have egg all over their faces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we saw the government strip from its own minister the power to increase Newstart from March next year. We saw the government say: 'Sorry, everyone that we've been telling how great our initiatives are and how wonderful we are because we've helped people live above the poverty line during COVID, because we're going to just stop doing that in March. We don't care that the Reserve Bank governor has said that it's going to be a lumpy and bumpy recovery. We don't care that Victorians are still struggling.' They don't care that in communities like my community of Dunkley unemployment has doubled this year, that there are more than 10,000 people getting JobSeeker and that more than a thousand young people getting youth allowance. This government today said: 'We don't care about any of you. We don't care that the prospects of getting a job between now and the end of March are pretty slim. It's okay, though, because we've got a slogan called JobMaker.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst thing about all of this today, and the votes that we've just had, is that we know there are members of the government who voted against what they believe in. We know that there are members of the government who have said publicly that they think that Newstart has to be above the base rate of $40 a day. We know that there are Nationals that go home to their electorates and say: 'We're the ones that represent the poorest people in Australia. We're the ones that stand up for the unemployed.' But today they voted for those people who don't have a job to go back to an unemployment benefit at a base rate of $40 a day. They stand up and say: 'Oh, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong to say $40 a day. You're all lying, all you Labor people, because there are all these extra supplements.' Go and talk to an unemployed person about what it's like to try to live on the base rate of $40 a day, on unemployment benefits which are below the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we saw that happen. We also had one of the most unedifying spectacles in question time that anyone could imagine. I was ashamed to be sitting in this chamber today watching the Minister for Government Services not answering questions about robodebt and showing utter contempt for this parliament, for the rulings of the Speaker and, most importantly, for the people of Australia. There was no sense of taking responsibility and no remorse for the people whose lives have been damaged and have ended because of an unlawful scheme of averaging income to issue debt notices to people, which they had to prove were wrong and which were sometimes seven or more years in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that people have taken their lives. And we had to sit here in question time today and hear a minister refuse to answer questions and try to say, 'Oh, well, you know, there's this press release from 25 years ago that means: if someone said they were going to do something similar in the past, don't blame me for doing it now.' Surely everyone was told by their mum, 'When you're caught doing something wrong, don't say, "But they did it first!"' Seriously! We're not children; we're elected representatives to the federal parliament, entrusted with the privilege of looking after people who need our help. And that's what we got in question time today. The minister should be ashamed of himself, anyone who supports his behaviour should be ashamed of themselves and all of those ministers in the government that were part of implementing robodebt and telling Australians that if they didn't pay back an unlawful debt they would go to jail should be ashamed of themselves. In any other government, in any other Westminster system around the world, ministers would take responsibility and governments would fall over that. But not this government. They want to strip away supplements and put people back on $40 a day at a time when they need supplements the most. They won't take responsibility for robodebt. Apparently it's okay to spend $1.2 billion worth of taxpayers' money on something that you didn't do and you're not responsible for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this legislation that I'm speaking on today: the government want to introduce a mandated, racist scheme on Australia's First Nations people. Today in this parliament we have witnessed the true colours of this government, the ideological nastiness upon which they are based and the cowardliness of those who don't agree with it in not crossing the floor and voting against it. This legislation is racist legislation. It will impact 34,000 people in Australia, 23,000 of whom are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. More than 18,000 are in the Northern Territory. Sixty-eight per cent of people who will be forced—and that's an important word, 'forced'—onto the cashless debit card are First Nations Australians. Reasonable people would think: 'Well, it must be because this will work. It must be because the government has seen what's happened with the pilots, with the trial, and has said: "This scheme is something that is making people's lives better. This scheme is something that is helping people to get into employment, that is helping people to deal with mental health or alcohol or drug issues that they have. This scheme is helping people, and the people are grateful for the help."'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what you would expect would happen before such a drastic and draconian policy telling people that they can't spend cash and they can't choose how to live their lives would be implemented. That's what you would think. That's what I would think. But that's not the case. It's the opposite. The Auditor-General's report from 2018 demonstrated that the government had failed to show that broad-based compulsory income management works. This government asked the University of Adelaide to engage in an evaluation of the trial sites following a botched trial in 2018. This evaluation cost $2½ million—$2½ million which would have made a big difference in a lot of electorates, including mine. You'd also expect the government to pay some attention to that evaluation that they paid $2½ million for. Again, no. It's the opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation was introduced into this parliament before that report was finished, before the minister read the evaluation. At estimates, the minister revealed she still hadn't read the report, and the Minister for Indigenous Australians said he did not need to see the report to support making the trials permanent. I guess he doesn't need to listen to the evidence that has been given by Indigenous people, by First Nations organisations for those who have lived with the cashless welfare card to make the decision. If he had and if they had read the report, we wouldn't be standing here today trying to stop this government from implementing a racist policy. They're implementing it on First Nations people, not with First Nations people, not at the request of First Nations people from Ceduna, Goldfields, East Kimberley, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, the whole of the Northern Territory; they're implementing it on them and to them regardless of what they say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this sort of program can work; income management can work. It needs the community to be part of it. It doesn't work when you force it on people. In some situations where child protection is involved, it can work. In communities that have said, 'We want to do this and we want to work with it,' it can work. But that's not how this government is approaching this issue. They are saying, 'You will do this because we know better.' That's what this government is saying to First Nations people across Australia. To the 68 per cent of people who will be subjected to the cashless welfare card under this legislation and who are First Nations people, they are saying, 'We will tell you how to live your lives because we know better than you do.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 12 February this year, the Prime Minister introduced his new Closing the Gap targets. People will recall that. It was a big moment. He talked about it quite a lot in the media. There was a lot of attention on it. This is what the Prime Minister told this parliament, this chamber, when he introduced the targets:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What I know is that to rob a person of their right to take responsibility for themselves, to strip them of responsibility and capability to direct their own futures, to make them dependent, is to deny them their liberty, and slowly that person will wither before your eyes. That's what we did to our First Nations peoples, and, mostly, we didn't even know we were doing it. We thought we were helping when we replaced independence with welfare. This must change. We must restore the right to take responsibility, the right to make decisions …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the Prime Minister told this chamber in February of this year, and now with this legislation the Prime Minister and his government are doing the exact opposite. What is the definition of 'hypocrisy'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the definition of 'hubris'? What is the definition of 'knowing better than everyone else'? How can the Prime Minister and the Minister for Indigenous Australians come into this parliament and say that they will, for the first time ever in the history of Australia, take an attitude of working with Indigenous Australians, with First Nations Australians, and not do things to them, and then bring in this legislation in NAIDOC Week, no less—last week—which does things to First Nations people? It's breathtaking! But it's just the third thing this government has done today to say to vulnerable Australians, to Australians that look to the government for support and assistance, 'We know better than you.' And they don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't, in this country, have people who are living in poverty. We shouldn't, in this country, have First Nations people whose living standards are a shame and a blight on our country. We are, as everyone says, a generous people. We are a prosperous country. We have people in this parliament who are good people, on both sides of the chamber, who want to be part of First Nations people designing and implementing programs that assist their future, yet we are being asked to talk to and vote on legislation that takes away autonomy and goes right back to saying, 'We know better than you do.' And worse than that, it says: 'Thanks so much for telling us about your experience. Thanks so much for telling us that this doesn't work. Thanks so much for coming, giving us your time and your experience and your wisdom about what it is you want for your communities, but shut up now, because we know better.' I won't be part of it, and I tell you what: I won't be part of this legislation being the stalking horse for a cashless welfare card going across the country applying to everyone, and neither will my colleagues on this side of the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I'm rising today to speak on this legislation to outline my concerns surrounding the program and the potential implications of making it permanent. I welcome this opportunity to detail why I think it is not the best way forward. To be clear, I'm not at all seeking to condemn those who want this program in their communities. They are not in any way without empathy or care, and indeed I know them to be good and decent and caring people, and I do believe that they want the very best for their communities and to see individuals thrive. There are also community leaders who do support this program for the same reasons. But I note, from the recent research, that there are others over the years since the rollout who have backed away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I can see there are measures in this bill which are an attempt to address the stigma that surrounds individuals in this program, these measures miss the point. Stigma is not just external or how our society perceives someone. In all the conversations that surround stigma, we fail to recognise the internal or felt stigma that people experience, making them feel other and less than due to their circumstance. Despite the proposed changes, so much damage has already been done, with many recipients reporting separate lines in supermarkets or an inability to shop at some stores at all, as referenced in the recent Senate report. If that doesn't make you uncomfortable, it should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are countless reasons why someone may need government assistance. Certainly, after such a tumultuous and difficult year, many Australians are sadly experiencing for the first time what it means to be without work. Our government has responded accordingly, with appropriate measures that are temporary, targeted and scalable. This program could and should have the same approach, perhaps utilising the card as a temporary tool, targeted towards people who have demonstrated that they need assistance on a fixed time basis with the appropriate support to transition. Applying a broad brush to all recipients in the current sites, no matter their circumstances, is harmful and unhelpful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a high level of anxiety that exists elsewhere in the country beyond the three trial sites. In the northern Tasmanian community that I proudly represent, I've had distressed people, including pensioners, ask me if they will end up having their income managed. And with the amount of time and money spent in addressing the current challenges of this program, it is difficult to believe that this program will end with these current sites. No matter your circumstance, relying on government assistance is difficult not only financially but mentally and emotionally. I have been a recipient of government assistance at different times in my life and I can understand the distress that so many forced on to this card would feel. This system of income management strips away autonomy and a sense of pride, no matter how well intentioned. Government imposing control in this way is not a fix to the myriad of issues driving disadvantage and at best it is a bandaid. Whenever you approach a human problem by inciting shame and guilt, you have already lost those that you are seeking to help. The rhetoric that surrounds social security and systems like income management plays in to the very worst of human nature; we're essentially inviting people to look at their fellow Australians as something 'other' or 'less than'. That's not the Australia I want to live in. I'm standing here as I believe in an egalitarian society and equality of opportunity, and dividing our society into us and them is not the Australia we should aspire to. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have a fundamental problem with how this program and this legislation aligns with my own principles. As a Liberal, I believe in personal and individual responsibility. It's the very foundation of our core principles. We work towards a lean government that minimises interference in our daily lives. Forcing the cashless debit card program on to people unless, or until, they can prove to the government that they can manage their own finances is antithetical to these principles. Do these principles only apply if you're not poor? I believe we're better than that. It should be pointed out mutual obligation measures are already in place for those needing government assistance and it's appreciated that a range of such measures is expected. However, the level of intrusion imposed upon recipients of this program is overreaching.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card program is a punitive measure enacted on the presumption all welfare recipients within the trial areas are incapable of managing their finances and require the government's assistance. I acknowledge that some communities are more likely to experience generational disadvantage and have generally poorer outcomes in a number of areas. These are all good reasons for the government to provide assistance to address these problems. However, it is not clear to me that the cashless debit card program is the best solution or even a good solution to address some of these systemic issues. Of course we should be looking to address the substantial challenges of intergenerational disadvantage and we shouldn't shy away from that, but I don't believe that this is the way. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just doing stuff to our communities is not the same as helping. You will always get better results when you empower people to do things for themselves. If we truly want to move the dial on intergenerational disadvantage, we need to address complex issues like trauma and put in place a range of effective, evidence based programs that work to address the issues that keep communities in poverty. It's claimed the cashless debit card program is delivering significant benefits in the communities in which the trial has operated. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Cashless debit card trial evaluation: final evaluation report</span> indicates that those benefits are limited in nature and scope and do not demonstrate an overall improvement in the conditions which the program is intending to address. I do acknowledge that the report found some reductions in the consumption of alcohol, illegal drug use and participation in gambling by program participants, but it's not clear whether the program delivers meaningful change in the long term or just controls behaviour in the immediate sense. There is just not enough evidence that supports the view that this program is a game-changer for these communities and the individuals placed on it to justify the associated harm that it causes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The program has also been presented as a solution to many issues. However, it casts a wide net that, in my view, punishes recipients as a collective rather than having regard for individual circumstances. It places the burden of demonstrating the ability to manage your finances on the individual, thereby making the default assumption that recipients are incapable of managing their finances. This only serves to stigmatise and marginalise recipients and doesn't fundamentally address the wider issues. In doing so, it also drives assumptions that addiction, gambling and domestic violence only occur in disadvantaged communities. We know this is untrue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of trialling the cashless welfare program has amounted to more than $80 million since 2015. It's somewhat ironic to me that you can essentially have an income management assessment trial for half a decade that can't show conclusive results and yet there are a number of evidence based programs that cost far less and that have demonstrably worked—programs like Healthy George Town, which was rolled out in my home town, an area recognised for high rates of disadvantage and where I served as mayor. Together with Lucy and Penny from Healthy Tasmania, we fought for a minute amount of funding—$150,000 for 10 years. I was thrilled when the federal government funded the program last year. In less than 12 months, this program has delivered over 1,000 hours of healthy lifestyle activities to hundreds of locals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Healthy Tasmania team has also rolled out the Healthy Quit program to eight participants, with three quitting smoking entirely and all significantly reducing the number of cigarettes smoked per day. In just seven weeks, participants saved over $2,000. The same group has also rolled out Healthy Shed initiatives at a local men's shed, with a focus on improving the overall health of participants. Of those participants, 100 per cent said the program made them more confident to manage their own health and 50 per cent said that by the end of the program they were feeling less depressed as a result of their involvement. Of course these programs are not a magic fix to the systemic issues that exist in areas where there's significant disadvantage, but it is evidence based programs like these that play a critical role in addressing the issues that can keep individuals from being active participants in their own lives. Implementing a range of programs and initiatives to support communities where disadvantage exists can make a difference and probably at a fraction of the cost. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it extremely disappointing and frustrating that we would look to support income-management systems like this while not addressing the reprehensible practices of payday lenders. We are seeking to manage people's income on the one hand while, on the other hand, allowing highly predatory payday lenders direct access to our most vulnerable. This is a complete contradiction and a damaging one at that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must move to investing in long-term solutions that create sustainable and meaningful change. The very concept of this type of control of our communities is anathema to me. The immediate challenge that we have is: what's the alternative for these trial communities right now? With just a few weeks of the year left, there is a great deal of uncertainty for those who have been on this program for a very long time. There are not alternative payment structures in place, so to just stop it in its tracks will potentially cause further disadvantage. After such a long trial phase, it would require some work to transition away from it again. I will continue to advocate for that to occur, and it's the only reason I'm not voting against this bill today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech, I stated that I want to be a genuine, authentic representative for my northern Tasmanian community and that I would fight for better outcomes for every single person I represent. This type of program will never be accepted in my community, and I want to make it unequivocally clear today that any proposed future expansion of this scheme will not have my support.</span>

We're all standing here, one after the other today, as we have done repeatedly, speaking about the cashless debit card in various forms of legislation across the last few years as it has gone from a supposed trial, where communities have been consulted and have agreed to be part of it, to something much, much more draconian. And we are always individually trying to capture, I think it's fair to say, what the member for Bass just captured so beautifully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Bass, I have been a recipient of the support systems in this country. As a single mother with three children who worked part-time for a period of six years, I was a single mother in receipt of support from the Commonwealth. I completely understand the comments that she made about the shame, about the stigma, about how it feels to stand in a Centrelink queue and about how it feels to have people look at you as if you are somehow or other different than others. I would put on the record something that I think sums up that feeling. I think it's legitimate here, although we have to contextualise that. We live in a large country, and we southerners have not had a cashless debit card placed on us.</span>

                    </a>  Exactly—yet, as the member for Bruce says. But, on this side of the chamber—and so refreshingly from Tasmania—the member for Bass joins us in seeing what is happening in the north and questioning its validity and, most importantly, questioning the stigmatising aspects it has on the populations that it is put upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My story goes like this. As a single mother, paying a mortgage, working part-time, with three kids, teaching 0.6 and doing my load across four days—because I really wanted to teach year 12; I didn't want to work three, because that would have precluded me—I was a recipient of welfare. I distinctly remember that I was going to paint the inside of my house. A kindly neighbour who is a great friend said to me: 'I'll help you do that, Jo. I'll help you paint the house.' And he relayed to me that, in another conversation, another friend of a friend had said to him: 'Why are you helping Joanne paint the house? It's not her house. She's a single mum.' And when I spoke to that person and pushed him, he said, 'I think it's a bit rich that you're getting taxpayer dollars and you're paying a mortgage.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take it in, folks. The things we say in this place and the rhetoric we use has impacts in the suburbs and in our communities in terms of the assumptions and the things that we suggest about people. And this legislation is one of the worst examples of that that I have seen, not just in my seven years in this parliament but in my time on this planet. It makes me ashamed to be Australian that we're even discussing this—that we are prepared to have a discriminatory piece of legislation that discriminates in geography and discriminates in race. And there is no way around this. The communities where this is targeted know that. The rest of Australia knows it. You only need to talk to a pensioner who hears about the government's working group to understand that they know what it means, because they say to me, 'So we're going to be discriminated against, too.' They know who's being discriminated against, and they know what it means. So I stand here today thrilled that the member for Bass has the courage through her convictions and her life experience to stand up for her community and, in doing so, to stand up for every community across this nation to say that supporting someone and helping someone is not about taking their choices away.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all read the reports, we've all read the reviews and we've all read the assessment from the University of Adelaide. We know that this system is completely and utterly flawed. We know that it's rolled out with one hand to control someone's spending under the guise of saying, 'You shouldn't be spending money on alcohol, you shouldn't be spending money on cigarettes and you shouldn't be spending money on illicit drugs.'</span>

                    </a>  There are laws to stop people spending money on illicit drugs, and the member just said 'Hear, hear!' Sorry, I drink, and so do most Australians. It's not illegal in this country. I'm sorry; I come from a community with lots of low-socioeconomic people who drink and smoke, perhaps too much. We in this place are not in a position to hold ourselves above the people we represent, and that's exactly what this piece of legislation does. It says, 'We are better than you.' It says: 'It's legal to drink alcohol and it's legal to smoke cigarettes, but not if you live in certain parts of the country and not if you're of a certain ethnicity. Then it's the wrong thing for you to do.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to say that what the member for Bass had to say was so refreshing, because I've been here for seven years in which I've listened to those opposite on speak on bills related to the cashless debit card on more than one occasion and have left this chamber disgusted. An absolute fundamental understanding of poverty and what it's like to live in chaos is lacking over there. We've got teachers all over this country. We are trained in this. It's a really simple thing. We go into classrooms to work with kids who may have come from a chaotic home that morning, and, right now, with the recession, some of those homes that have been stable will be, at this point in time, chaotic. People will put bills on top of the fridge hoping they'll fall down the back so they don't have to think about paying them and wonder about how they're going to pay to get the hole in the roof fixed. Sound familiar? Where does this come from? Where's the worst case for housing in this country? That'd be in remote communities. Where do we know that these things are happening intensely? In remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you do not understand this lived experience of living in poverty, if you do not understand what it's like to not know where next week's income is going to come from and if you think that putting something in place to control someone's spending is going to fix that then you're mad. This is a government that cut funding for financial advice from people in my community. They could go and get a financial adviser to assist them to do their budget across the next six months so that they could get some relief from the stress of poverty and get their heads above water so that every night they weren't feeling so crushed, every night they weren't feeling so desperate and every night they weren't wondering how on earth their life was ever going to change. Putting the cashless debit card into these communities doesn't change that feeling; it entrenches that feeling. It entrenches a feeling of worthlessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This card does not support an addict getting off a drug. All of the studies have told you this, but you persist, and you leave me absolutely distraught. As my friend and as my other colleagues have pointed out, there are lots of ways that we can help and support people, but, when someone willingly comes to the table to seek that support, we know the outcomes are almost guaranteed to be effective. And in the communities that this is being rolled out into, this legislation suggests all you're going to do is increase stigma.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bass mentioned something that I hadn't read yet, and that was the notion that there were different queues happening at supermarkets for those with one card and another. We've all had that, haven't we? Haven't we all been in a supermarket where you've forgotten your PIN and you're standing there with a basket of groceries? What's the first thing you think? You don't think: oh, the whole supermarket will know I've forgotten my PIN. What you think is: the whole supermarket thinks I've got no money. That's what you're fearful of. So, if the studies had supported this, you might have convinced some of us over here. But it hasn't. The minister conceded that he hadn't even read the report, hadn't even read the review, that cost millions of dollars. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We sat here earlier in the year on Close the Gap Day, and I was appalled listening to the Prime Minister, because I thought that he was very close—in fact, he was suggesting that we should reduce the targets, because we hadn't reached them. I'm from a place in education where we work on targets; we work on data. And the last thing you do is go, 'Oh, that looks a bit too hard; let's make it a bit easier on ourselves.' Imagine if our schools did that. Imagine if our schools did that, member for Bowman. You'd be in here yelling at them every day if they did that—if a school said, 'We've set these targets. They're way too high. We need to make them a bit easier.' But that's what the Prime Minister was suggesting in here on Close the Gap Day: 'It's all too hard. Let's reduce the target. Let's make it easier on ourselves.' Or, worse: 'Let's scrap them.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was a bit of a change of heart and a different tone. The Prime Minister came in here and made a speech about not doing 'to'—remember?—but about doing 'with'. Let me tell you, the communities that this is focused on, they tell me—here it is again—'It's about us, and it's done without us. It's going to be done to us.' It is, under no circumstances, something that should be happening in this country—in the country that we all love. It just shouldn't be happening. We shouldn't be in here debating this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This program should not be being expanded. The trials, where they have evidence that they are working, should be reviewed again to see if they're still working. Because, fundamentally, this creates a system where some Australians are different to others—different in economic terms, different in social terms and seen differently by their government. There is no way around this, guys. There's only one way this is perceived anywhere in Australia. They see the discrimination in this. They are appalled by the discrimination in this. And even those who thought, 'Let's give it a go and see how it goes' are saying, 'Where's the evidence to say it's working?' Well, the evidence is not there to say it's working, but we're going to expand it. We're going to increase the number of people who are included and the number of people who are being seen as separate, different and other by the Australian government. So what's the point of any constitutional conversation about who's Australian; who isn't Australian? Why do we bother with Closing the Gap when, with the other hand, we bring in discriminatory legislation that clearly discriminates on geography and discriminates on race just purely on numbers? </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd close my remarks to say that it's another situation where, on this side of the House, we continue to stand up for people. I'm pleased to see the member for Bass has come in here tonight and spoken from her conscience and stood up for Australians across the country. I'm disappointed that the member for Bass said that she wasn't actually going to vote against this bill, because I think it would have been symbolic—and I think there are others on that side who would have stood beside her, if she'd chosen to do it. I wonder—and I'm being very cynical—if this is not the moment that the pairing arrangements that we have in place for COVID do not shine a light on the fact that members opposite may be outside when we vote on this tonight because they've asked to vote on it tonight when the member for Bass is paired out of this room. Sorry, but you need to know that that's what's happening. Because if you didn't know in your party room, then you need to know now. We're going to vote on this tonight, and the member for Bass is going to be paired out of this chamber. For all of the people who think that the COVID regulations can't be used this way and that it's still representative, this shines a light on that as well. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  I rise to speak on this important bill, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Continuation of Cashless Welfare) Bill. I want to add my voice to the support for the amendment that my esteemed colleague the member for Barton has circulated. It's worth noting once again, in the middle of this debate, what the amendment is. It calls on the House to note:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) thirteen years after the Howard Government's so-called Intervention in the Northern Territory, there is no evidence that compulsory, broad-based income management works;</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the Minister decided to make the Cashless Debit Card trial permanent before reading the independent review by Adelaide University; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) this proposal is racially discriminatory, as approximately 68 per cent of the people impacted are First Nations Australians …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it calls on the government to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) not roll out the Cashless Debit Card nationally; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) invest in evidence-based policies, job creation and services, rather than ideological policies like the Cashless Debit Card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bass outlined a number of such policies that could be used in her own electorate instead of the cashless debit card, and we've heard from many previous speakers on the problems with this card. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not support this bill. In essence it is a racist bill, an ideological bill, a bill developed without an evidential base and a bill that impinges upon human rights and freedoms under the guise of fixing serious social issues. In fact, it is a bill that creates more problems than it purports to fix. It's a typical Liberal Party response; it is punitive and taps into negative populism, entrenching bias and disadvantage. We on this side of the House were profoundly disappointed to see that the government brought this bill forward for debate in NAIDOC Week, a week when we celebrate the achievements of First Nations peoples, appreciate their resilience and recognise their struggle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a non-Indigenous woman, I take my cues and I learn from my esteemed colleagues—the member for Barton, and Senators Dodson and McCarthy—when it comes to First Nations policy and legislation in this place. I listen to the people in the First Nations communities in my electorate, and there are many. And I hear the voices of First Nations people nationally, particularly through that seminal communique, the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a statement that Labor is committed to enacting. What they've taught me is that listening and talking is important but that, in truth, it is only part of what must be done. What is equally important, and harder to do, is taking action—actually doing the hard work of reconciliation. The Liberals talk a big game when it comes to reconciliation, but when push comes to shove they are not there to do the hard work. It's just like what we saw last month in the Senate, where the Liberal Party voted against a motion to hang the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. Again, they voted against that during NAIDOC Week. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms KEARNEY:</span>
                    </a>  As we know, this bill, as has been stated time and time again by members from this side of the House, does actually affect more Aboriginal people. It is discriminatory because, as a percentage of people that this affects, First Nations people are disproportionately represented. Now the government is pushing through this legislation, which is an incredibly clear example of policy being done to First Nations people and not with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make the cashless debit card permanent in the existing trial sites of Ceduna, East Kimberley, the Goldfields, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. It will permanently replace the BasicsCard with the cashless debit card in the Northern Territory. The bill will also replace the BasicsCard with the cashless debit card in Cape York and extend income management in Cape York to 31 December 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the community of Cape York is in a unique situation with community management at its heart. It's a system that is not replicated across the country with the use of this card. We have long stated very clearly that, if people want to be on the card, that is their right, and it is not up to Labor to stand in the way, but it has to be done with full and informed consent. As far as I can see, there has not been full and informed consent in any of the other communities in terms of what the government is intending to do with this card. As the member for Barton said, the agenda is very clear. It is a continuation of the disdain that this government holds in relation to people who need to rely on social security payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that the bill will make it easier for people to volunteer to be placed on the cashless debit card or allow a person to remain on the card when they move outside one of the prescribed areas if they want to, but it also enables the secretary to make value judgements about people far from their view and in another world, disconnected from anyone they know, to revoke the cashless debit card exit provisions. They can decide that they no longer believe that the person who exited the card is reasonably and responsibly managing their affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear time and time again that applications to come off the card fail. It's almost impossible to be allowed to come off the card, despite people showing that they are managing their own affairs and that they are reasonable people. They should be allowed to come off the card. We know that it is virtually impossible. So few people are allowed to come off the card. In a fairer world than that run by the Liberal government, of course, coming off the card wouldn't be necessary, as you wouldn't be on one in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might assume that a bill this far reaching would have an incredible weight of evidence backing it in. Well, you'd be wrong. The University of Adelaide has undertaken a review of the cashless debit card—an independent review by a reputable institution—yet in Senate estimates the minister was forced to admit that she had not read the review by Adelaide university before she and this government decided to make the cashless debit card trials permanent. It's unbelievable. It just says so much about this government's callous disregard for people's lives that it could press ahead with this without paying attention to the facts, without paying attention to the evidence and without paying attention to what is actually going on in people's lives. Just yesterday I was speaking about the Family Court bill. The government has done a similar thing here. They put together a whole piece of legislation that ignores all the evidence. The result is that we have legislation that does exactly the opposite of what this country needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the government doesn't seem to be aware, let me outline what some of the relevant research has found. Researchers from four universities said in a report released in February this year that they had uncovered an overwhelming number of negative experiences stemming from the card, ranging from feelings of stigma, shame and frustration to practical issues, such as the cardholder simply not having enough cash for essential items or important things like paying for their child to go to school camp or buying the little things that they need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no wonder the community has been incredibly vocal on the issue of the cashless debit card. They know that it is in its essence a racist program—one that disproportionately targets First Nations peoples and takes away their agency and their control over their own money, their lives and their families' lives. Sixty-eight per cent of those affected by this bill are First Nations people. I've had hundreds of emails on this issue, with people describing it as blatant discrimination, harking back to paternalistic colonial policies, which we had all hoped our country had moved beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm lucky to represent an electorate that is home to 12 First Nations peak bodies. Their position has been united and clear on this issue. They have told me that no-one should have this program forced on them, that this program so clearly represents the colonial attitudes that they struggle against every day and that it is yet another example of the government telling them that they aren't equals, that they don't deserve to have control over their own lives and that they need the oversight and patronising paternalism of the government to survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm humbled to be here today in my position of privilege to be able to amplify in this chamber the voices of the people who have come to me as their elected representative. They're asking not to be forced into this program, not to have it forced onto their communities that simply don't want it. Rather than blame and punish people in Australia, the government should be putting all its energy into reinvestment opportunities to close the gap. Many of those, as I said earlier, were described by the member for Bass. She was absolutely right when she said that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overwhelming message from this year's <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap</span> report is that, 12 years on, the statistics, the numbers, the human outcomes are getting worse, not better. Labor knows that closing the gap depends on all Australians acknowledging the continuing trauma of colonisation and the stolen generations. This is what Prime Minister Keating acknowledged when he spoke at Redfern 26 years ago and declared:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It begins, I think, with that act of recognition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to listen, learn and take direction from our First Nations people. So we need to commit to no longer making decisions about them and for them. We cannot ignore the lessons nor ignore the way forward. We need constitutional recognition. We need to keep the process of reconciliation alive. We need to work towards a makarrata commission of truth telling and healing. And ultimately we need treaty, because I honestly believe that, if we had treaty, bills like this would never exist.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  It is a delight to join this very impassioned and important debate about the cashless welfare card. The case from the opposition is very much that this policy is racist, punitive, shameful and costly. I will try and address those four key points, but I will focus on the evidence. Many of us have visited Indigenous communities. You will hear both sides of the cashless welfare card debate there, so it's inevitable that we would listening to the voices that suit our line of reasoning. That is only natural. But it's very important that all of us don't just fly in like seagulls, spend a day and talk to our chosen spokespeople.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a particular interest in speaking to members in this chamber who've lived in a remote Indigenous community, paid the rates, paid the rent, lived locally and seen it for themselves. I'm not one who has done that. In 1993 and 1994, in that very, very difficult time pre welfare controls and welfare cards, I was spending a lot of time in Lajamanu, a semidesert Warlpiri community in the Northern Territory. That work in 1993 and 1994 gave me the time to spend night after night and week after week in this community and see the ravages of petrol sniffing at the time. The Warlpiri people, speaking their language, would meet in large groups and mourn the inability of traditional Indigenous structures to deal with petrol and how they could communicate with the youth that they felt that they'd lost. These kinds of problems, when you've seen them firsthand—I couldn't understand the Warlpiri conversations, except the term 'petrol sniffing', because they didn't have a word for the very thing that the traditional culture was attempting to control and deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The card is not perfect, of course. The card is in many ways the best way that a Western system can deal with its own limitations, which is the payment of cash as a form of income replacement. Even the payment of cash itself creates problems, a point this debate seems to have almost neglected, because before the card we paid cash, and we had terrible problems. Were I to be introducing cash I would make all these same arguments about cash. This is a relative debate about the change between the payment of cash and the introduction of a portion of that payment not being cash. It is a very subtle argument that I feel is being lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing racist about the policy. It is true that some of these types of social malaise are higher in Indigenous communities. It is true we went first to the parts of this great nation where these concerns were greatest, but we got Indigenous community support for it, and the first thing we said was that this card will apply to everyone here, not just to Indigenous Australians. It is a great disappointment for me that the Labor Party continues to muddy the waters there. It is true it has been introduced in areas of predominant Indigenous population. It was done with community agreement and it applied to every Australian. It's a shame that that gets liquid papered away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The elements of punitive and shame around these cards are very hard to avoid. It's quite right that there can be significant shame about being placed on a card; I don't deny that. There's significant stress and trauma about sitting a NAPLAN test; I can't help that either. But it is a shame if elected representatives kick that shame along and promote it, and fan the flames of shame by continuing to vocalise it. I can appreciate some people will not like a government policy, but, to be honest, everything has been done in this policy to make it applicable and acceptable. Honestly, we are both cultures that now live on credit cards. We live with cashless payments, whether they come from an employer or the government. My entire life is cashless now. To simply claim and poke people and say, 'Your card's a different colour,' is to overly aggravate this debate in a negative way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could see self-evidently that gambling and alcohol were causing a problem. And it's not that we say nothing else works. To the members on the other side, I say that the pedal is on the floor with every other program money can afford and we still can't fix the problem. I think it's a very high bar to say: 'You know what? You introduced the card and the problems didn't go away.' That's not a failure of the card any more than it's a failure of the social worker who's delivering social services or the OT who's delivering occupational therapy services; they don't fail because the problem wasn't fixed. This is one of a range in this causal web of dysfunction that exists in every corner of Australia—black and white, and everything in between—and we need to work in every corner to do our very best. The card is just one extra element of it. It deserves to be studied, it deserves to be evaluated and it deserves to be excoriated if people find that that, in fact, is what's happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reality, this is one intervention sitting alongside a range of other reforms. I think the government's done a good job over time to technologically make this card almost indistinguishable from a credit card. You'd need a PhD to work out the difference when you're using those two cards—a cashless debit card and a credit card—going through a tiny supermarket or your local store.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest here: where it's been introduced, virtually everyone in those communities is on the card. We've now moved to Bundaberg in doing a mainstream trial. I think it's repugnant to say, 'In Bundaberg 95 per cent of the people on the card are white, so this is racist against whites.' That's the absolute counterargument to what's being put to us today. It's nothing to do with the colour of your skin. Thank you so much to the member for Petrie for standing up and saying that this has got nothing to do with race. This is a great country that's trying to pull itself together and close gaps. It's wrong to characterise this card in such a way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been multiple independent evaluations. Not all of them have been positive; we accept that. What I want to do is go through the incontrovertible evidence that there is less drinking reported, fewer drugs reported and less gambling reported—and that was the goal of the card. It didn't say those things would go away with the card; anyone who's lived in a community would understand they don't go away. We're only quarantining 80 per cent anyway, so there's still 20 per cent there. I'm speaking for Australians in every other corner of this country who would say it's only reasonable that 80 per cent of a taxpayer transfer to someone on income replacement should be spent on their kids, on food and on basic household expenses. Twenty per cent is still there for all the gambling and alcohol that you want. That point seems lost on the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I come into this great place to say that I stand for the 25 per cent of people in these areas who report that they drink less alcohol. Very few say that they drink more alcohol because of the card. I stand with those 25 per cent. I'm not going to have that ripped away from them. I stand for the 22 per cent who reported reducing the number of times that they drink and the number of episodes of heavy drinking. I'm not going to have that ripped away from them. I will stand with those 22 per cent. It doesn't mean that the other 78 per cent are drinking more and more frequently. That's not the case at all; they're not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there's a positive change in gambling behaviours. Twenty-one per cent of addicted gamblers have said that the card has created a positive change, and 35 per cent of that 21 per cent said it helped in gambling for themselves. More importantly, 43 per cent said it helped in relation to their extended family, 38 per cent in relation to their friends and 60 per cent in relation to what gambling is going on in their community. I won't have that ripped away from them. There's no-one gambling more because of this card. I'm not going to let those people down. Over 40 per cent of CDC participants say they feel safer. I'm not going to have that ripped away from them. Twenty per cent of cashless debit card recipients say that they've been able to reduce illicit drugs use, one of the most addictive things there is, and they report that it's reducing. I can't find any other program around the country that does that. If it exists, I'll roll it out next to the card, complementary, as a partnership approach. Fundamentally, we needed a way to stop the fanning of the fire and the supply of the cash that was creating this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forty-five per cent of respondents reported that the cashless debit card improved things for them in general terms most of the time. That's about half the community. And the other half reported that things didn't change much. I'm not going to rip that away from that 45 per cent. When we look at the initial evaluation—that was two years ago—41 per cent reported drinking less alcohol, with 37 per cent bingeing less frequently. These are extraordinary numbers and they need to be recognised in this place. Forty-eight per cent were gambling less back in 2017. Forty per cent of parents said they could look after their children better. I'm not going to rip that away from that 40 per cent. Forty-five per cent said they were saving money for the first time or better able to save money. There's no doubt the card does that. A family can find more money than they can dream of on the card because the money isn't being spent in some of these other restricted areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Merchants themselves reinforce this, saying that there are increased purchases of baby items, food, clothing, shoes, toys and other goods. I will never stop the card when it means a child won't be locked in the bathroom in faeces covered nappies while their parents do drugs or alcohol; I can certainly help these parents who report these massive changes. There's increased motivation to find employment. Our culture has had millennia to get used to alcohol and to realise that you can consume it so long as you can turn up to work the next day. The moment you can't, there's a problem and there has to be some kind of intervention. Those sorts of practises haven't had time to permeate through every corner of the nation. One day they will, but in the meantime we need to ensure that government transfers for income replacement aren't spent on unlimited grog. We're just saying that grog can't be more than a fifth of the household expenditure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most close to my heart is the Australian Early Development Census. We do it every year; prep teachers all around the country do it. These figures are extraordinary. Up in Kununurra, in the western desert, we saw very few solutions to heavy alcohol consumption. The number of vulnerable kids reported lacking two domains of progress fell significantly in Kununurra at the time of introducing the card. There were significant improvements in social competence, emotional maturity, language, cognition, communication skills and general knowledge. I've lived in a community where there was endemic petrol sniffing and foetal alcohol syndrome, and we knew of nothing that could make any difference to foetal alcohol syndrome. We had no solution. We couldn't even stop mums we could see were pregnant drinking alcohol all day, every day with their other child strapped in a stroller. There are no pubs in the communities I'm talking about. Children were strapped in strollers all day under a tree. We're trying to reduce the amount of money spent on alcohol, and the card has done that absolutely and obviously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've reviewed emergency food relief vouchers and the use of parcels in Ceduna. Within 18 months of being placed on the card, around one-sixth of participants no longer needed or needed way less assistance in that area. I will not rip that away from those parents. From 16 March through to 19 March, the three-year period, the unemployment rate across all four sites had fallen by at least one per cent in the context of nothing ever having reduced unemployment before. We can see when we look at merchant data that these cards have a stabilising force and they assist participants in paying for essential items. The Labor Party says that this card is a shame, when the reality shows that participants can actually pay for what they need. The card is a source of not shame but pride. Administrative data shows us that over $2.8 million worth of alcohol would have been purchased but hasn't been thanks to the card, and that includes gambling products. That's a significant reduction in alcohol sales. Obviously, those sales would have gone ahead without the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the COVID supplement in March this year, it was a very interesting natural experiment. Around $10 million has been spent within supermarkets and grocery stores—a huge jump—but the question is: what has it been spent on?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About $1.2 million of that has been spent on clothes and shoes, and a lot of that was for children. I will not rip it away from those families. But before you can suggest that this is just about more cash flowing through a community, there's evidence also of an increased spending on recreational goods and appliances. Examples would include TVs, PlayStations and other recreational equipment. But, for the first time, families that could barely live, as the previous speaker said, between payment fortnights are in a position now to buy recreational and other retail elements that could never be afforded before. What I am saying will infuriate urban Labor MPs, who are utterly out of touch with the conditions in remote Australia. They flew in in a Cessna, flew out that afternoon, spoke to the two people who were annoyed by the cashless debit card and were reinforced and brought it back here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's arguments in this chamber about shame and about the punitive nature of the card, characterising it as racist and calling it shameful and costly, is one of the most disappointing elements of this debate. We can have this debate, and the card is not everything—but the card is something. The card has done its job clearly, by evaluation. And, in the context of remote Australia, where these are some of the hardest and most perennial and ingrained problems, maybe these solutions will be intergenerational. But I finish where I started: with these massive numbers of people who have ameliorated behaviour—reduced gambling; reduced drinking; are able to feed, support and educate their children for the first time. I will not walk away from you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  I speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Barton with respect to this legislation. This is important legislation because it directly and significantly impacts the lives of the people impacted by the cashless welfare card. As we have heard, most of those people are First Nations people, with figures ranging from somewhere between 68 per cent and 80 per cent of those affected being First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After 232 years of white settlement in this country, there is no doubt that Indigenous Australians continue to face discrimination and that, in turn, raises issues of human rights, natural justice, dignity, self-respect and equality. Indeed, only today, a report was released from <span style="font-style:italic;">The inclusive Australia social inclusion index</span> for 2019-20, which said, 'It paints a sobering picture for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the group facing the most discrimination in Australia and the group hardest hit by intersectional discrimination.' That report was only released today and highlights that Indigenous Australians continue to be the group most discriminated against in this country, and no amount of platitudes or patronising by the Morrison government will wash away that discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, in my view, has parallels with the child protection act of about a hundred years ago, which resulted in the stolen generation. That action also was carried out at the time in the misguided belief that children were being protected and that taking children from their families was being done for their own good. Likewise, it is now being claimed that the cashless welfare card is being imposed on those people for their own good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is like so much of the legislation that has been brought into this parliament by the Morrison government. It is brought in without proper consultation and without sufficient support from those that are going to be directly affected. And I say to the minister and members opposite, who quite often talk about the communication with the people affected: communication is not consultation. Communication from this government, most of the time, is simply telling people what is going to happen to them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, of course, other very serious concerns about this proposal. I find it absolutely extraordinary that the government would commission a $2½ million study from Adelaide university and then, before the study has even been released or read by the minister, prepare and introduce legislation in this place to continue this card across the country. Why would you spend public money on research if you're not going to listen to the findings of the research that the money was spent on? It's an insult to the researchers and, quite frankly, it's an insult to the Australian taxpayers who paid for it in the first place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also say to members on the government side who come in here and continually rely on statistics that show that maybe things are working that it reminds me very much of the issue of homelessness in the Adelaide CBD. When measures were put in to try to address that issue, all they did was simply push the problem out into the suburbs. Yes, the CBD became a place where homelessness wasn't as visible as it had been previously, and the people who were previously there were no longer there. But the problem had not been resolved at all; it had simply been moved to other communities. And I suspect that that's exactly what would happen with respect to this legislation, once people were put onto the card. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this as well—and I've had this submission put to me by several people who have been working within the communities where the card already exists. What the card does is limit what people can buy and it limits where they can buy things from, and that in turn has a detrimental effect on their spending ability because, if they're outside of the community or if they're in a place that does not accept the card, they can't buy any bargains that might exist from time to time, as most people shopping in all other places would be able to do. So the card limits their ability to survive, given that they are already welfare dependent and therefore need to make the most of every dollar that is given to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I say to the member for Bowman, who tried to compare this card with the cashless society that we live in and suggest that it is little different to a credit card, this card is very different to a credit card. A credit card can be used in any retail facility where they wish to buy a product. This card can't be. What this card says to the people who are issued with it is: 'You are very different to the rest of society. You will be treated very differently, and you can't hide from that, because every time you walk into a store or you talk to your colleagues about what you can do they'll know that you are being treated very differently to someone else.' It comes back to the issue not only of discrimination but of the dignity of the people who are affected by it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should listen to the people who know best and the people who have made submissions to the Senate inquiry. The government should listen to the people who have now been subjected to the card not for a few months but for years. It should properly analyse what results the card has had in those communities and then come back to the parliament with the kind of legislation that addresses the causes of the problems, rather than simply trying to control how people can spend their money. I say to members opposite that I do accept that, for many of you, this proposal is well intended, but I also say to government members that, although it may be well intended, as one of your own members, the member for Bass, pointed out in this chamber, it is the wrong way to go about trying to address serious problems in our communities.</span>

He always makes a fine and considered contribution. I'm now in my 14th year of speaking after him, and I'm happy to do so. Labor opposes the extension of the existing cashless debit card trial sites unless there is clear evidence of local community support. That is crucial. What this bill will do is make permanent the cashless debit card trial sites of Ceduna, in South Australia, an area that I've visited for this; the East Kimberley; the Goldfields, which is Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie and surrounding areas; and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region in Queensland. It makes those trial sites permanent, irrespective of the views of locals. The bill will permanently replace the BasicsCard with the cashless debit card in the Northern Territory, and it will replace the BasicsCard with the cashless debit card in Queensland's Cape York and extend income management in Cape York until the end of next year. This legislation will also make it easier for a person to volunteer to be placed on a cashless debit card and allow a person to remain on a cashless debit card when they move outside one of the prescribed areas. It will enable the secretary to review and revoke cashless debit card exit provisions if the secretary no longer believes a person who exited the card is reasonably and responsibly managing their own affairs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card trial sites in Ceduna, the East Kimberley, the Goldfields and the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay region were just that, trial sites. The reason governments have trials or pilots for some policy initiatives is to review how they work and see whether they are worth refining and rolling out further or should be pulled back because they're not working. Remember, the residents in these areas were actually conscripted guinea pigs when it comes to this government policy. But, with these trials, the Morrison government was not interested in finding out whether or not they were actually successful. It took longstanding criticisms about the lack of evidence available on the trials before the Morrison government eventually committed to an independent review. But before even receiving the review, the Morrison government announced that the trials would be made permanent. The review conducted by the University of South Australia concluded:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a clear pattern with this Morrison government, and we've seen it time and time again. Almost every policy that Prime Minister Morrison tries to ram through this parliament—I think that, fundamentally, he'd rather just run things through without that nasty inconvenience of democracy—is against the recognised expert advice. Prime Minister Morrison proudly gets out his stamp and stamps it on every bill: 'Ignored my experts.' That's what he stamps on the document. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, we've seen the Family Court merger bills being rammed through the House—bills that will abolish the specialist standalone Family Court of Australia. Liberal and National Party members were the only ones who voted for it. Not Labor, not the Greens and not one crossbencher. You managed to unite Bob Katter and  the member for Mayo on a unity ticket! Not one crossbencher voted for it. Do you know why? Because all of the expert evidence says it is a really bad idea—hundreds of stakeholder groups. Still, the Prime Minister got out his stamp that said: 'Ignored my experts.' He's proud of it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the House has debated a bill that effectively returns unemployment payments to the old Newstart rate after 31 March next year. Who thinks that's a good idea? Well, not the Australian Council of Social Services, not the Council on the Ageing Australia, not the Australian Human Rights Commission, nor a range of other community sector organisations, peak bodies and groups representing social security payment recipients and economists, who all made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry raising concerns. Even the Australian Retailers Association, not exactly a cabal of lefties, I would suggest, has said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the Morrison government has not listened to the experts, but has pigheadedly followed its own ideology to the detriment of all Australians. Prime Minister Morrison again pulled out his stamp that he sits up there next to his 'World's Cruellest Immigration Minister Trophy' and, bam, again puts on the stamp: 'Ignored my experts.' </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill in front of the chamber is no different. Again, the Morrison government is actually ignoring its own independent analysis. In fact, it didn't even bother reading the report before committing to making the current trial sites permanent. Even worse than not listening to the experts is not listening to the First Nations communities who will be impacted the hardest by this legislation. Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory told a Senate inquiry into the bill: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… our perspective on the cashless debit card, from the enormous consultation we’ve had with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, is that they don’t want it, hence why we’re calling on the Senate not to support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations communities, the people who have the oldest words on earth, should have words that are listened to by this parliament. They should be listened to. 'Nothing about us without us.' That's a pretty good rule of thumb when it comes to First Nations people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will disproportionately impact First Nations people: 68 per cent of the people who will be forced onto the cashless debit card are First Nations Australians. That's 23,000 out of the 34,000 people impacted by this card who will be Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, and 18,000 people will be in the Northern Territory. We suspected what the Morrison government's real agenda was, but this bill has finally exposed that this government's real agenda is a big, permanent rollout of the card. With all of the problems associated with it that have been detailed by previous speakers, one that I would particularly touch on was called out by the member for Makin. I think he belled the cat: if you remove people's ability to have pride when they go about living their life, you crush their souls. For a government that professes to care about mental health, that is a dangerous road to go down. Labor is opposed to income management programs that may catch and disempower the wrong people, such as this type of broad-based, compulsory income management program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But some income management programs can be justified—programs that are targeted. In Cape York, the local community is applying income management based on individual circumstances, and it supports the families and monitors the outcomes. That type of income management is appropriate where community support continues as that rule, 'Nothing about us without us.' This rule is being applied in the Cape York area. The Cape York Welfare Reform project commenced more than 12 years ago. It arose from a partnership with four Cape York communities, the Queensland government, the Commonwealth government and the Cape York Institute. The Cape York Welfare Reform was grounded by the establishment of the Family Responsibilities Commission, the FRC, which was legislated by Premier Anna Bligh back in 2008. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FRC is an example of Indigenous empowerment. Its structure was designed by Cape York people for Cape York families. It shifts power and responsibility from government, distant government—remember, Brisbane is as close to Cape York as it is to Melbourne—to the community itself, to respected local elders and leaders acting as local family responsibility commissioners. The FRC commissioners have the power to call people in and conference with them if they fail to send their children to school or if they've been the subject of a child safety notice, or if they've committed an offence or failed to pay their rent. Income management orders are part of a number of measures available under the conditional welfare approach in the Cape York model, but only after restorative justice conferencing from local FRC commissioners. Clients are also linked to extra support services to motivate and build capacity for change—'Nothing about us without us.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Cape York model, income management is not a blanket restriction imposed on all, and it is not permanent. It has the hope of rehabilitation and change. The order can be removed by the local FRC commissioners where a person has shown that they've taken steps to change and to fulfil their obligations—the ability to have pride and a job et cetera, all of those things that humans are built for. There is overwhelming community support for the Cape York Welfare Reform: 'Nothing about us without us.' Cape York communities do not want distant governments deciding their futures for them. When I say 'distant governments' I mean Brisbane not Canberra. </span>

The National Council of Single Mothers and their Children told the Senate committee:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The distress, shame and hardship it causes to people (disproportionately, women, mothers and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in all current trial sites) is based on a false assumption that stripping people of autonomy and dignity will solve serious health and social issues. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this bill is just the beginning of a brutal government's plan to roll out the cashless debit card. We know some in the Morrison government have been calling for a national rollout. We know the Morrison government has established a technology working group with the big banks, the supermarkets and Australia Post, and a few other people connected with the government, to look at how this can be rolled out through the payment system. All of the actions of this government point toward a national rollout. That would allow Prime Minister Morrison to track and control what people on social security do with their money, money that they as Australian citizens are entitled to. Pensioners are already scared that they could be compulsorily put on a cashless debit card. What will the government do then? Will they roll the program out to those receiving franking credits? Just kidding. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously Labor does not support this bill. There is absolutely zero evidence that the trials have been successful. This bill is punitive. This bill racially discriminates. It will detrimentally affect the most disenfranchised people in Australia. It is a backward policy that harks of the Howard government's so-called Intervention in the Northern Territory that was a whitefella failure, irrespective of whatever motivated it. This bill won't create a single job. It won't improve anyone's living conditions and it won't close the gap. Labor does not support this bill but it does support the amendment, and I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Continuation of Cashless Welfare) Bill. I will always respect this House, but my message on this proposed legislation is plain and simple: it is trash. More than a decade ago, former Prime Minister John Howard launched his intervention into the Northern Territory. This policy was retrograde. It took away First Nations people's freedoms, it was discriminatory and it did nothing to help. Sadly, nothing much has changed. We still see leaders of the Liberal Party pretending to be concerned for our country's First Nations people. Despite the rhetoric of partnership and respect, this legislation is not about self-determination. It is the opposite. It entrenches a sense of powerlessness and ignores the wisdom of the Uluru statement. The draft legislation before us will make the cashless debit card permanent in existing trial sites of Ceduna, East Kimberley, the Goldfields, Bundaberg-Hervey Bay. It also seeks to permanently replace the BasicsCard with the cashless debit card across the Northern Territory even if recipients move to other locations. In short, this bill would enact a widespread rollout of the government's compulsory income management program—a program that doesn't respect people's rights to make choices about how they spend their money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is proposed despite the fact that First Nations people have wholly rejected it. The Morrison government has conducted trials, evidence has been gathered and the answer is simple—the program doesn't work. But brazen disregard for evidence based policy continues to be an operational imperative for this government. My constituents have been absolutely stunned to learn that the minister responsible for this program did not even read the independent review conducted by the University of Adelaide before making the decision to roll out this horribly flawed program. What is the point of a trial if the government is determined to be led by racial prejudice regarding the trial results? I proudly stand with the shadow minister for families and social services, who is calling on the government to bin this rubbish bill. The Labor Party opposes this program because it is yet another example of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government reaching into the lives of Australians without reason. The Labor Party opposes this program because it is based on prejudice rather than evidence. And the Labor Party opposes this program because it will not help our First Nations people achieve self-determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has also brought to light the gravest fears of many Australians. This government has an agenda to roll out the cashless card regardless of its impact. We've watched on as this government feigned an interest in testing the card. But now we know with certainty that the government does not care and never cared about getting the program right. This was laid bare for all to see when the minister admitted that she had not consulted, considered, or read the much awaited independent review by the University of Adelaide. On 6 October, the government announced its intention to make the cashless debit card a permanent restrictive feature in the lives of so many. Then, on 8 October, the government introduced enacting legislation to this parliament. And then, on 29 October, the senator representing the Northern Territory Malarndirri McCarthy asked the minister a very simple question: 'Minister, have you read the report?' The minister's reply: 'No.' The minister had not even bothered to read the relevant report. This fact says it all. This flagrant disrespect of the evidence is mind-boggling. And, what's worse, this government is playing with the lives of so many. The senator and minister for social services takes home about $400,000 Australian tax dollars a year, plus allowances, and can't find the time to read the report. It's not good enough, plain and simple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is more, this bill is racist. It's discriminatory. The rollout of the cashless debit card, as proposed by the Morrison government, will impact First Nations people disproportionately. About 70 per cent of the people this government is forcing onto the card are First Nations people. Of the 34,000 people directly impacted, 23,000 are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. Eighteen thousand live in the Northern Territory. This government said it was attentive to the review. This government said it was listening to the feedback. Then this government didn't even read the report. Such actions reveal this government believes in action without consultation and the government believes in driving our communities apart. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is not what Labor believes. We believe that Australia is made up of powerful, capable communities that are better united than divided. We also believe that income management will sometimes be necessary—just not this income management, because this income management is a sledgehammer. Instead, Labor believes in the careful, thoughtful use of income management as a targeted tool in specific cases. One example of this, as some of my colleagues have already mentioned, is child protection. We acknowledge that there will be times when government intervention is required. When the circumstances of individuals receiving the payments are taken into account, we can support families and improve outcomes. That's a very good thing. This bill is not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill isn't a good thing, because this compulsory income-management program doesn't drive better results. That's what we should all want in this House: to drive better results. The program entrenches both dependency on the state and a sense of hopelessness, with little opportunity for a path to employment. We know the government knows this, because it wrote it in a report to the UN. This government wrote of income management:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While there are more positive results associated with people who volunteer, as they have made a choice to change their behaviour and receive assistance, positive findings have been found for people who have been referred for Income Management by a social worker or a child protection officer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compulsory income management is not enabling. It is not a path to self-determination. Instead, it locks them into a life of dependency. The 2014 independent <span style="font-style:italic;">Evaluating new income management in the Northern Territory</span>, conducted by the Social Policy Research Centre, found that 90 per cent of those on income management were Indigenous and 77 per cent of those were on compulsory income management. More than 60 per cent of this group were on income management for more than six years. Of those Indigenous people on compulsory income management, a mere five per cent gained an exemption, compared to 36 per cent of non-Indigenous people. Even when First Nations people apply to remove themselves from compulsory income management because they seek self-determination, only one in 20 have been granted an exemption, compared to more than one in three for non-Indigenous people. This is discriminatory and it is racist. This government has undertaken a process showing clear contempt for the coalitions of peaks and makes a mockery of the government's new Closing the Gap Partnership Agreement. </span>

It is time the Morrison government listened to its people: to all First Nations people, to all Australians who believe in fairness, democracy and in people being able to make choices about their own lives—to self-determination. Let's bin this bill. May it never see the light of day again.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak tonight in opposition to this government's deeply flawed, punitive and, frankly, racist bill to impose a permanent and compulsory income management system in the form of a cashless debit card. This bill, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Continuation of Cashless Welfare) Bill 2020, will make the cashless debit card a permanent feature in all of the trial sites—Ceduna, the East Kimberley, the Goldfields and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area—and permanently replace the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory with the cashless debit card, effectively extending the cashless debit card system to the entire Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other components of this bill, some of which I might get time to discuss, but what I really want to draw the attention of this House to tonight is the fact that this bill highlights what is a fundamental problem for this government, and that is the continuation of failed approaches. I say this based on much of the evidence that has come before numerous inquiries into the cashless debit card. It is based on historical experience, on our 13 years of the Intervention into the Northern Territory and the drastic consequences for First Nations people in the Territory as a result of 13 years of an income management system that has been a vehicle for nothing but disempowerment and the continuation of stigmatisation and, indeed, trauma for many of those First Nations peoples and communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It infuriates me that this government lacks the imagination to make an effort to understand the systemic issues around poverty and disenfranchisement and, indeed, the marginalisation that many First Nations peoples and communities feel. Legislation like this, which is before this House this evening, is some of the laziest policymaking I have seen. I say this because this government appears to have learnt nothing when it comes to looking at the history of policymaking in First Nations affairs. This legislation runs completely counter to the commitment that the Prime Minister made back in July in this very chamber, where he was praising a new approach from the government. He said that there would be a new partnership formed, and this was in light of an ongoing failure to make any inroads into the Closing the Gap targets. The Prime Minister said that we were going to remedy this by having a new partnership with First Nations people and that First Nations people would not only have a say in how something is delivered but would also be part of a co-design process in order to determine those service deliveries in their communities. I'm sorry, but there's nothing in this legislation that stands up to that promise the Prime Minister gave in this House to First Nations people in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is a shocking continuation of the failed approaches to consultation, engagement and public policy making. I said earlier that this is lazy policymaking. I say that because the government perceives a crisis—and this is exactly what happened in the intervention period as well—and introduces a range of measures that are purported to be temporary. They are to manage a situation now. Remedies are to be put in place and eventually people will be able to resume control of their lives once communities are stabilised, people's health improves, housing is provided and all of those things. Of course, none of those underlying issues have been addressed in these communities. None of those things have been improved.</span>

Well, there isn't a plan. Indeed, when we have examined this, the research has shown how demonstrably—</span>

                    </a>  Other people will have an opportunity to speak. When they get the microphone they can knock themselves out. At the moment I am pointing to the profound lack of evidence based policymaking that is taking place in this country. I am pointing to the evidence that has been made available to the government. Let's not forget that this government actually commissioned, at a cost of $2½ million, Adelaide university to evaluate the cashless debit card trial. Yet did the government wait to hear what that important piece of research, that important evaluation of this program, had to say? No. It was pretty clear that the government was going to make a decision about the permanent rollout of this cashless debit card without any evidence. Indeed, Minister Ruston made clear in Senate estimates that she had not read the report. Fancy paying $2½ million for a report and not bothering to read it. They wonder why we on this side of the House dare ask questions about the fundamental lack of evidence that is informing the government's policy position tonight.</span>

As I said at the start, this bill continues to highlight the fundamental flaws and failed approaches that this government has taken in relation to any policy in First Nations communities in Australia. This has been the most interrupted speech I've delivered in this parliament for some time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  The reckless behaviour of payday lenders has gone on long enough. Data, as we know, from the Consumer Law Action Centre has shown the number of households with a payday loan has continued to skyrocket. The figures need to be told and told again: between April 2016 and 19 July—pre pandemic—just over 4.7 million individual payday loans were written, worth an approximate total of $3.09 billion. That represents around 1.77 million Australian households. Around 15 per cent of payday loan borrowers end up in a debt spiral, which leads to bankruptcy. The number of women accessing payday loans has jumped by 28 per cent, and 86 per cent of loans are now accessed through a website or on mobile or tablet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Morrison government sits by and does nothing, Australian families continue to be ripped off every day by the loan sharks in this out-of-control industry. Examples of people being exploited are endless. This includes heartbreaking stories from my home state in Queensland of sole parents who have been approached by payday lenders and signed up to rent a fridge on the spot. After electronic signatures have been captured, an individual was told that she would pay just $81.44 a fortnight. Two weeks later the full story was revealed with the fridge costing over $6,352 over three years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the ongoing economic fallout of COVID-19 and the winding back of support measures by this government, it's critical the Morrison government implements measures to protect people from exploitative lenders seeking to take advantage of their financial vulnerability. It's the difference between families being able to put a meal on their table for Christmas lunch and potentially falling under the poverty line. Payday loans are almost exclusively used by people on low or very low incomes to try to keep their heads above water. However, they often fall into a horrific debt cycle. This is due to the outrageous fees and interest rates of around 900 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A survey found that 4.7 million Australians are now very concerned about their financial wellbeing. The same survey found young people were three times more likely than the general population to have taken out a payday loan or consumer lease in July 2020 to make ends meet. Payday lenders have been exposed for sending text messages offering 'COVID relief loans'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been more than four years since this lazy government announced a review into the payday loans and rent-to-buy schemes. In 2015, despite repeated promises and supporting the 24 recommendations for the review, we are yet to see any action or clampdown on the loan sharks. As the cost of living rises drastically under this government, 1.77 million households have had to turn to payday loans just to get by. As if this wasn't bad enough, today we know more than 120 consumer legal and other associations, and almost 100 prominent individuals, have signed an open letter to MPs urging them to reject a bill that would axe important borrower protections. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer of Australia, Josh Frydenberg's decision to overhaul the National Consumer Credit Protection Act is an attempt at making it easier for consumers to obtain loans and spur growth as the economy is in deep recession. The government's bid to loosen lending laws does a decade of hard-fought consumer protections. In an open letter, which emanated from consumer advocate Choice, the Consumer Action Law Centre and Financial Counselling Australia, among others, it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are calling on you to stand up for Australians and block this harmful law when it is introduced into Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also says, these are:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">… essential consumer protections designed to protect ordinary people from the sorts of terrible lending practices we saw during the global financial crisis and banking royal commission</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If these rules and laws proceed, people will be worse off. Drastically relaxing lending rules in the midst of our worst recession in 30 years is a recipe for national disaster. Higher levels of household debt will slow the economic recovery. This is not economic sense. This is economic vandalism, with vulnerable and weak Australians in this government's sights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the shadow minister at the table, the member for Whitlam; the member for Richmond; and every other Labor member of parliament will fight what the government is trying to do. We will be on the side of consumers. We will stand up to the loan sharks and the banks in this country. The government will not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  This evening I'd like to talk about some of the recommendations that have been made by the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce. This is a group who say their job is to work to keep Australians updated with the latest evidence. The first recommendation they make is on the drug remdesivir. It is a conditional recommendation. However, the World Health Organization, on 20 November, issued a press release which states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">WHO has issued a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't have a problem with one of our organisations having a view opposite to that of the World Health Organization, but the concern is that we know what some of the social media giants, such as YouTube, have said. YouTube's CEO said it would ban and censor anything that went 'against World Health Organization recommendations' because it 'would be a violation of our policy'. will YouTube be censoring the recommendations of our national evidence task force?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second recommendation that was made and I would like to discuss tonight is the recommendation by the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce about the drug ivermectin. The national evidence task force recommendation is against using ivermectin. What is the evidence for ivermectin, a drug that was championed by the Australian professor Tom Borody months ago, but he was not listened to? We have 22 studies published in medical literature, all of which—100 per cent of those studies—find that ivermectin is a highly effective treatment for COVID. In fact, the chances that you would get 21 studies out of 21 studies are one in two million. So I call on our national evidence task force to look at the evidence, to look at these 21 studies. At the moment, on their website, they say they looked at one study and are basing their recommendation against this drug on that one study, when there are in fact 21 published studies. If you look at those 21 published studies, that drug must be recommended now to treat COVID patients, especially those Australians returning from overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third recommendation that the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce makes is on hydroxychloroquine. Again, it recommends against it. What's the evidence? We now have 118 published studies in medical literature, the majority of them peer reviewed, that find that hydroxychloroquine is effective. One of them—it was actually published here on 6 December—is a peer reviewed study in an internationally acclaimed journal titled the <span style="font-style:italic;">International Journal of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Antim</span><span style="font-style:italic;">icrobial Agents</span>. The highlights of this peer reviewed study say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Low-dose hydroxychloroquine combined with zinc and azithromycin was an effective therapeutic approach against COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Significantly reduced hospitalisation rates in the treatment group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By 'significantly', they mean a reduction of over 80 per cent. Yet our national evidence task force is ignoring the evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we had the statement of none other than Professor Peter A McCullough on the weekend in an Australian interview. You cannot get a gentleman with more qualifications and expertise than Peter A McCullough. He said: 'Make no bones about it, hydroxychloroquine really works. It is the most widely used therapeutic to treat COVID in the world, hands down. The chances that it doesn't work are calculated to be one in 17 billion. It is a very useful drug. It has been on the prescription market for 65 years. It is a very safe and effective medication.' He said, 'I think historians are going to be unkind to Australia, Canada and other nations' that have failed to prescribe it. He also notes that half of the lives that have been lost to COVID could have been saved if our medical bureaucrats would just look at the evidence.</span>

                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I rise tonight to firstly acknowledge the strong community spirit of locals in my electorate of Richmond as 2020 has been a very tough year for so many people in our region with the COVID-19 crisis, the job losses and the overall economic situation we're now in. Yet, through all these challenges, we've seen incredible generosity from locals, with so many of them reaching out to help each other. That's what makes the New South Wales North Coast such a great place to live. The commitment of locals to one another, to their families and to their community is truly inspirational.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our local businesses there have been so many challenges this year, and it's great to see many of our retail, tourism and hospitality businesses opening up their doors again. I will indeed keep continuing to call for more targeted assistance for our vital small businesses in our regions. They are the backbone of our local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank our incredible healthcare workers, our aged-care workers and our disability care workers. You've been at the frontline working so hard to protect everyone. We're very, very appreciative of all you've done supporting some of the most vulnerable members in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge and thank our police and emergency service workers for continuing to protect us all in these very, very difficult times. Thanks also to the charities, support services, community groups and our wonderful RSLs as well. I know you've all found ways to adapt and support your members throughout this crisis. Can I also acknowledge and thank those working in our local supermarkets, who did a remarkable job in extremely trying circumstances, especially at the start of the pandemic when there was so much widespread concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also been a very challenging year for our teachers, students and parents who all work so hard to make homeschooling possible. I know it's been very difficult, but your ability to adapt has, indeed, been inspiring as well. And I want to recognise all those HSC students—the class of 2020—who've now finished their exams after a very difficult year. You should be very proud of everything you've achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the pandemic first hit, one of the greatest concerns was for the seniors in our community, so I started the Community Care Calls. My team and I called over 12,000 seniors in the Richmond electorate. We were checking in and offering support to them. What was great to see was that so many local seniors had amazing support, either from their family members, their neighbours or the wider community. And of course many of those seniors were actually out there providing support to others. The strength, resilience and generosity of spirit exemplified by our senior Australians again is an inspiration to us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic situation that we're currently in greatly concerns many in my community. We need to do whatever can be done to keep local people in local jobs and support our local economies, and we still need the government to do much more. We need a proper jobs plan for the future for the regions, for the recovery, tailored towards the rebuilding. That focus must be on protecting jobs and keeping our businesses viable into the future. Indeed, it was Labor that called for the wage subsidies, and we did that because we knew how vitally important they'd be. The government finally agreed, but, still, so many were left behind, particularly those such as casuals when JobKeeper was announced. And, for areas like mine that rely on tourism, retail and hospitality, many of those casuals missed out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very fortunate on the North Coast to have an incredibly diverse and vibrant arts and entertainment sector, but many of those workers were left behind. The government did finally respond to Labor's calls for industry-specific support, but it's not enough. They still need more support in that vital area. I'll continue to call for more support for Southern Cross University in my region too, for specific assistance to ensure they remain viable and to provide tertiary opportunities for our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at any indicator, we see the impacts in the regions are massive. Indeed, we had some of the highest percentages of JobKeeper originally. We also had record numbers on youth allowance and JobSeeker, and we've repeatedly said that that rate of JobSeeker must be raised. Our regional economies need more support tailored to the needs of our area—a specific jobs plan, increased infrastructure investment, and greater education and training opportunities for our young people. The fact is that our regions matter, and this Liberal-National government must not leave our regions behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community has shown remarkable resilience over the last year, and I'll always continue to fight for them. Our community came together and supported one another, and I acknowledge and thank them for their commitment. They are incredible and inspirational.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Earlier this week, a spokesman from the Chinese foreign ministry tweeted a graphic, doctored and deeply disturbing image showing an Australian soldier holding a knife to an Afghan child. The Prime Minister rightly called it repugnant. I believe it is deeply offensive, a slap in the face to all Australians and an insult to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. Those on the other side of the House have, rightly, joined with the government in condemning this tweet. When asked to apologise, the Chinese government doubled down. These actions are disgusting. This childish and petty act from an official Twitter account makes me sick. The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of itself. This image is state sanctioned abuse. It is toxic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Monday, my office has received hundreds of letters, telephone calls and other pieces of correspondence condemning the position of the Chinese government and demanding that I speak on their behalf. We should not allow ourselves to be silent and let the Chinese government lecture us on issues of morality or justice. They have no right to comment on such issues—no right at all. This is not a reflection on the Chinese people or the 1.2 million Australians with Chinese heritage who have chosen to make Australia their home. Actions such as this tweet and the fake, falsified image undermine the Chinese government's credibility, their legitimacy and their integrity in the eyes of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year, China's Deputy Ambassador to Australia announced at the National Press Club that Beijing wanted a relationship marked by respect, goodwill, fairness and vision. This post represents none of those things. China says it wants to be considered a responsible and credible actor, but this tweet undermines China's credibility far more than it does Australia's. China says it wants to be Australia's mate. This isn't what mates do. The Chinese government is attempting to undermine and discredit the 26,000 Australians who served in Afghanistan with decency and honour. I myself served our nation in Afghanistan with pride. I met some of the civilian men and women and their children that this tweet is alleging we don't care about. I can tell you that, when these people saw Australian soldiers coming their way, they were relieved. They were glad to see us. They wanted to keep parts of our uniforms because they knew we were on their side. We, as Australians, won't be influenced by foreign propaganda or misinformation. We, as Australians, won't be intimidated by other nations. We are, and always will be, free from influence of foreign states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent IGADF inquiry demonstrates our nation's transparency and willingness to hold itself to account. The findings contain some very serious allegations. When we hear allegations of wrongdoing, we investigate them, so these allegations must be properly investigated and dealt with according to Australian law. But let's not forget: not one Australian soldier has been found guilty by an Australian court. They are all innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very fact that our ADF has held itself accountable and conducted an internal inquiry is commendable. I can't imagine seeing an inquiry like this being done out of a country like China. If the situation were reversed, could you imagine the Chinese People's Liberation Army holding a self-critical inquiry and holding themselves to account, let alone an Australian government department responding via a fabricated and disgusting tweet? I think Twitter has a case to answer for. The Chinese government does not allow its people to use Twitter, yet its government officials can to post falsified images. Why is this platform ignoring the calls for the images to be removed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community is the largest garrison city in the country, and I support our men and women who put on the uniform every day. I stand with the Prime Minister in calling for the Chinese government to immediately apologise to our ADF men and women.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Walking away from Labor's shadow cabinet was obviously not an easy decision for me. The reasons are many and obvious. The issue I want to speak to tonight is the impact on my staff. As a result of my decision, three people in my office lost the jobs they held with me. When I spoke at my press conference about my decision three weeks ago I had intended to speak about my shadow ministerial staff and pay tribute to them. Alas, the weight of the moment and the length of the press conference caused me to lose my way and I omitted to do so. So I want to do so tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank and pay tribute to Mark Abernethy and Kate Boyd, who served me loyally, energetically and very effectively for the last 18 months. But I also want to talk about my former chief of staff, Natasa Sikman, who worked with me for more than 10 years—first when I was Chief Government Whip, then a minister—albeit for a short time—and then, for a long period of time, shadow minister for agriculture and later the shadow minister for both agriculture and resources. In opposition you need people with agility and flexibility. In the top job you need an all-rounder, and Natasa Sikman was certainly that. I'm sure she'll be certainly that in a new job in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of that decade Natasa did media, administration, people management, stakeholder management, legislative management, policy development, parliamentary management and parliamentary tactics, and, of course, had to deal with the madness of her boss! Natasa built Labor's country caucus—one of her bigger achievements. She developed Labor's successful 2019 forestry policy—for the first time in many decades the industry rated Labor's forestry policy to be superior to that of those who now serve in the government—and she did so after extensive negotiation and consultation with industry and unions. It was a magnificent outcome for the party. In the Chief Government Whip's office, she managed to steer the Labor team—a minority government—through around two years without losing a single vote on the floor of the House of Representatives—again, no small achievement. I thank Natasa for her service, loyalty, guidance, advice, patience, skill and hard work. Natasa Sikman is a great loss to me and a great loss, I believe, to the Australian Labor Party. I wish her well and I wish her family well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I failed to do three weeks ago was acknowledge and thank the many industry stakeholders I've been engaged with for seven years as the shadow minister for agriculture and for a while as the minister for agriculture but also over the course of the last 18 months as the shadow minister for agriculture and resources. In the agriculture space there are too many to name, but obviously there are the National Farmers Federation; the state based farm groups; industry leaders; the investors themselves; all those in the value chain; all those who produce our food and fibre; our growers and producers; those who work in areas like crop protection, which aren't always obvious, and in animals and medicines, which are always obvious to the casual observer of the agriculture sector; environmental groups who are important stakeholders; and, of course, the trade union movement. In the resources sector: investors and executives in oil, gas and mining companies; the Minerals Council of Australia; the NSW Minerals Council; all those councils and peak groups in every state right around the country; organisations like APPEA and many more; and, of course, again, our great trade union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been very fortunate to have fantastic relationships with so many groups and so many people within those groups, and with so many people who work hard, both on the land and, of course, in our industries, like oil and gas and coal and in mining more generally. It's been a great journey for me. I thank them for their consultation and engagement, and I thank many of them, if not most of them—indeed, if not all of them—for their friendship. I make this commitment to both those in agriculture and in resources: Joel Fitzgibbon is going nowhere, and I will continue to be a very strong advocate on their behalf. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Thirty years ago this year, I was elected to this House. Joel Fitzgibbon's father, Eric, was there at the time. You can go, Joel. One thing I've learned over that time, from 1990 till now—not that I was a continuing member; in fact, I was a 'oncer' then, and I was a oncer twice, which is pretty hard to do—was that the least person in this House, the least person in this building, is crucial to the operations of the building. I also learned about the importance of those around us who help us to do the job. So, tonight, I want to pay respect to the Clerk, the Deputy Clerk and all their team for the work they've done, especially around COVID-19. To the Speaker and his team, who had to balance the constitutional requirements of the parliament against the onslaught of the pandemic: I congratulate you for keeping us safe and secure, and for allowing the parliament to run in the best possible manner that it could. I would like to acknowledge my own staff in this whole process. Everybody's had pressure way beyond what they've probably experienced in their lives before, because of this crisis. My thanks to Tony, Ashlee, Alex, Julie, Jenny, Vanessa and Tanya. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House: you have my utmost respect. This is a hard place to get into, it's an easy place to get thrown out of and you have a heavy responsibility for the wellbeing of the Australian people, and I know that is in the hearts of every member who comes into this House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thanks go to my Privileges Committee secretariat, who are a fountain of wisdom and who enabled us to carry on our commitments to the committee in a way that only such knowledge and ability to do their jobs allowed; to the library staff of the parliament; to Warren and the catering staff; to our COMCAR drivers and the Reps transport team; to the cleaners; to the maintenance staff who keep the building going; and to the gardeners who have those golden green thumbs that have turned this place into a work of art in the outside and inside areas. My thanks to the ministerial staff, who have been so great to work with on issues surrounding our constituencies, where our community needs all the help it can get—and they deliver it. I hesitate to nominate one person, but I do want to mention Bronwyn Morris in the Prime Minister's Office, who has the discernment and the experience to know what's important and what's not. My thanks to my family, who support the role that I do in every aspect. If I go to the broader community, like the member for Richmond, I'm not going to mention all the frontline workers, but I especially acknowledge our childcare and aged-care workers who, through this whole process, were considering the most vulnerable and the most needy. My heart goes out to them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't walked into this place at any time over the last 30 years and not known that it's a privilege and an honour to serve in this House on behalf of the Australian people. The year 2020 has probably been one of the most difficult years that a nation could face. But, together, this nation put its shoulder to the wheel, and 2020 shone the brightest light on our reliance on each other for our personal and national wellbeing. It was a year like no other—and, God willing, never again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  Investment in social and public housing should be a no-brainer, particularly at this time. It is good for the economy as a stimulus, it is good for jobs and it is really good for the people who need affordable housing and for people who are homeless. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquiry into homelessness. I'm really pleased that the Youth2 Alliance from Frankston and Mornington Peninsula have made a submission, because we have a real issue with youth homelessness and the lack of crisis accommodation for young people who are homeless. It is federal Labor's policy to invest in social and public housing and to fix up the state of public housing across the country. The Victorian state Labor government has announced an amazing $5.3 billion for public and social housing in our state. So, along with Youth2 Alliance, I will be fighting for some of that money to be delivered in our community, particularly for our young people who need it. But we've heard nothing from the federal government about any intention to invest more in social and public housing, and it's really not good enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Youth2 Alliance have told the House of Representatives social policy committee, we need locality based and coordinated options for young people: early intervention, access to emergency responses and transition out of homelessness pathways. Unfortunately, we don't have that at the moment at a level that is necessary in the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula region. We'll keep fighting for it, because we know that nine out of 10 of homeless young people report that they've seen violence at home, more than half of them have left home on one occasion because of violence between parents or guardians and 41 per cent of young people who participated in a recent survey presented alone to specialist homelessness services because of a mental health issue. We have to do more for young people in Australia now and for their futures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my region, the number of young people turning up to specialist homelessness services for help has increased by more than 50 per cent during the COVID period. Housing is seriously unaffordable. We know that Australia has a shortfall of about 300,000 social and public rentals in Australia. In Victoria, the waitlist is about 83,000. We must do more. The Victorian state Labor government is doing more. Federal Labor is committed to doing more there. There are amazing homelessness services and advocates across the country who are committed to doing more. We need the federal government to do more. I urge them to look at the recommendations in the Youth2 Alliance submission to social policy committee inquiry and to adopt them. We need the national cabinet to push for social housing funding to be not just a state matter but also a federal matter. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MARTIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  I rise today to discuss the impact of muscular dystrophy and neuromuscular conditions, a group of inherited neuromuscular disorders that cause irreversible weakness and wasting of the muscles. I recently spoke with Charlotte Sangster, the CEO of Muscular Dystrophy NSW, located in Lidcombe, just outside of my electorate. Charlotte is working with families in Reid and around New South Wales to better support those living with the condition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Muscular Dystrophy NSW, there are approximately 24,600 Australians living with a neuromuscular condition. A child who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy gradually loses the ability to sit up, move their limbs, walk and, tragically, breathe. I recently attended a briefing, hosted by the Parliamentary Friends of Child and Adolescent Health, that examined Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a specific type of muscular dystrophy that affects one in every 3,500 male children. Tragically, boys who develop Duchenne muscular dystrophy are not expected to live past their 20s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another rare condition is facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, known as FSHD. Symptoms, tragically, begin in early childhood and become noticeable in the teenage years. I recently met with Natalie Cooney, the chairperson of the FSHD Global Research Foundation, to better understand the challenges of this condition. The driving force behind this organisation is the director, Bill Moss, who was born with FSHD but only discovered this at the age of 27. The former Macquarie executive director is now on the search for a cure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While all of these neuromuscular conditions differ in presentation and diagnosis, the impact on individuals and families affected is the same. They are all devastated by a rare, incurable disorder that takes too many lives too soon. Many of the families that are seeking to better manage the impacts of muscular dystrophy are active participants of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. An appropriate NDIS plan can make the world of difference for individuals with a severe disability and for their families, giving them greater flexibility, choice and quality of life. The Morrison government's commitment of a further $3.9 billion for the NDIS in the 2020 budget should bring these families confidence that practical support is available. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Still, more needs to be done to progress and help with screening, diagnosis and treatment and, ultimately, to find cures for muscular dystrophy disorders. I want to commend those organisations that I've recently met with who are working in the community and in medical research to help address the impacts of muscular dystrophy and neuromuscular conditions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  In many communities there are individuals who go over and above the normal because they love doing what they do. I would like to take a moment to congratulate a great man and champion of the Australian spirit, Geoff Jackson, a member of the Bridgewater community, who, at 69—and far from out—just umpired his 700th cricket match in a match between Old Beach and Collinsvale. In the area they simply refer to Geoff as Jacko. Jacko began his journey as an umpire in the Derwent Valley in 1997 before moving to the Southern Cricket Association in 2001. Geoff took up the role of umpire due to the shortage of officials in the 1990s, and he has not looked back. For the past six years, he's been the Southern Cricket Association's umpire adviser. When Jacko was asked if he had any retirement plans, he said, 'I'll go a couple more years yet, I reckon.' Asked if he could get to 1,000 matches, he said, 'It's not out of the picture.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jacko also has another passion, as president of the Brighton Show. This annual event, except of course for this year, sees 30,000 people flock to the area for one of the best rural shows in Tasmania. Geoff and I worked very closely on the funding application for the Regional Agricultural Show Development Grants, announced by the government earlier this year. The government at the time inexplicably said that Brighton didn't meet the criteria because, apparently, it's not in a rural area. Anybody who's been to the Brighton Show knows that it is a pre-eminent agricultural event and that there's plenty of country in Brighton. After lobbying the Deputy Prime Minister, we had the criteria waived—and I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for that—and we were successful in getting $70,000 for a new animal shelter area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to be said that Geoff Jackson has a ripping mo, as you'd expect from a cricketing legend. It's not as good as Boony's and not as up there as Merv Hughes's, but it is a ripper to say the least. He is a true cricket legend. It is men and women like Geoff Jackson that keep our community spirit alive. As we creep closer to Christmas, after what's been a very difficult year for many people, we need that community spirit more than ever. I encourage people to get out to their local cricket club and watch a match or two. If you see Jacko umpiring a game, give him the raspberry and question his ability to see better than your grandmother. The response will be entertaining—but, unfortunately, unprincipled! </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  'Never give in' is the lesson of Teddy Sheean VC's final act of bravery aboard the sinking HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> 78 years ago off the coast of Timor. 'Never give in' is the lesson that we should take from the efforts of those many Australians who fought over the years to have Teddy Sheean recognised with the Victoria Cross. Yesterday, 78 years to the day since the death of Ordinary Seaman Sheean and the loss of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span>, the Governor-General presented the VC to Teddy Sheean's family at Government House. This was a great day for all Australians, and we can be immensely proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sacrifice is at the very heart of our civic culture. It is the reason that we recognise our service men and women every April 25th, and we pause at 11 am on 11 November of every year to recognise the time when the guns fell silent on the Western Front more than 100 years ago. Teddy Sheean VC exemplifies sacrifice and exemplifies service to others, and we can all picture him at the end covering his mates, with fire blazing away at the Japanese aircraft above, so they could live. He was willing to lay down his life to make that happen. Tasmanians are rightly very proud of Teddy Sheean, and they should be—he is a great Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Western Australians also share in the pride that Tasmanians have not just because we're Australians as well but because Teddy Sheean was there that day on 1 December 1942 off the coast of Timor to evacuate members of the 2/2nd Independent Company, which was a commando unit that had fought an almost year-long guerilla campaign against the Japanese in Timor. Eighty per cent of the unit was drawn from Western Australia. It was Teddy Sheean, with the Royal Australian Navy, who was there to pick them up and give them a ride home. And Teddy Sheean died doing just that. In my view, it's a beautiful picture of Australian federation at work on the battlefield.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a year like 2020, where our federation has been under immense strain, it's great to go back to historical examples like this one and recognise that, yes, we are proud of our state identities but that, in the end, we are all Australians and, on the battlefield, we don't make any distinctions. So Western Australians shared in the joy of seeing Teddy Sheean recognised yesterday at Government House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me finish by reading the final part of his citation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ordinary Seaman Sheean's actions disrupted and distracted the enemy from strafing and killing his defenceless shipmates in the water. He sacrificed his life trying to save his shipmates and, despite his wounds, he continued firing the gun until the ship sank and took him to his death. … His heroism became the standard to which the men and women of the Australian Defence Force aspire.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  I want to pay tribute today to the extraordinary teachers, educators and school leaders working so hard right now across Fraser and to all the work that they have contributed throughout this year. This has been a year like no other. The impact has been felt in workplaces and within families around Australia, but it has been especially profound in Victoria and in communities like Fraser. I acknowledge that, after a long and challenging year, this week marks the end of the VCE and VET examination period for thousands of students. In fact, the final exam was Italian, held yesterday afternoon. Notwithstanding the fact that I was born in Italy, I would have failed it badly, making me the black sheep of the family. But that is another issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I particularly thank all the year 11 and year 12 students who have done so much incredible work through remote and virtual education that enabled VCE students to feel as supported and confident as possible as they've tackled their exams. In the meetings I've been able to hold by Zoom this year with students and teachers, I've heard how year 12 students have overcome so many of the challenges that this year has posed. In doing so, they've shown great independence and resilience and have built up their capacity to achieve academically and more generally in their lives. On behalf of the Fraser community and, I'm sure, all the members of this House, I wish every success to Fraser's VCE, VET and VCAL students both as they await their results and in the opportunities that await them in their lives to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year has had a huge impact on students of all ages. My daughter completed a disrupted prep this year, and I saw firsthand how much teachers and other staff working in schools had to invest in building remote learning facilities from scratch and adjusting their teaching practices in order to provide students with the support that they needed. To all of the teachers in Fraser, thank you for the incredible contribution you make in our community, especially amid the extraordinary circumstances that we've confronted this year. I'm full of admiration for the way in which teachers at government, Catholic and independent schools have pivoted adeptly between remote and onsite learning, often at short notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the experience of remote learning has highlighted some of the deficiencies in this government's communication policies. My office received many calls from families who were struggling with slow internet speeds and NBN connections which hadn't yet taken effect. More than ever this year has highlighted the importance of delivering outstanding educational opportunities to all Australian children, especially in communities like mine in the outer suburbs where Labor's extra investment in schools would have made such a huge difference. As this academic year draws to a close and restrictions finally ease, I look forward to meeting again with students, teachers and principals and to announcing the winners of the inauguration Fraser young leaders awards.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  I acknowledge the bravery of a special group of Royal Australian Air Force airmen during the Battle of Long Tan in South Vietnam in 1966. This battle saw 108 Australian soldiers from D Company, 6RAR Battalion fighting enormous odds to defeat an estimated 2½ thousand Viet Cong in one of the bravest Australian engagements of the war. The courage of the D Company soldiers, led by their commander Major Harry Smith, is undisputed. I was pleased to see their bravery officially acknowledged in 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Less public attention has been given to the significant actions of two RAAF crews who assisted D Company. On that fateful day on 18 August 1966, two RAAF helicopters were five kilometres away from Long Tan, transporting a group of entertainers to safety at Vung Tau. While the RAAF crews carried out this task, the situation for D Company became dire and the troops surrounded by the Viet Cong were running low on ammunition. Major Smith made an urgent request for more ammunition, but a tropical monsoon meant that visibility was almost zero. This, along with the uncertainty of the enemy situation, meant the resupply mission was extremely dangerous. The RAAF helicopters were under order not to be sent on offensive operations and US helicopters were unavailable for back-up. But, when the airmen were alerted to D Company's plight, Flight Lieutenant Francis Riley, known as Frank Riley, offered to go in spite of the regulations. The crews, accompanied by some Army soldiers, were quick to support him and loaded up two RAAF Iroquois with ammunition. Taking off in falling light in a monsoonal downpour, the A2-1020 was flown by Flight Lieutenant Frank Riley, with co-pilot, Robert Grandin, and crew, Leading Aircraftman David Collins, Corporal George Stirling, Warrant Officer George Ernest Chinn, and Major Owen O'Brien. In an A2-1022, piloted by the Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Bruce Lane, were a crew of Corporal William Harrington and Leading Aircraftman Brian Hill, Aircraftmen Robert Service and Corporal William Raymond McKutchen. Hovering about the D Company's position at 20 to 30 feet, they were sitting ducks for the enemy and could barely make out the rubber trees as they pushed crates of ammunition out of the helicopters. But for their actions, the day could have been remembered as an Australian military disaster. Instead, it is known as a decisive victory. Like many who served, these men have not received formal recognition for their courage on that day, so today I wish to acknowledge them so that others will remember their bravery.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  Like many Australians, the thought of having my family together for Christmas has kept me going through this hard year of isolation and separation. But, for hundreds of my constituencies whose family members are stranded overseas, this thought is as far away as possible. Over the last few months, dozens of people have contacted my office pleading for help to secure a flight home. There is Marg, a 74-year-old intrepid adventurer from Bright. When she visited Canada for a six-week holiday in February, she could never would have guessed she would be there for eight months, with her flight cancelled and her mental and financial resolve starting to crumble. I'm happy to say we have Marg home now. Jim's sister got stuck in India after one of her regular trips abroad for charity work. She was driven to desperate measures to secure a flight. Happily, she's now home and will be reunited with her family this week. Tony, from Benalla, has a 27-year-old daughter and she and her partner tried time and time again to leave the UK in the face of increasing case numbers. Happily, she's now home safe too. But these constituents say the government must be more proactive in getting people home safe and sound. They ask me, quite frankly: 'Where was the government when we needed them?' In the end, these stories are good news stories, but these people had resources and family members who could advocate on their behalf, but what about the Australians who don't have this support? The number of Australians stuck overseas classified as vulnerable, experiencing financial stress or with disability or mental ill-health has doubled since September to now over 8,000 people. A central role of government is to support its isolated and vulnerable citizens overseas. With the coronavirus pandemic raging in the Northern Hemisphere, this is becoming more urgent day by day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to do more to get our families and friends home. The closure of our international borders has also impacted the labour market in Indi, with agriculture, tourism, hospitality and accommodation sectors struggling to find employees. Many people on working holiday or skilled visas left at the start of the pandemic. To say we could just get school leavers to pick fruit completely misunderstands the important role this migrant workforce plays in our regional economy. And then there are the people on partner visas who need to be offshore to receive their visas, but who are not permitted to leave the country or have no guarantees that they can return. I won't pretend these are easy problems to solve, but we need to urgently find solutions such as what has been put forward in the government's own review on quarantine. To the Australians stuck overseas, desperate to see their families by Christmas: we have not forgotten you; we will get you home eventually.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  One of the great things that unites communities is sport, and in the past week or so, in partnership with the Logan City Council, the federal government has announced a $644,000 investment through the Driving Social Inclusion through Sport and Physical Activity Program. In partnership with Logan City Council, this is focused around swimming skills. One of the reasons this is really important in Logan is the City of Logan is a truly diverse community with over 217 cultures represented, and one of the best ways for those various cultures to get involved in our community is through sports and physical activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The grant will allow for free swimming lessons over the next two years for refugee, migrant, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people older than 16. This will not only help efforts to reduce drowning rates but also offer the participants the chance to make friends and feel a sense of and be a part of our community. The focus of the adult swimming lessons is important because children generally at school today have swim lessons through school, whereas adults have limited ability to take those swimming lessons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Logan City Council for its initiative to put in place the Logan swim program. In addition to providing the free swimming lessons, it also offers free transport and supervised activities for the children to support their parents' access to these sessions. The sense of joy and happiness that people get from sport was on full display at the classes I saw last week at the Gould Adams Park Aquatic Centre. The students all looked as if they were having a hugely enjoyable time being in the water together; and although it might have been helped by the fact that it was a typical hot summer's day in Queensland, it was a fantastic example of the value of these types of programs. The program is provided by bilingual swim teachers and also offers first aid and CPR training. Importantly, it also offers opportunities for participants to upskill as pool instructors, which is expected to provide future employment pathways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal Lifesaving research shows that most drownings occur in the summer months and that the risk of drowning increases during public and summer holidays. Coming into the holiday season, it's especially important to see these programs up and running, and it's fantastic to see our migrant, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities gaining the confidence to enjoy an active lifestyle that we all enjoy in this beautiful country of ours.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  Last week I hosted an online forum for young people in my electorate and I heard from a diverse and amazing group of people with different cultural backgrounds, interests and goals but all ready to take their place in the world and looking for a path to a future. Two main themes emerged in the discussion: young people in Parramatta are worried about finding secure employment; and young people want their voices to be heard by government and decision-makers. If any group in our society at the moment should be heard, it's young people, the people whose lives will be different than yours and mine, who will live in a world with different employment relationships, different community relationships, different global engagements, completely different than the world we lived in. They're ready for that world and ready to take their place. By not listening to them and providing a space for them, we waste an extraordinary opportunity to rebuild this country in the way it needs to be for these people in the future that they will live in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met a young woman called Fibha, a university graduate who lost her job at the beginning of the pandemic. Despite her qualifications, when she went to a job services provider, she was told to apply for pick-and-pack roles. There's nothing wrong with packing boxes—I've done it and many of us probably have—but Fibha wants to use the skills she has worked so hard to obtain to make a contribution to society, and she left those meetings feeling that the job services provider had no interest at all in matching her to a job that was suited to her skills and qualifications. She felt really let down and she felt there were no opportunities for young people like her to raise their concerns beyond the organisation itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're looking for an organisation that really does work with young people where they are and prepare them for life ahead, it's an organisation called batyr. It's a not-for-profit organisation that works to break down the stigma around mental health and encourages young people to have honest conversations about mental health. It has been running a pilot program in Western Sydney and the Central Coast funded under the department of industry's Youth Employment Innovation Challenge in 2018, but its funding is almost at an end. It ends in November, and there is no guarantee of further funding. I just want to point out that this program is incredibly successful for young people aged 15 to 24. It has a workshop and then it pairs them with a mentor and it really makes a difference. It's twice as effective as the jobactive service in getting people back into jobs or training. It has a 59 per cent success rate compared to a 26 per cent success rate, and it's cheaper at $1,500 per participant. For $1,500 with this wonderful organisation called batyr, 59 per cent of young people end up back in work or studying. What an extraordinary result. I really urge the government to consider how they might keep funding this program.</span>

In what has been an extremely challenging year for many, I'd like to recognise the efforts of this year's winners across 13 categories. The Senior Sportsperson of the Year went to Mitch Christiansen, who won three silver medals at the New South Wales Athletics Para Championships. The Masters Sports Award went to Laurelea Moss, who won two gold medals at the National Cyclist Masters, where she was named Women's Champion of Champions. Junior Male Sportsperson of the Year went to Hayden Ensbey, a great local cricketer and rugby league player. Junior Female Sportsperson of the Year went to Andrea Thomson, an outstanding swimmer, who recently broke eight South Grafton High records. Andrea also won the People's Choice Award. The Holly Butcher Memorial Volunteer of the Year went to Tim Ryan for his work across several Lower Clarence sporting groups and organisations for the past 25 years. Club of the Year went to the Harwood Cricket Club, who were the Lower Clarence premiers this year. Team of the Year went to the Grafton Tigers AFL seniors, who, after claiming the wooden spoon two years in a row, this year won their first match in 1,183 days, with a 17-point victory, and went on to win the major and minor premierships. Coach of the Year went to Adi Campbell, who took the Grafton Tigers from last to first in a single season. The Ernie Muller Award for Contribution to Sport in the Lower Clarence went to Matt Farrell, who is currently the Maclean Footy Club president, Lower Clarence Bowling Club director, Lower Clarence Sports Council representative and Iluka Cricket Club treasurer. The Max Godbee Award for Contribution to Sport in the Clarence Valley went to Ken Maughan, who is the Grafton Rowing Club captain, with a history in sport dating back almost 60 years. Sports Contributor of the Year went to Don Freeman and Contributing Sports Photographer of the Year went to Gary Nichols. I'd like to also acknowledge Bill North and his organising committee for putting the event together.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge St Brigid's Primary School in Kyogle, who recently won the national Reconciliation Story Award and the Best Cultural History Story Award in the Wakakirri competition. Through the program, schools like St Brigid's create a 'story-dance' using a combination of dancing, creative movement and acting to music. St Brigid's could not have made the performance without the guidance of local Aboriginal elders Uncle Wayne and Aunty Vera Walker. St Brigid's story represented the impact of the bushfires in the past year as well as traditional perspectives on learning and land management practices. Uncle Wayne and Aunty Vera's granddaughter Tahnesha was also in the production. The school used the 'Gondwana Dreaming' music by Steven Bond. Congratulations to the 67 students involved, from kindergarten through to year 6, who gave up many lunchtimes to practise their performance. Also a massive congratulations and thanks to the Indigenous education worker, Sonja McNab; facilitator Hayley Kennedy; coordinator Till Beetge; and community member and mother Emma Rixon. And thank you to St Brigid's for representing our region so proudly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:44</span>):  Today is the 48th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government on 2 December 1972. Whitlam, as the member for Werriwa, said at that election, 'I do not for one moment believe that we should set limits on what we can achieve together for our country, our people or our future.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, that sentiment is not something I see when I look at the support for the people of South-West Sydney now in the electorate that I have the honour to represent. Many of the legacies from that time and that government are under threat. The passing of the legislation in this place yesterday to merge the federal and family courts is just the latest example. Since the housing developments of the 1960s, people have been moving into our region for the promise of a better life and cheaper housing. But unlike the 1960s, when parks, public schools and public transport facilities were built to meet population demand, today that dream remains constantly unfulfilled. Patient residents wait for roads to be built, schools to be provided and transport links to be planned. It now takes longer on a train from Liverpool to the Sydney CBD than it did in 1980, when most of the rolling stock were red rattlers. These carriages had uncomfortable seats and they were freezing in winter and boiling in summer—but at least they were built in Australia and they were fit for purpose. Recent purchases of rolling stock from overseas by the Liberal state government had to be completely remodelled because they didn't fit in tunnels. Then we had ferries that don't allow you to sit on the top deck for fear of losing your head under bridges. It beggars belief that governments actually accepted these mistakes or were so slipshod that contracts did not make the proper stipulations. But this is, of course, the same political party that at a federal level gave us a defence minister who said that he wouldn't trust Australians to build a canoe. Unlike the Liberals, I believe our trains, ferries and other infrastructure should be manufactured here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday the New South Wales Legislative Council tabled their report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Current and future provision of health services in the South-West Sydney Growth Region</span>. Following an extensive inquiry, the report found that health services in South-West Sydney are underfunded and underresourced. The South-West Sydney area health district covers the local government areas of Liverpool, Canterbury-Bankstown, Fairfield, Campbelltown, Camden and Wollondilly, and it is serviced by Liverpool, Fairfield and Campbelltown hospitals. Just over one million people live and work in the area covered by the health district. It is a diverse community with a higher than average birth rate due to the large number of young families in the area. There is an unmet need in maternity, mental health and other services. Fifty-one per cent of people in the area speak a language other than English at home. The committee found that current funding does not provide an equitable or transparent model to ensure that the people who live in our region get their fair share of services they require. The provision of those services is often hampered because of the significant number of people who require translation support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report also highlighted that services are further impacted because of economic disadvantage. The rates of private health insurance in our region are much lower. Less than 38 per cent of households have private health insurance. The state average is 51.5 per cent. This puts further strain on public services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next 10 years there will be significant growth around the new Western Sydney airport. A new city, the Aerotropolis, will be built to service and benefit from the airport. But the committee's report highlights the need for land for the Aerotropolis to be secured now to provide health services for the burgeoning population growth expected. Cities require housing, commercial, retail and industrial properties, but they also require hospitals and other health services. The recommendations deal with the chronic understaffing of nurses, doctors and other specialists. There's a lack of after-hours service for operating theatres, radiology and ultrasound services and GP clinics. All of this puts an increasingly unbearable burden on overworked emergency departments and their staff. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My frustration is that nothing has really changed for some time. It was the Wran and Whitlam governments of the 1970s who recognised that health services should be where people lived. They built Westmead Hospital. The first of the upgrades to Liverpool Hospital was due to another Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But health is not the only area that sees underfunding and lack of planning. Edmondson Park has no public school. Many public schools in my area are 140 per cent over capacity. Five-year-olds are being sent on a more than six-kilometre trip to school every day. That, of course, makes a mockery of the 'get your children to walk to school' campaign. Edmondson Park will wait at least another three years before a school is built. That's simply not good enough for the thousands of families who were promised in glossy brochures they would have everything they needed. It took several years of community action and pressure to finally see the building of a community parking station at Edmondson Park railway station. And whilst that is better late than never, Macquarie Fields Station still doesn't have a lift despite the campaign that has gone on for many years. Young families or mobility-impaired commuters who can't negotiate the 82 steps are simply unable to get the train there. I recently met with residents and the state member for Macquarie Fields, Anoulack Chanthivong, at the station. While there, we saw a young family having to carry their baby in a pram up and down those stairs when they got off the train. This is neither optimal nor safe but, if you're older, it's impossible to negotiate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South-west Sydney and the residents of Werriwa were dealt another blow in August when the New South Wales government decided to put a new toll on an old road, the M5 East. In addition to countless emails and phone calls, I've received over 3,000 responses to my petition to stop the toll. This is causing genuine hardship to residents and businesses in Werriwa. Charles from Hinchinbrook is one of those people who has been hit by the greedy and unfair toll. He works for Qantas at Sydney Airport and has used the M5 East for his daily commute for several years. He hasn't had to pay a single cent to use the motorway until now. In an average working week, he's now slugged an additional $140. Charles tells me that travelling times have not improved, so it's a $6,000-a-year toll for nothing in return, and that toll is going to increase four per cent every year. It's unfair and another burden to struggling families in south-west Sydney. The message from residents and businesses is clear: the new toll on an old road is daylight robbery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we come to the NBN. Australia's digital infrastructure has been critical to ensuring our economy and society continue to function as efficiently as the pandemic will allow. However, this government does not take away from the continuing failures by the coalition government over seven years. I, like many, have conducted consultations, meetings, webinars and personal calls to family and friends that wouldn't have been possible without the NBN. In 2013, the coalition government promised to spend no more than $30 billion on a now admitted inferior national broadband network. This year the government acknowledged its own policy failure and made changes to the rollout. The new plan will retrofit the NBN, reflecting Labor's original plan, which I add, would now, had it continued, have been completed in over 99 per cent of Australian households and at a lower cost. The true tragedy of the failure is not only the cost to taxpayers but the cost of frustration and stress for my constituents and those across Australia. There are still residents in Werriwa who cannot link to the NBN and who are using expensive mobile data so they can work from home or complete school assignments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have already had to wait seven years for an inferior NBN they pay too much for and now they're being asked to be patient for another four years for something they should have already had. These are just a few failures that affect the people of Werriwa. There are, of course, many more—I note the Leppington Triangle, ICare and sports rorts. But, regardless of the level of government they emanate from, they all point to the same thing: ideology that sees the price of everything and the value of nothing, a culture that fetes mates and donors over those more deserving, a form of public administration that prefers spin and public relations instead of actually governing, and the people of Werriwa and the south-west are worse off because of it. We need governments who work for the people and who provide support and build infrastructure, education and health care.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:54</span>):  Following a number of thwarted attempts, in March 2015 the government called for voluntary nominations of land on which to establish a national radioactive waste management facility. I raised the possibility of this being well sited in my home town—in fact, on my own farm—in April 2015. The process came about after the failure of the Muckaty Station proposal, following the failure of an earlier proposal in South Australia, and after an independent inquiry, which included conservationists and people from other sides of politics, recommended that the Australian government should pursue voluntary nomination of private land for the establishment of this facility and, following that process, work out where the most likely site was. So, as I said, I brought it up in my home town in early 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important thing for the Australian nation. The OPAL reactor—and, before that, HIFAR at Lucas Heights—provides nuclear medicine for Australians on a daily basis. It provides around 12,000 doses a week at the moment. The establishment of the OPAL reactor was a very forward-thinking move by the Howard government, though it met with some opposition at the time. Not only does it provide that medication for Australians and assistance to industry and other things but it also provides for a growing export trade because some other countries in the world have not had the courage to get on and do the same thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Lucas Heights was established, the residents of Lucas Heights were guaranteed that it would only be for temporary storage of the low-level waste and that a permanent repository would be found. The other issue with Lucas Heights is that it's running out of room. I've been there, as have many citizens of Kimba. It's interesting that the waste that we're talking about largely sits in 44-gallon drums or 200-litre drums. It is unsealed, the workers do not wear protective clothing and they can work in that facility for around 10 years before they get the equivalent radiation of one CT scan. It's not incredibly dangerous and it's not incredibly difficult to look after, but we need to find a repository. In addition, there are over 100 sites around Australia where this sits in hospitals—we say over 100, because we don't actually know how many there are; I suspect it is closer to 300—in basements that are unlicensed and not specifically designed for this purpose. So it is imperative that we get on with the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the process was undertaken and the bill to nominate the Kimba site and get on with the job has been through the House of Representatives and now sits on the Senate <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>—and I'll come to that a little bit more in a moment. I've had a delegation in here in the last two days trying to make sure that it passes through the Senate. I thank those people who have made their time available to us, including the Leader of the Opposition, Anthony Albanese, and the shadow minister responsible, Brendan O'Connor. We also met with a number of Independents and we met with the Prime Minister. But I have to say that I'm really disappointed, particularly in the Labor Party, in that they are clinging to some kind of commitment to the legislation they passed in 2012 which they say is sufficient to establish the radioactive waste management facility. That legislation includes a whole lot of references to the Northern Territory because, at that stage, they thought that it was going to Muckaty Station. It also includes references to the payments that go to community, which are now completely out of date and not what has been promised to the successful community. So it needs to be amended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Labor Party and some of the crossbenchers are saying is that, under the current legislation, the minister can declare the establishment of the site. But, because they are not prepared to allow the site to be named in the legislation, that will allow that to be open to judicial review at every stage. That means that any person, any body and any organisation in Australia can announce that they have an interest and then challenge. I've already made up a list of 10 conservation groups that are on the record as opposing this facility. If we go down this pathway, this process that has now been running for over five years will go for another five years. It will extend the process in my home town of Kimba, which has actually ticked all the boxes and said, 'We are prepared to host this site.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I come to my home town and community of Kimba. I gave a speech in the second reading debate on this bill when it came through the House which set out my involvement in this process. It's a community with about 1,050 people. We had a population in the late eighties of close to 2,000; it was 1,900. We're seeing a continual decline in population across the agricultural regions. That's because of the efficiency of modern agriculture. It's not a bad story; it's a good story. But it is a story that leads to smaller and smaller towns on a continual basis. Once you get to a certain tipping point, then your health services are under threat and your school is under threat; the shops that actually make this a liveable place are under threat. Kimba hasn't got to that point yet, but we're not so far away from it. We've seen towns around us disappear, basically. We need to attract a new industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After this was raised in 2015, the Kimba community went through a survey. We've been through two full plebiscites to vote on this position. We've had three Senate inquiries. It has been ticked off and approved at every level, yet the Labor Party are still resistant to allowing this to go ahead. It seems as though they want to extend the pain. Not for one minute do I come into this place and say this hasn't been a difficult debate in Kimba or that people have not found it difficult. I can take you to the site of a proposed wind farm and give you the same kinds of difficulties or the proposed site of a new port that people don't want or whatever—it's the same type of thing. These things happen in communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The net result is that the last community ballot that we had, which had an over-90 per cent turnout, showed that 61.58 per cent of people voted in favour of hosting this facility. Now that's in the same area that the same-sex marriage debate was decided at a national level, and that was a landslide. I can show you any number of clippings that'll tell you that that was a landslide. So this is a landslide in Kimba; we want the facility. Yet we are now being frustrated, or it seems as though we're going to be frustrated. I'm still hopeful that some senators will come around and we'll get this legislation through the Senate this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important to note that we have some really strong individuals who have nominated their land. They have nominated their land because they want a future for their children in the Kimba community. They want their grandchildren to be able to get jobs in the Kimba community, because our greatest export, after wheat perhaps—or perhaps before wheat—is our children. They need opportunities for employment. They were brought up in a great community. They were brought up in a good school. But then they have to leave the community to go and find work elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This facility brings with it 45 jobs. It brings with it an annual investment for the community of around a million dollars, depending on how we manage it. And it will bring $8 million worth of activity into the community per year. It is a lifeline for a community like Kimba. It could have been anywhere in Australia, but this is the one population that has been brave enough to stand up and have the debate, internally and externally. Let me tell you: there are a lot of brave warriors on the keyboards out there, giving advice from Sydney, Melbourne and overseas, and signing hundreds of names on petitions, even if they don't live in Australia. There is plenty of advice coming from people outside, but how about we respect the decision of the people in Kimba? They've spent 5½ years discussing this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had every expert available in Australia come and visit. We've had mayors from communities in other nations come and tell us how fabulous these facilities are for their communities. We've had scientists at every level speak to us. We've had geologists, nuclear scientists and medical scientists speak to us. It is backed at every level. The nation needs it. We need to get on with the job because, if we extend this process at Kimba for another four or five years, we might lose it, and we would have to go back 40 years—because Paul Keating proposed this in the first place—and start all over again. If this parliament frustrates this community's will, when they have ticked every box, done everything that was required of them and actually got over the line and said, 'We will do it,' what other community would ever again put up their hand for this only to have the parliament then say, 'You can't'?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:04</span>):  On Monday a bad year got even worse for thousands of employees of Qantas, many of whom live in the community that I represent. Some 2,000 Qantas workers and their families were given the bad news that they would lose their jobs, but in the ultimate insult, the work that they did would be given to a foreign corporation and their workers would be paid lower wages and conditions to take the jobs of those Australian workers. It comes on the back of only a month ago 6,000 jobs going in what used to be our proud national airline. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those employees that lost his job on Monday is a fellow that lives in our community called Darren Lenton. He'd been stood down from his job as a leading hand at Qantas, where he had worked for 24 years—24 years of loyal service to Qantas. Darren has no leave left because he has to care for his ageing father, who has dementia. He's recently had to sell his house because the mortgage holiday the bank had given him had ended. That meant that Darren has had to move in with his mum and dad at La Perouse, along with his children, aged 14 and nine. And now he's been sacked by Qantas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just how low can Qantas go? They are sacking frontline workers like Darren and giving up employees that have given so much to keep Qantas flying during these difficult times. Qantas has indicated that it intends to replace those workers with others from a foreign corporation on lower wages and conditions. It's corporate immorality at its worse. All of this is after taking $800 million of taxpayers' funds and using the pandemic as cover for their long-term plan to try and weaken the unions and weaken wages and conditions for workers in their airline. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Qantas was once a national carrier that we could all be proud of. But the current management of Qantas are set on destroying the livelihoods of many of their workers while they continue to take the JobKeeper wage subsidies. It's shameful that it's come to this for Qantas. JobKeeper was put in place as a wage subsidy. It's meant to protect jobs. It's not there for corporations to exploit it for their own means and to bring in their ideal industrial relations system which cuts wages and conditions for workers. Qantas, in selling off Australian workers' jobs, isn't doing the right thing not only by their workforce but by the Australian people and the Australian government that put in place the JobKeeper program to protect those Australian workers' jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My old father worked at Qantas for 34 years. It was a good, stable job that provided for our family. He was very proud of the fact that he worked for our national airline. But after Qantas's actions, like many Australians he is no longer proud of what this airline has become. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month was the 100th anniversary of Qantas being established, but any sense of celebration has been overshadowed by the harsh reality for some of the current workers that they have been cast aside by the airline. Our aviation workers should be proud of helping Qantas reach its centenary, but many are struggling to survive. I pay tribute to the many members of our community who have worked for Qantas and helped build that airline and the reputation that it has. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a once-in-a-century pandemic, yet the Morrison government won't provide support for our aviation workers when they need it the most. The latest cruel act from Qantas is the result of the Morrison government's ongoing failure to plan for Australia's aviation industry. Aviation is an essential industry in Australia, and as we continue to recover from the crisis we rely on aviation workers to get us in the air and to get the economy back off the ground. But instead of developing a plan for aviation, the Morrison government has denied support for airports, denied JobKeeper to dnata workers, allowed Virgin to fall into administration and now stood by while Qantas sacks thousands of its loyal workers. That's why this month Labor has initiated a Senate inquiry into the impact of the pandemic and its effects on Australian aviation, how the government responded and, importantly, what the industry needs into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to the Prime Minister and the Morrison government is: why aren't you standing up for Qantas workers? Many of them live in your electorate, Prime Minister. Why aren't you meeting with them and standing up for those Qantas workers who have lost their jobs? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, I was delighted to join celebrations for the 10th anniversary of Randwick City Football Club. Randwick City FC was founded in 2010 by a group of like-minded individuals who love football and had the vision to create an inclusive family club. I pay particular tribute to the current president, Richard Baldwin, who's been there for all of the 10 years, was the foundation and did a lot of work to establish the club. The club is a volunteer-run and not-for-profit club, and it has grown into one of the most vibrant and ambitious soccer clubs in Sydney, catering for multiple teams and abilities. Randwick City FC now has teams playing in the Eastern Suburbs Football Association, including three women's teams and one team in the men's competition at the championship level, along with a Sunday all-age competition and an over 45s league. Randwick City is also home to the mighty Purple Hearts, a team for senior and junior players with disabilities. I'd like to give a shout-out to the Purple Hearts players and their coach, Ben Folino. It was great to catch up with Ben and the team at their 10th anniversary celebrations and one of their recent training sessions in Kensington. I got to see the new players trying out their gear and training equipment purchased with the help of a stronger communities grant from Kingsford Smith. There's a keen sense of anticipation for 2021, when we'll hopefully see more games and more wins for Randwick. Congratulations to all associated with Randwick City FC on your 10th anniversary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also proud to be part of Sydney's first circular economy festival, recently organised by Seaside Scavenge in Little Bay. Using a fun approach, Seaside Scavenge helps to educate communities and businesses about marine debris pollution and textile waste, turning trash into cash. Seaside Scavenge hosts waterway clean-up festivals such as the Looped Festival in Little Bay. The idea is that litter collected from local waterways becomes currency in a pop-up market to purchase preloved clothes and goods that have been donated to our local community. It's really all about cleaning up our oceans and our local environment to help create circular economies of waste. I'm pleased that a Kingsford Smith communities environment grant helped to make the Looped Festival event at Little Bay possible. Seaside Scavenge has a great track record of making real progress in our war against waste. Since 2015, Seaside Scavenge has hosted 53 events that have inspired over 6,000 participants in 37 communities across Australia and the globe to remove 10,850 kilograms of litter and 162,000 cigarette butts as well as redistribute about 8,000 kilograms of second-hand clothes. On the day we heard from some of the people who have established local businesses around recycling and repurposing waste materials into new products. One of those was young Harry. Harry and his dad established a company called Good Citizens Eyewear, whereby people can take plastic waste, particularly plastic bottles, and recycle them and turn them into sunglasses. The company is doing so well and Harry is doing so well that he recently addressed the United Nations. That is a great example of the circular economy at work, taking what would otherwise be discarded waste, particularly plastic, and repurposing it, recycling it and turning it into a sellable product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seaside Scavenge do a great job of highlighting business opportunities such as this, to educate our community about the impacts of food, plastic and textile waste and to provide practical solutions to this big problem. I also commend the focus on supporting our local cafes, restaurants and bars to audit their waste and provide reusable alternatives, BYO container incentives and much more. Well done to the team at Seaside Scavenge and everyone who attended the Looped Festival in Little Bay. I am sure this is going to be an annual event that will grow bigger and bigger and bigger, because there are many in the community that I represent who want to recycle more and who want to know about how they can play their part in creating a cleaner, safer environment for our kids. Well done to Seaside Scavenge.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I rise today to use this grievance debate to discuss some of the fantastic initiatives the Morrison government is spearheading to support our regional, remote and rural communities in WA who are doing it tough through drought. I contrast this with the callous disregard and lack of action by the Western Australia Labor government. Drought wreaks havoc on regional communities, often for prolonged periods of time, and brings with it uncertainty, despair, financial hardship and a blow to community spirit. Our <span style="font-style:italic;">Drought response, resilience and preparedness plan</span> sets the framework to help our farmers and rural communities prepare for drought and manage its effects into the future. Our plan is focused on three themes: immediate action for those in drought, support for the wider communities affected by drought, and long-term resilience and preparedness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a role to play in dealing with drought. This includes all levels of government, industry, individual farmers and businesses. To this end, the On-farm Emergency Water Infrastructure Rebate Scheme is an excellent program that provides rebates of up to 25 per cent of eligible infrastructure costs for on-farm water, capped at $25,000. This scheme helps farmers keep livestock watered and permanent plantings alive during drought. It means our farmers are more productive and better prepared for the inevitable drought in years to come. The rebate has justifiably been popular because the infrastructure it supports provides enduring and ongoing benefits. This includes new bores, better dams and pipes to move the water around farms to where stock need it. A total of 941 rebates have been approved in Western Australia, totalling $3.76 million. Unfortunately, there remains, to this day, 411 applications which have not yet been paid out. Despite the scheme being oversubscribed, the Western Australian government, who administer the scheme on behalf of the federal government, continue to approve and accept applications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has been inundated with calls from farmers who are already doing it tough and have invested significantly to make their properties more drought-resilient only to find there is no money left in the fund. I have campaigned strongly for a further allocation towards this excellent scheme. I was very pleased when the minister for water, Keith Pitt, allocated an extra $50 million to the scheme in early October. This will take the federal government contribution to $100 million in total. As mentioned, combating drought needs a multipronged approach by all levels of government as well as farmers and business. So we call on the state governments to match the federal government contribution, dollar for dollar, to support our WA farmers. To this day, the WA government has refused to get on board and provide this matching funding. In fact, they have done absolutely nothing to support our farmers suffering drought in any area. It's an absolute disgrace. To add insult to injury, I recently discovered that the WA Department of Water charged the federal government half a million dollars just to administer the scheme, which is a slap in the face to farmers doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extremely frustrating to see the federal government invest further funds into drought support schemes while the state government continue to show their complete indifference. We invested $140 million in combating salinity in the Wellington Dam, the second-largest surface-water catchment in Western Australia. This $400 million project has now been shelved because the state government hasn't been able to negotiate the appropriate commercial agreements. The Southern Forests Irrigation Scheme in Manjimup had $40 million in federal funding injected into it, but it has now become bogged down in the state bureaucracy. I will continue to work with the Southern Forests Irrigation Co-operative to ensure this vital project goes ahead, but it concerns me that our state governments don't seem to be as interested as I am.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My good friend David Dwyer has been preselected as the Liberal candidate for Roe. As a rural accountant of many years standing, he has a very good understanding of the issues facing our rural communities. He and I met recently with farmers in Lake Grace to discuss his plans for drought mitigation in that part of my electorate. I was pleased to hear he is working closely with shadow minister David Honey to establish water policies leading up to the state election which will support our drought affected farmers. I was able to discuss with David the policies that comprise our $8 billion worth of drought assistance measures aimed at supporting farmers, including the Drought Communities Program. This program supports communities in the most drought affected regions in Australia, 20 shires of which are located in my electorate of O'Connor. Communities of less than 1,000 people receive $500,000 and communities with larger populations receive $1 million to get local infrastructure projects and other drought relief activities off the ground. The Morrison government is here for our rural and regional communities that are doing it tough through drought and will support them for as long as it takes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minutes that I have remaining, I want to talk about another issue which is particularly important to the farmers in my electorate, and that is the live export trade. Just this week we heard that Qatar has withdrawn its subsidy on the import of chilled meat—chilled mutton, in particular. This will have a huge impact on Hillside Meat Processors in the town of Narrogin in my electorate. They supply around 12½ thousand sheep per week to the air freight trade. These are lightweight sheep. The alternative market for those sheep is the live export trade. Unfortunately, the Western Australian Labor Minister for Agriculture, Alannah MacTiernan, has been a vehement opponent and critic of the live export trade. Several years ago, when we had an unfortunate incident in the Middle East, in Qatar, the Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia was gleefully telling farmers the live export trade was finished and we needed to find plan B. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that Qatar are no longer subsidising chilled meat imports means their reliance on live export will only increase. So while Western Australia farmers have lost that chilled meat trade, the live export trade is only going to increase in importance and value. I say to the Western Australia Minister for Agriculture, Ms MacTiernan: what is your plan C? Because plan B is not working out all that well at this stage. I want to reiterate my support for the live export trade. It is a critical part of the meat trade out of Western Australia and it deserves the support of governments at all levels. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to draw attention to the fact that the Saudi Arabian market is the largest live export market in the world. They import up to eight million animals a year from mostly Black Sea and North African countries which do not have anything like the animal welfare protocols that the countries we export our sheep to have. The Saudi Arabian market is ready to be opened. The Australian government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi government to allow that trade to recommence. At the moment, we are just working through some of those protocols. Unfortunately, our own Department of Agriculture at the federal level has imposed conditions that, as a farmer and as someone who has supplied sheep over many years to the live export trade, are effectively impossible and impractical to implement at farm level. I will be continuing to work with our federal Minister for Agriculture, Minister Littleproud, to try and iron out some of those bumps so that Western Australian farmers can see that enormous live export market in Saudi Arabia reopened. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, our friends in the Middle East have supported us strongly in the barley market. As members of the House will be aware, the Chinese government has imposed an 80 per cent tariff on barley out of Australia, meaning that particular market for Western Australian farmers, which took 80 per cent of our barley, is now gone. The Saudi Arabians have stepped up. Last week there was a 700,000 tonne tender for Western Australian barley at strong prices, which will absorb a lot of this year's crop. In our overall trade relationship, our Middle Eastern partners have certainly stepped up to take more of our live sheep product and more of our barley. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  It is not every day that a group of teenagers does you the honour of naming a young kid only a couple of days old after you, but that's what the boys at RuffTrack Farm did for me when showing me around their property with their goats, sheep, horse, ducks and assorted other animals and, of course, dogs. Dogs are possibly the key ingredient of the youth charity that takes the most vulnerable young people from the Hawkesbury between the ages of 13 and 17 and gives them the tools, skills and confidence to set their own direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have probably seen video of dogs jumping high up the K9 Super Wall into the arms of their young owners. That's the result of a deep bond that's developed between dog and teenager. There are 24 dogs, and the bond starts with the cleaning out of the dog poo every morning from the enclosures and learning how to care for and groom the dogs, and then training them in dog sports and sheep herding. They raise the money to cover the food, the upkeep and the vet bills by visiting schools and agricultural shows with their animal program and performing dog shows, which due to COVID have, of course, all been cancelled. The adults who work with them, like Dave Graham and Georgia Cherrie, are volunteers. They're connected with the Hawkesbury PCYC, the Hawkesbury Jets basketball club and Hawkesbury's Helping Hands—all playing a part in shaping a different future for these kids, who have had, without exception, a really tough start. They may have been in constant contact with police. It may be drug issues, family violence or school suspensions. RuffTRACK takes up to five people from each of the Hawkesbury high schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On my visit, the boys invited me to hear their morning discussion about how their weekend had gone. I was really privileged to be asked to sit in the circle. The teenagers were articulate, able to discuss their feelings and identify the things that were making them feel good or not so good. Jesse, Jonno and Bryson showed me round the farm, talking about how being one of the RuffTRACK boys had changed their lives. They had Penny the horse come running over towards us. They were gentle with the tiny kids and explained in awe to me how fast the ducklings were growing. I get that these won't be perfect kids. Who has perfect kids? They'll make mistakes. They'll make bad choices. But these are really impressive young men, and I can't help but think that Dave and the environment he has created and the bonds that they create will give them the best shot at a better life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked them if they were happy for me to speak about RuffTRACK in parliament, and you bet they were. So I'm going to finish with a sample of their words of wisdom. Fifteen-year-old Blain says: 'RuffTRACK has helped me out with a lot of life situations like how to get out of toxic relationships.' Jon says he's learnt to open up about stuff that he wouldn't have been able to otherwise. Rory and Bryson add: 'Dave and the support adults have been there for me.' For Whyatt, Ashton, Kie and Ajay, it's the brotherhood bonds with the lads and the connections with people. And the last word goes to 14-year-old Joseph: 'My favourite thing about RuffTRACK is everyone here and my dog.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The founder of Cancer Wellness Support, Robyn Yates, lost her own battle with motor neurone disease on 27 November. I first met Robyn about a decade ago, when her vision to support people experiencing cancer was already well underway. In 2005 she leased a space in Katoomba and opened the first op shop to fund her work. Now there's a second op shop, in Penrith, and the community based model provides more than 5,000 subsidised therapies a year. This includes counselling, lymphoedema management, massage, yoga and art therapy. That's the vision—providing affordable subsidised therapies to people living with cancer, their carers and families, throughout the Blue Mountains and Penrith Valley regions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To mark the organisation's 15th birthday, the Leura centre was named the Robyn Yates Centre earlier this year, and I've been pleased to assist with improvements to that centre. In spite of her own ill health, Robyn stayed active and involved in the organisation and in other community groups. I thank the chair of Cancer Wellness Support, Bob Reid, for highlighting Robyn's own words on being awarded an OAM. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The thing that really floats my boat is when I see a person transformed from someone who is anxious and vulnerable when they come in the door. And then, when they start accessing our services or going to groups, they regain control and confidence and can actually see a future for themselves. Blue Mountains Cancer Help tries to offer a sense of hope. It's empowering to discover there are many things you can do to improve your healing capacity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is becoming clearer that the Morrison government's promise of $200 million to duplicate Richmond Bridge is not going to cut it. The RMS has refused to brief me on the latest options it has prepared, and the Deputy Prime Minister doesn't seem to care that the federal representative in the electorate where millions are going to be spent in years to come is completely excluded from the process. The issue wasn't even on the national agenda until I began highlighting the traffic problems back in 2010. It was the then infrastructure minister, now Leader of the Opposition, Anthony Albanese, who provided the first funding to look at the options for the poor drivers who are just stuck in traffic trying to get across the river. A decade on, barely a cent extra has been spent from the original $20 million we committed. The latest information stakeholders have shows that the only bridge you can get for the current $200 million is one that has minimal improvement in flood resilience. That is not what people want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time the federal government recognised that a budget bridge isn't what this community wants or, more importantly, needs. We need a proper crossing, one that require more funding, so that the roads and approaches can be flood resilient. We face a high chance of flood and fire and, in the interest of protecting lives, the Hawkesbury deserves more than a bargain basement bridge!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australiana Pioneer Village has celebrated its 50th birthday, a testament to the volunteers, known as Friends of Pioneer Village—otherwise known as the Village People. The village was looking its finest for the celebrations, and Costa Georgiadis was there to give crowds tips and techniques on their gardening and their chooks. The land on which the village is situated was farmland, recognised as essential to the survival of colonial New South Wales, and it was one of the earliest grants made in Australia, registered in 1797. Bill McLaughlin, an industrial chemist, bought the property and began to plan a pioneer village. Owners of many historic buildings in the seventies in the district jumped at the chance to have their building preserved in the one place, and 12 of buildings were used to establish the village. It opened in November 1970, and I was one of many school groups who visited it through the seventies as one of our, I think, year 3 school excursions. But, in time, the village fell into disuse, and it reopened after a long community effort on 26 January 2011. So it celebrates a 10th anniversary in a couple of months. I want to thank all of the volunteers who made the 50th possible—the committee, the people on the gate and in the cafe, the train drivers, the tractor drivers, the mowers and the cleaners, Bowen and Clare for the music. You helped create an absolutely lovely celebration.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to the shopkeepers, cafes and restaurants of Leura who are signing up for the Zero Waste Leura target. This is a target on food waste—to have zero food waste. The Blue Mountains council is on board, and I'm thrilled to see that the initiative started by James Howarth, of the Leura Garage, a year ago is going further. I spoke about this initiative a year ago. James has this incredible composter that sits within his restaurant. It takes the food waste and it turns it into something that you can actually dig your hands into and smell, because it doesn't smell revolting. Over this year, they've worked out how to take that waste, convert into compost and use it on the community gardens in Blackheath—thanks to the Big Fix. That is working so well that the rest of Leura is looking at this and saying, 'Hey, we want to do this as well.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leura Village Association is on board, supported by the New South Wales EPA and Sustainable Futures. This team of people is, over the next 12 months, going to be working through the process to see how this can happen for an entire village. The vision at the end of it is to have the waste reused back into the gardens that run through Leura Village. Leura is famous for its gardens festival. This is one of the fantastic ideas that's coming from the community—ground up, you could say—and being supported by government agencies who know that we need to care about the environment and that local community groups can make a significant difference. I was also pleased to see proprietors from The Carrington in Katoomba at the launch in Leura. Wouldn't it be great to see this sort of thing stretch beyond Leura to all of the villages of the mountains?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:33</span>):  In this parliament, we do incredible work which largely flies under the radar. I'm not talking about the government here. The government does incredible work, obviously—and governments of all stripes rarely stay quiet about their achievements. Governments are no shrinking violets. I'm talking here about parliament, specifically parliamentary committees sitting outside of the executive, and the efforts of dozens of MPs of all stripes who come together to work in a bipartisan way to find facts, uncover evidence, verify it and make recommendations to inform policy for the betterment of all Australians. Committee inquiries are parliament at its best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past 10 years, I've been involved in dozens of committees and scores of reports. I've had the honour to chair three of them and that led to 10 inquiries. All of these groups have been incredibly collegiate, dedicated and intelligent. We've put out detailed recommendations based on the advice of experts, designed to create the best possible policies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't deal with minor subjects, either. One inquiry ongoing at the moment is into the way we pay for and access medicines—hardly a minor topic in 2020. I've led inquiries into the housing market at a time when housing prices were booming beyond all recognition and many young people were legitimately concerned that they would never get into the housing market. Over the last three years the committee I currently chair has looked into ways to regulate and facilitate the expected growth in electric cars; a vision for the future settlement of Australia; and next week I'll be tabling a report into how we can fund the infrastructure to build our way out of the current economic doldrums. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't insignificant stuff. That brings me to a point of grievance. We spend months and sometimes years on these inquiries. Teams from the Department of Parliamentary Services spend hours organising evidence sessions, polling submissions and preparing for interviews; then they put weeks into synthesising all these plus the wishes of our disparate groups into reports that can run up to 500 pages in length. Huge amounts of effort, time and money go into these inquiries, and they generate valuable and important recommendations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet so many of these inquiries go nowhere. Back in 2016 I chaired the economics committee, and we were tasked with looking into the housing affordability crisis which was gripping our suburbs. This was a critical issue, a crisis that kept young people out of homes, put mortgage stress on thousands of young families and, worse, threatened to bring an economic crisis that would rip the confidence out from under overexposed banks. It was clear that the business-as-usual routine of boom and bust was dangerous and growing more dangerous as the boom kept booming. It was essential that we find a way to reduce the amplitude of these waves to ensure that owning a home didn't end up as just a treat for the wealthy. Bennelong had seen over a 75 per cent increase in housing prices in the previous three years. The infallible profits were drawing developers to build high-rise buildings, which were popping up one after another through Epping and Macquarie Park. But it was obvious that this was unsustainable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We needed to act. Thankfully, the experts that came to the table were not only highly knowledgeable; they were also very open-minded to reform. Suggestions came through thick and fast for innovations like levers to control the deductibility for investors, putting housing into super, which was deemed safer than putting super into housing, and funnelling investors into trusts which could invest in affordable housing for essential workers—all really good and innovative ideas. We had an interim report which made really strong recommendations, but before we could table the final version there was a reshuffle of chairs and I moved elsewhere. From here, the report was quietly dropped and pushed aside for many months. Only after pressure in the media was the inquiry report finally released, and then it appeared pillaged and bare. All recommendations had been removed, leaving the impression that the housing market was completely stable, affordable and perfect. Needless to say, this lack of recommendations was accepted unequivocally. In the months before the COVID recession, 127 apartments next to my house in Epping were forced to sell in line at a 50 per cent discount because of oversaturation, sending developers to the brink. But that's a story for another day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From here, I moved to be Chairman of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities. Here we conducted two related inquiries: <span style="font-style:italic;">Harnessing value, delivering infrastructure</span> in 2017, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Building up &amp; moving out</span> in 2018. The first looked at the infrastructure needed to bring us up to the 21st century, while the second looked at an even broader view of the settlement planning of our country. Together they created a compelling vision for our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has never had a plan of settlement. Occasionally cities put forward sweeping plans, but these are always fragmented and usually do not survive a change of government. There is nothing long-term in Australia's planning, and there never has been. Over a century ago, this manifested itself in the ridiculous chaos of Australia's rail gauges, which changed three times on the journey along the east coast of Australia. This obvious problem should have wised up the new Federation to creating plan, and yet for 120 years we have gone wanting. State governments are building fast-train routes out to their regions—something that is certainly needed. Meanwhile, the federal government is building freight lines across the eastern states and a new airport in Western Sydney. Between all of this, patchwork fixes are being done to modernise ageing infrastructure, like the Pacific Highway, but none of this is being done in conjunction with anything else. The fast regional rail lines between Sydney and Melbourne will one day meet up, but, when they do, will the systems be compatible? Will the gauges be compatible? Will we have an impact on the viability of the world's busiest air corridor over land and, in turn, on the viability of Badgerys Creek airport? What's the sense in a freight line that only has a freight airport at one distant end?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our inquiry set out a vision for Australia: a string of new smart cities connected and nurtured by fast links to our capitals through high-speed rail funded by value capture on the uplift in land prices created by the new infrastructure. This would create jobs, growth and affordable housing for decades to come, unburdening our bulging cities by creating the impetus for our regions to boom. It's not just a plan; it's a vision for the future of Australia. In response, the government have noted our recommendations. In their defence, two new groups have been created in the department of infrastructure: the National Faster Rail Agency and the Infrastructure and Project Financing Agency, which recently moved to the Treasury. These are a good start, but the action taken to address even part of this vision is minimal and a plan of settlement still remains absent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next week, I'll be tabling another report from this inquiry which directly relates to these two previous ones. While they set out the 'what', the next one sets out the 'how'. It paints a compelling picture of how to fund this vision. It spells out what needs to happen next to create a fair value-capture funding method to ensure that the infrastructure is built while getting a fair deal for the taxpayer, whom we serve. It takes on additional importance in the current context of our economy. It presents a plan to fund our economic recovery and stimulate our economy without burdening future generations. We have inadvertently created a post-COVID roadmap for this country. There will be more details to discuss shortly, but I would say that, again, many hours and much expertise have gone into this report and it would be shameful if the recommendations were not taken with the seriousness they deserve.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If more demonstration of current indifference to committee work were needed, I'd like to end this strange tale with Jane Prentice's smart cities inquiry, which wrapped up in 2016, just before I took over the committee. It contained detailed and evidence based recommendations on how to ready our cities for future decades. Well, we are now in the next decade and Jane has not been an MP for over 18 months, but still the government sit on their hands and there has been no response. Once again, a parliamentary committee has done wonderful work for the people of Australia and it has gone nowhere. We must and we should do better.</span>
