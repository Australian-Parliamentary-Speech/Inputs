         That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Thursday 16 September 1993 of Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal, poet, writer, educator and Aboriginal activist, and places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family and community in their bereavement.

        Oodgeroo was born Kathleen Jean Mary Ruska on North Stradbroke Island in 1920. Her parents belonged to the Noonuccal tribe. According to her biographer, she spent a happy childhood with her family on the island but at the age of 13, and at the completion of her primary schooling, she was sent to the mainland as a live-in domestic worker for 2s 6d a week.

         It was as Kath Walker that she first came to the attention of many Australians. She changed her name by deed poll in 1988—the same year in which she returned her MBE in protest at the bicentennial celebrations, which she felt celebrated a history of systematic discrimination by white people against Aboriginal Australians. `Two hundred years of humiliation and brutality' was the way she expressed it. She had put essentially the same message in a different way in the powerful poem,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          We Are Going

         During the 1960s she served both as secretary to the Queensland Aboriginal Advancement League and as secretary to the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. She was a key figure in the 1967 referendum campaign. She was one of the first writers to draw our attention to the importance of land rights. She wrote in 1968:

         In 1985 she was named Aborigine of the Year, indicating, as if it were needed, the respect and esteem in which she was held by her own people. Throughout her life she assumed the role of educator, believing that a better understanding of her people would help bring about a more equitable Australia and a more just and lasting reconciliation between Aboriginal and other Australians.

Australia lost one of its great and passionate voices with the death of Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal, custodian of the land of Minjerriba, or Kath Walker, as she was known for many years. When people speak of Oodgeroo, they speak of her poetry, and the anger and despair that she brought to her stories of the many tragedies of her people. They also speak of the beauty in her poetry as she gave us the pleasure of her `dreaming'.

         Yet Oodgeroo was much more than just a great poet. She was an artist and a teacher who brought Aboriginal culture to thousands of school children who visited her over many decades on Stradbroke Island. Oodgeroo believed, quite rightly, that the education of our children is crucial to building a better understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.

         Much of the credit for the success of the 1967 referendum on Aboriginal voting rights has rightly gone to Oodgeroo. The story goes that in the years leading up to 1967 and to the referendum, in a meeting with Prime Minister Menzies, Kath Walker, as she was then known, asked for and was offered a glass of sherry by Prime Minister Menzies. On receiving the glass, Kath Walker told the Prime Minister, `Mr Prime Minister, it is only fair that I warn you that under the laws of Queensland you would be in the position of either getting two weeks in gaol or a fine of #50 for giving me this'.

Since her passing I have read with interest the various articles in the media about her in which she has been described as a `national treasure', a `battler' and a `trailblazer'. I also read of the memorial service and burial of Oodgeroo on Stradbroke Island whilst humpback whales swam slowly out to sea through Moreton Bay. I am sure it must have been a very moving service for all involved, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who was present that day.

         As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have said, her political involvement goes back many decades and includes the watershed 1967 referendum regarding Australians of Aboriginal heritage. This referendum was passed by a record majority of some 93 per cent—a great victory for Oodgeroo's cause for full-scale recognition of all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, and also bringing them for the first time into the census count on a full and proper basis.

         Oodgeroo was a staunch ally of the reconciliation process. She was driven by sheer dedication to the process, involving, as it does, commitment to social justice, a program to educate the wider community about indigenous issues and consultation on a formal document of reconciliation, by whatever name, as one of the possible outcomes of the process.

         The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is right to highlight that, while the process officially began in 1990 with the unanimous support of the parliament, Oodgeroo recognised the process much earlier as the only true path towards a united Australia. At her funeral last week her surviving son, Denis, said that if reconciliation was achieved between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians his mother would truly rest in peace. He said that the main message was reconciliation, healing and peace and the only way we are going to get that is through mutual respect for his culture and all other cultures.

        In 1988, in protest against the bicentennial celebrations, she changed her name from Kath Walker and renounced what some regarded as her highest honour: the MBE that she was awarded in the 1970 Queen's Birthday honours. It was not a popular decision at the time in some quarters when patriotism was at fever pitch. However, popularity was not Oodgeroo's trophy; it was the knowledge that she had remained true to herself and to Aboriginal people. Despite all that she endured, Oodgeroo did feel that Australia had a future worth nurturing.

         I do not propose to dwell on the many accolades which were heaped on her during her literary and political life except to say that, had she received none of them, she would still have been seen as a hero to many Australians and particularly to Aboriginal people. She sought to help others free themselves from the shackles of ignorance that have plagued relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. She knew that with knowledge came understanding. A gentle and peaceful person, she sought to teach rather than confront.

Many words have been used to describe her—tenacious, passionate, loyal, talented, controversial and stubborn.

         Her passion for her people ranged from nurturing her extended family, to promoting the culture of her people through her own literary works and art, and educating both black and white young people about Aboriginal history and culture. Her passion, however, led her to become a committed activist on behalf of her people, and many a politician from all sides of politics felt the wrath of Oodgeroo.

         The term `trailblazer' is indeed an apt description of her. As a young black woman reared on Stradbroke Island and one of six children, where her formal education had ended by the age of 13, it is remarkable that this woman became the first Aboriginal author to be published; to produce works of prose and poetry; to be honoured by several universities, including being made a Doctor of Literature of Macquarie University—this being one of four honorary doctorates; to travel internationally as an official envoy to numerous conferences; to lecture overseas and win a Fulbright scholarship; to be a poet in residence at Bloomsburg State College, Pennsylvania; and to receive an international acting award for her part in

She was, first and foremost, both ambassador and activist for her people. Changing her name from Kath Walker to her Aboriginal name Oodgeroo Noonuccal was a public recognition of her roots. Just as she constantly sought a greater understanding of her own history and culture, she encouraged others to do likewise and have pride in their history. Above all, she loved teaching Aboriginal lore to young children, both black and white, and channelled her energies and hope into achieving a greater level of understanding through them.

Oodgeroo, of the tribe Noonuccal, custodian of the land Minjerriba—otherwise known for much of her life as Kath Walker—as we have heard was born on Stradbroke Island. She was a member of a large family and led a very rich and varied life. Having left school at a very early age, she went into domestic service, for 2s 6d a week. Subsequently, she served in the army. Later in life, at the age of 37, she returned to education. That became a passion in her life, as time went by. Her first book,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          We Are Going

         She was active in a number of other ways. In 1976 she was a delegate and senior adviser at the First World Black Festival of Arts in Nigeria. In 1978 she won a Fulbright scholarship and she was appointed a member of the Aboriginal Arts Board of Australia in 1983. I am told that she was even once a member of the state women's cricket team. Even in her 70s, in 1992, she was out and about getting doctorates from Monash University and the Queensland University of Technology. Her activities were not confined to this country. Internationally, her poems were included in an anthology published in the Soviet Union. She was listed in the Black Hall of Fame in Washington and she spent a term as poet in residence at Bloomsburg State College in Pennsylvania. She was Australia's delegate to the World Council of Churches consultation on racism and she was a member of an Australian delegation which toured China in 1985.

         This basically meant that, if you were Aboriginal and lived in an institution, on a reserve or in many working areas, someone else had control of your wages, your pension, your property—in other words, your life.

          She played a key role in persuading the Commonwealth government to hold that referendum which extended the Commonwealth's power to have a greater capacity to formulate programs specifically designed to address disadvantage for Aboriginal people—in other words, positive discrimination.

         Oodgeroo—or Kath Walker, as many people remember her—was a great Australian. But, I guess like all great Australians, she had her detractors as well as those who revered her. The tall poppy syndrome, of course, is one of the more immature aspects of our Australian culture—an unwillingness to be proud of our great achievers. But Oodgeroo has given us a memory, a memory of someone who is willing to fight for her beliefs, to accept the knocks with the plaudits, to do everything in her power to make the world a better place to live in for everyone.

         We first came into close contact over a decade ago, before I became a member of this House. I was approached by Kath to help set up the North Stradbroke Island housing cooperative. I did so in my capacity as a solicitor at the time. Oodgeroo was responsible for a number of community enterprises on Stradbroke Island. Besides the very successful housing co-op, there was a health centre, a preschool group and an extension of the Redlands Community College. But her centre at Moongalba was her greatest love. Kath always wanted to create a unique centre for educating children, university students and teachers of all races in the ways of the Aboriginal culture.

Thanks to people such as Oodgeroo, Australia has moved ahead somewhat since those days.

Joan Hendriks, the teacher coordinator of the School of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education at Kangaroo Point TAFE college in Brisbane remembers her most by three words that she used to say all the time: `Don't hate—educate'. Estelle Bertossi and Rose Borey, women of Aboriginal descent who live on Stradbroke Island, have been associated with Kath since 1945 when, as teenagers, they worked in Brisbane, were taken under her wing and lived with her. They remember her tireless dedication, the endless hours of work and the civil rights speeches when civil rights for Aborigines were non-existent in most communities. They remember the sorrow, the laughter, the pride and the inexhaustible energy of this lone Aboriginal woman as she fought against the injustices perpetrated under the Aborigines Protection Act where children were removed from their families and Aborigines banished to other missions at the drop of a hat. They also remember Kath as a sportswoman in her own right and the many hours she spent teaching children to swim at the local swimming pool. They remember the laughter and the stories.

Firstly, she fought to get a dominant white culture to realise the extent and the depth of Aboriginal culture and the contribution that it could make to the development of our society if only the Aboriginal people were given a go.

         I pay my sincere condolences to Kath's son, Denis. I have no doubt at all that the inspiration of his mother will enable him to lead and play a similar and important role on behalf of the indigenous people of this land. I believe, when we finally determine how we will resolve the processes of reconciliation and Mabo, the spirit of Kath Walker will be sitting in judgment. That is when she will decide whether we have passed a condolence motion that is really responding to a great life, a great spokeswoman for the Aboriginal people and a great spokeswoman for the whole of Australia.

         Kath was born in a period when it was good for people to be shy about their Aboriginal descent because if they were not they could be packed off to reservations, as they were then called. In the second period, it was smart to be an `Uncle Tom' so that one could be looked after and trotted out at all important ceremonies. As Kath grew up, she did not fit into that category. Then we entered a period when it was the thing to be filled with shrieking, hate-filled aggression. Kath did not fit into that category.

         A previous speaker, Kath's member of parliament, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca)—who I suppose, like me, knew her—said that she was a quiet person. When it became very fashionable to get a lot of money and very nice jobs, Kath did not come forward during that period either. It seems that whatever it was popular to be, Kath most certainly was not—whether she was out of step or had a will to fight, I do not know.

         Finally, and I think it is one of the sad comments that I have to make today, even though Kath hated what was happening and had a very clear vision of what might be—which she never lost sight of—she did not let her beliefs overflow into vindictive hatreds on a racial or personal basis. Her member of parliament said that previously, and I endorse his sentiments very strongly.

         Here was a person who could come to you without hate filling her soul. I found her a very popular person. Kath mixed with many people on Stradbroke Island. Even though there were some very angry fights, Kath took the position that sandmining on the island should stop. This decision was very unpopular since about 90 per cent of her people on the island had jobs associated with the sandmining interests. But she believed in and was going to press ahead with that view regardless of what anyone else said. People when they met her could not help liking Kath. Without hate in her soul, she stated her position. However outrageous it might have been at times, people could not help liking her for having that trait.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          She put a very legitimate request to me for some land which was being occupied by squatters. It was not an outrageous ambit claim or demand; it was a legitimate request. A sad part of Aboriginal affairs in Australia is that, to my knowledge, that request still has not been agreed to. Instructions were written out—I left the ministry soon afterwards—but have never been carried out despite all of the changes that have occurred.

I think that, amongst many other things, there is another message to be carried there today.

         These bills were provided to the opposition on Friday as a courtesy so that they could, hopefully, receive speedy passage through this House and, hopefully, through the Senate as well. Yet when the honourable member for Mayo was asked about this matter on Sunday, he said that, whilst he had not received any advice about the constitutional validity of these eight bills, he expected to receive some and he expected to be told that some of these bills would be unconstitutional. When he was asked which of these two bills might be unconstitutional, instead of saying, `I don't know', which was obviously the right answer, he went on to say:

         I say to the honourable member for Mayo, because a few QCs say that there may be some constitutional questions about these things, that the only way in which the matter can be clarified is by the High Court. The only way this matter can get to the High Court is if the parliament passes a bill which includes the issue of rates increases as well as other subjects of taxation. It is for this reason that we are simply offering an opportunity for those who believe there is an issue—and the government does not believe there is an issue—to have this bill put before the High Court and determined by it in a way which was not—

         We should also remember the bids of Melbourne and Brisbane, both of which were necessary to make this bid a success. They were both good bids. They were rejected by the IOC in their time, but they were the building blocks upon which the Sydney bid was built. Without them, with a majority of simply one vote, I am quite certain it would not have been possible for Sydney to win. But above all, the victory was a victory for the people of Australia and for Australians in their love of sport.

         I think it is important to use the Olympics as a spur to a greater general effort for the country at large. This decision was applauded widely overseas because it went to a free and fair society. I think the nation we have become, the values we hold, were very much in the upper mind of the International Olympic Committee. To defeat a bid as strong as that of China, which has such a large proportion of the world's population, and to defeat it when I am quite sure the Chinese were quite confident of its success, was not only a significant thing to have been done, but it was done largely around not just the values of sport but the freedom and sense of democracy which Australians have and which have been recognised not only around the world but most particularly by the International Olympic Committee.

For all our problems, when one returns to Australia, one returns to a good, peaceful and efficient society. Everyone who steps off a plane after being through the Northern Hemisphere, or most anywhere else in the world, understands that to be completely true.

At the beginning of the Prime Minister's answer, because of the subject matter of the question, you called on the opposition, in the name of bipartisanship, not to interject. The Prime Minister is now clearly going beyond answering a question on the Olympic games. He is raving on about his own government. Mr Speaker, you should tell the Prime Minister, having completed his answer, to sit down and not prevail on our bipartisan attitude to something that all Australians love and revere.

This budget is making sure that we continue with that record: fast growth with low inflation and low interest rates—the kind of outlook that will provide the kind of certainty and security, not only for our own companies but also for the increasing number of overseas companies who want to do business in this country.

This market alone is expected to be worth something like $A5 billion, and is only one of a range of markets available to Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. As that region continues to grow very rapidly, and given the fine state of legal expertise in our legal institutions in Australia, we are well placed to secure an improving and increasing level of legal exports.

         The legal profession has to address some matters in order to secure Australia's opportunities in the export of legal services. The first and most pressing of those is the question of the nature of the legal profession: namely, are we to have a truly national legal profession rather than a combination—as we have at the moment—of state based professions and, in some instances, two professions in each state and territory?

The Law Council of Australia, amongst other bodies, has been very much involved.

         The government has taken the lead through the formation of two very important committees designed to work with the private profession to expand our export opportunities. The first of these is the International Legal Services Advisory Committee, ILSAC, under the very able leadership of Sir Laurence Street. This committee has operated for the past three years and has been well regarded for its success in establishing Australian legal contacts throughout our region. The second, the Australian Indo-China legal cooperation program, is a direct initiative of the government. This program was funded in the recent budget to the tune of $300,000 and is aimed at the countries of Indo-China with which Australia does have a close relationship, namely, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

I am confident that at the 28th legal convention in Hobart this week the profession will come to grips with the issue of getting a truly national profession operating, and that, from that confident base, Australia will be able to achieve the export earnings that are available to this country in legal services.

         Earlier the Prime Minister spoke about values.

Certainly that is precisely what is happening. That is guiding many of those companies that are now doing so well, either competing in our own domestic markets or, increasingly, not only competing with, but also beating, the best in the world.

He has announced on behalf of the Liberal Party that it intends to oppose the outlays measures in the budget which are associated with savings on HECS. This is contrary to suggestions by the Leader of the Opposition, during his response to the budget, that only those elements of the budget which he identified would be attacked. If this also happens to be part of the process, that will mean—given the list of complaints—another $12 million to $100 million that he wants to deal with in the area of outlays. I guess that one of these days we will hear something definitive from the Leader of the Opposition on what stand he does take on cutting outlays.

         As we have been challenged and criticised, let me go into the reasons why the government is pursuing this course. Quite simply, the government by the decisions we have taken will provide more opportunities for young people to get into university down the line. This year the government is putting $4.6 billion into higher education. That is about twice the OECD average in terms of the contribution to higher education in a national budget. Our contribution is about 4 1/2 per cent, which contrasts interestingly with Japan's 1.1 per cent of its budget provisions.

         We have some 580,000 students in universities. Since 1988, we have increased places by 25 per cent—some 95,000 places. That is an extraordinary achievement by any measure. We are dealing with autonomous bodies when we deal with universities, and there is a process of negotiation on how the resources are placed. Recently, those resources have gone overwhelmingly into creating opportunities for people who already hold degrees or who are seeking to extend their postgraduate studies. So 90 per cent of government funded expansion since 1988 has been taken up by students who have already been or are in the system. Opportunities for those new to higher education, particularly school leavers, have fallen over this time by about 8.1 per cent. We now have more than double the number of people than before who are leaving school and going into university, but that is less than we anticipated, even though the numbers in university are much ahead of what we anticipated. It is not commonly understood, although it ought to be, that people who fail to achieve their study at university in the normally laid down time inhibit other people from getting a university place.

         It is a zero sum game as far as people who are qualified to enter universities are concerned. A student who fails to complete his or her course and who is permitted by the university to stay at the university is a person who occupies a place which might otherwise have been provided for a school leaver. The government is undertaking a number of measures to alter the possibility for school leavers. One of the ways in which we will do that is that in our profiling processes with the universities we will assert a need on their part to provide greater opportunity for young school leavers coming into the system.

         —As I understand it, they were comparing academic records in which the Treasurer comes off more than favourably. Nevertheless, I agree that this is not the appropriate place for that discussion to take place. The second way in which we are attempting to persuade universities to open up additional places for school leavers is by providing them with greater flexibility in their tuition charging arrangements for post-graduate students, particularly those entering into course work. A third way in which we are doing it—and I would have thought this would have been imminently approved by the Liberal Party—is by building a small market element into it by making the cost of staying on beyond the time that one would normally expect a person to complete a course the subject of a minor increase in charges. I would have thought that that would have been more than adequately supported by a party which is still committed to introducing a voucher system with up-front fees charged to everybody across the board.

         The honourable member for Sturt needs to recognise the platform that he was elected on when he stands up here and talks about equity. He is still committed to a proposition that all students should pay up-front fees for their courses as well as their HECS. That ought not be forgotten. When we introduce a small element of market pressure to encourage students to complete their degrees in the minimal possible time, it raises yet another undisciplined shriek from the opposition that we have to cut outlays. But when we put up a proposition for a cut in outlays, the Leader of the Opposition, or some of his spokesmen, runs a hundred miles back from it.

I do not know why the Leader of the Opposition even bothers to be a leader of the opposition. Regional headquarters are often the hub of a company's operations in a region.

         The direct benefits to Australia of attracting regional headquarters are substantial. They create employment and business for local suppliers and generate investment in research and development facilities and export revenues. However, it is the indirect benefits to Australia that are potentially the most pervasive. These benefits generally result from interaction of Australian industry with the key multinational corporations operating in the region, and include technology transfer, importation of world best practice and competitive cultures, the generation of downstream investment and the strategic benefit of lifting the international profile of Australian industry. Further, there is the possibility of strategic alliances and access to high growth markets.

         Australia's comparative advantage in the market for regional headquarters stems from low establishment and operation costs. I refer to salaries, office costs, services, a competitive telecommunications sector, a comprehensive range of business services, political stability and an excellent lifestyle. To drive these points home, I have this morning launched the government's new regional headquarters campaign. The purpose of the campaign is to increase the profile of Australia as a regional headquarters location. In the first instance, the campaign will be targeted towards multinational corporations based in North America. European companies will be targeted in the second phase of the campaign. The centrepiece of the campaign is a brochure entitled,

          Australia: your business location in Asia

Of course, as chairman of the caucus committee on primary industries and energy, he has visited, with me, a number of these drought-affected areas. The fact of the matter is that the government has confronted this issue on two broad fronts. One is getting the policy right to ensure that we are making the farm sector, with assistance from effective government support programs, more self-reliant, more anticipatory of the problems facing it and that we are equipping it with the skills to respond. The other is to ensure that, in the process of doing this, there is an adequacy of funding and programs to assist farmers because we do not expect them to do it on their own.

         So far as the drought is concerned, it should be recalled that since the declaration of the severity of the drought in Queensland and New South Wales the Commonwealth has expended $16 million in relation to Queensland alone. The other day I made an announcement of an additional $3.1 million because the funding in that regard had run out. Of course, New South Wales has $8 million.

         But the fact of the matter is that there is, as with all programs, including this, no bottomless pit. Against that background, the government's attention has also been drawn to improving the administrative efficiency under which these schemes are developed and implemented. We are now about ensuring that the funds which the Commonwealth has made available get to those who need them.

         It was against that background that in Alice Springs in July of this year, in consultation with the states, we were able to claw back from state reserves $123 million to fund improved delivery to the rural sector under the rural adjustment scheme. This was supplemented by $70 million in the budget to ensure that the funding under the RAS will more than double for the next four years, which was not the case before the budget. So we have concentrated not only on policy and  adequacy of funding but also on the efficiency with which it is administered and delivered.

         Against the background of being able to claw back that money by agreement, we are now reviewing the guidelines under which the administration and standards for application apply.

         I might point out that, in relation to the funds complaints under the rural adjustment scheme, since the 1988 RAS came into existence the Commonwealth has funded $495 million, with only $16 million coming to it from the states. I believe this is a national problem which requires a contribution from all levels of government. In that regard, there is not only a commitment from our side that we will make sure that there are adequate funds available, but also we will ensure that the states play their role to maximise the assistance that is available.

Almost 1,000 participants from 100 countries travelled to Canberra for the conference, which has been described as an outstanding success by all those who took part.

         The inaugural session of the conference took place on 13 September, the day Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation signed their historic agreement in Washington. On the following day, in a reflection of the spirit of cooperation engendered by the conference, a resolution was adopted expressing wholehearted support for the accords which had been signed and urging continued efforts for a full, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.

Decisions were also taken in regard to a delegation of parliamentarians to visit the former Yugoslavia, IPU observation of El Salvador elections, an IPU mission to Cyprus and support to democracy in Haiti.

         The conference was preceded on Sunday 12 September by the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians. The meeting was chaired by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who might wish to make a statement separate to this in relation to its agenda and outcomes. Similarly, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), the leader of the Australian delegation to the conference, may report separately on the delegation's perspective on the conference proceedings. I might just add at this point that it was through the efforts of the honourable member for Watson when he was Speaker that the conference was secured for Australia. In addition to the formal work of the conference, many valuable and lasting bonds were formed through the social functions and person-to-person contact made possible by the conference.

         Economic benefits also flowed as a direct result of the conference. The Canberra Visitor and Convention Bureau estimated that the conference visitors spent $5.2 million during their stay and gave the local Canberra economy a considerable boost. Within Parliament House, comparative September figures indicate that overseas delegates spent $30,000, or 2.7 times the previous year's amount, in the Parliament Shop during the main six days of the conference. I do not think Aussie did too badly, either.

         I would like to thank honourable members for the hospitality they extended to our visitors during the week of the conference; particularly those who made their offices available for the use of IPU staff from Geneva. Conference participants were all greatly impressed by Parliament House and its facilities and expressed their gratitude to the Australian parliament for making them available to the conference. They were even more fulsome in their praise for the excellent organisation of the conference which was often described as the best that had been experienced at IPU level.

         The conference coordinator, Anne Hazelton, deserves congratulations for her role in organising the conference. She and the staff of the secretariat have worked tirelessly over many months to ensure that the conference would run as smoothly as it did. Conference delegates were also greatly impressed by the thoughtfulness and hospitality extended throughout the week by the many parliamentary staff who volunteered to work on the conference. Many delegates commented on the friendliness of those who assisted them so generously in so many ways. On behalf of the parliament, I extend our special appreciation to the staff of this institution for a magnificent job.

         The impression that delegates will take back to their respective countries will reflect their experiences here. They will return with a heightened awareness of the beauty of the country, the friendliness of the people and the diversity of skills on offer. I have no doubt that in the long term these impressions will enhance Australia's relations with many nations and bring with them substantial economic and social benefits.

On behalf of all those involved, I say that the conference can be measured as nothing short of successful. Again, I thank all those who gave of their time so freely.

        —On behalf of the Australian delegation to the IPU Conference and the Australian parliament, I would like to say how successful the conference was. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to pass on to all the staff of the parliamentary departments the good wishes of the House for the excellent job that they did in preparing and conducting this conference. I have been to a few IPU conferences over the years. As a member of the IPU executive, I have seen the way in which a number of countries have prepared for the conference. I think it can be fairly said that delegates went away from the conference here in Canberra with a very warm view that this was one of the best IPU conferences in recent years.

        As you have said, Mr Speaker, I think a great deal of the credit goes to Anne Hazelton, who coordinated the conference. I know that, when we went to the conference in Sweden last year, Anne went as the delegation secretary and thought that she would not be able to put on a conference in the way that the Swedes did. But I am sure that the view of delegates to this conference was that it was as good as, if not better than, the conference in Stockholm. The parliamentary staff, Anne Hazelton in particular and the people who worked closely with Anne in running this conference, deserve the congratulations of the House.

        I also thank the members of the Australian delegation. In particular, I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who was the deputy leader of the delegation, and other members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate who participated in the conference. The conference passed a number of important resolutions. There was a significant discussion on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a long way away from our part of the world, but it is really, as members of this parliament have said in recent resolutions, one of the great human rights sores on the face of the earth at present. To see people who are from countries that are near Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also to enter into dialogue with people from Serbia and Montenegro, who in the views of many are the ones who are causing the problem, was useful for all of us.

I think it showcased the things that Australia has to offer, and sent back to Europe, Africa, Asia and other corners of the world people with a very strong idea that, in Australia, we have a very vibrant democracy, we have a country that is worth while listening to and a country that is certainly worth while seeing. Our people here added the gloss to that, so thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

        On a personal level, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your chairing of the plenary sessions. A number of delegates from other countries commented to me how much you appeared to be enjoying yourself and also on how well you did carry out your task. Many delegates stated to me, as I am sure they did to all members of the Australian delegation, that it was the best organised IPU conference they had ever attended. It is very hard when one is participating in a conference hosted by one's own country to draw that sort of judgment, but so many who had had extensive experience of other IPU conferences said it that in the end I was pleased to accept that compliment on your behalf, Mr Speaker.

        Anne Hazelton is, of course, to be congratulated on her excellent organising. Ms Hazelton went to an IPU conference for the first time in Sweden, 12 months ago. She went to the conference in India in April this year under extremely difficult circumstances. We had a very small delegation. I had to pull out from that delegation only a couple of days beforehand; I think Senator Colston was the only parliamentarian who went. He became very ill very early in that conference. Ms Hazelton also became extremely ill whilst in India, and was off work very ill for quite some time after returning to Australia. So her own prior experience of IPU conferences was rather mixed. However, she worked—as she always does—with great charm and ability. Her organisation, as I have said, was excellent.

        I want to pay a very special tribute to the staff of Parliament House who were pressed into very special service over the days of the conference. If honourable menbers had come to the parliament or even the airport in that period, they would have been greeted by familiar faces in unfamiliar garb. Staff were wearing rather large grey hats—which were a cross between a stetson and an Akubra—and either a very bright scarf or a tie in blue and gold. A few diffident Australian males tucked the tie into their coat pocket and let a little of it show to identify them, preferring not to wear in the place one would expect what is really a very attractive tie.

        Over those days, we all had a certain amount of contact with these staff, who did everything possible to smooth the way for delegates. They were allotted to delegates as escorts, and were everywhere to help and guide them. Speaking personally, I could have burst with pride; they did an absolutely magnificent job and I cannot speak highly enough of them.

        I ought to report that the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians meeting—which Mr Speaker mentioned—on the Sunday preceding the conference was attended by approximately 100 delegates, both men and women. This meeting is held the day before the official opening so that the women parliamentarians could get together to do some pre-study of items on the agenda. We then come up with suggestions of matters to be included in draft motions to be put to the conference at the end of the week with respect to the subjects being debated so as to make sure that those aspects that are of particular concern to women—to women and children, need I say—are included for consideration. It also ensures that women are on the drafting committees and playing their proper role in the conference. As I have said, male MPs are very welcome to come to this meeting, and a number of them do. Also, of course, there are a number of advisers.

        I want to pay my own personal tribute to Robyn McClelland, an employee of the House of Representatives, who worked very closely with me in the four weeks preceding the conference organising the women's meeting. She worked very hard and very efficiently indeed. I also want to thank those outsiders who participated in Sunday's opening ceremony—namely, a women's choir from Canberra called Cyrenes which sang a number of original songs of particular interest to women, and also Matilda House, who is an elder of the Aboriginal tribe whose land this was and in fact still is.

        Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to read into the parliamentary record the poem that she read that day. I encountered this poem quite by chance only a couple of weeks before the opening ceremony. Through Anne Hazelton's very hard work, we were able to identify Matilda and have this poem included in the ceremony. I want to read it into the record because it has a particular significance to this House, and I want everybody in this House to know of the facts that it conveys. It conveys simply this: there was a time when this hill—which we call Capital Hill—was called Kurrajong by the local Aboriginal tribe, and it was a sacred site for the women. It was to this hill that the Aboriginal women came to sing their songs. A Canberra woman, Dorothy Cameron, who knew of this and who knew Senator Jo Vallentine, wrote this poem as a tribute to the women of Capital Hill—past, present and probably future—to mark the occasion of Senator Vallentine's resignation from the Senate. Senator Vallentine read it into the Senate

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, this package—the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and six cognate bills—gives effect to the measures announced in the government's `Strengthening Super Security' statement of 21 October last year The bills replace legislation which was first introduced last year but which lapsed with the proroguing of the last parliament. In addition, the government released a number of amendments on 15 September of this year which make two major additions to the legislation and a number of minor technical changes.

         The bills introduce far-reaching changes to the regulation and prudential supervision of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts in Australia. Measures contained in the bills reflect the government's objective of ensuring that Australians increasingly provide for their own retirement, and also reflect a conviction on the part of the government that superannuation is the preferred savings vehicle by which such provision is to be made.

         The bills largely repeal Labor's Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987, which until now has been the principal piece of legislation regulating the operation of superannuation funds in Australia. The Occupational Superannuation Standards Act sought to regulate superannuation funds indirectly by granting tax concessions only to funds that complied with certain minimum standards specified in that act.

         The new Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill, or SIS legislation, will seek instead to directly regulate and control the activities of the superannuation funds through the use of the corporations and pensions powers in the constitution. I might add that some doubts have been expressed about the constitutional basis for this legislation, particularly in the absence of a referral of powers from the states. These doubts are not especially serious, however, and should not threaten this legislation to the same extent as the constitutional problems that have surrounded the government's ill-fated and misnamed Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill.

         The legislation represents a major change to the legal basis for the regulation and prudential supervision of superannuation funds in this country. To date, superannuation funds have relied largely on trust law and common law precedents to guide them in their operations. There have been relatively few statutory requirements, despite the mass of superannuation legislation of recent years which has largely been concerned with defining the tax treatment of superannuation savings.

         Most of the considerable uncertainty that has plagued superannuation in recent years has emanated from these often changing statutory requirements and taxation measures. The legislation largely overturns the existing legal basis for superannuation fund operations and replaces it with the type of black letter law that now characterises the new corporations law that has been introduced with mixed success.

         The new black letter law will be administered by a better resourced and more powerful Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, rather than the Australian Securities Commission, which currently supervises superannuation entities. The new legislation will apply to superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, ADFs, and pooled superannuation trusts, PSTs, from 1 July 1994, the starting date having been extended from that contained in the original legislation to allow superannuation funds and trustees more time to come to grips with the changes that must be made to their operations.

         The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill gives new powers to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to enforce a host of new measures dealing with the obligations and prudential requirements to be placed on superannuation funds and their trustees. The ISC will be given sweeping powers in carrying out this role, including the right of entry, access to documents, the execution of search warrants, and the conduct of interviews.

         The bill will enable the ISC to approve, suspend and remove trustees, and to set the standards for the trustees and investment managers of superannuation funds. The ISC will promulgate regulations prescribing, in detail, appropriate standards with which superannuation funds will be forced to comply. The compliance status of superannuation funds will be confirmed by notices issued by the ISC, and to this end trustees will be required to lodge annual returns with the commission. The ISC will be able to issue stop orders against any superannuation vehicle's advertisements or promotional material, and will be able to order investment managers not to dispose of certain assets.

A range of other duties will be imposed on trustees and investment managers which will not form part of the trust deed, however. Restrictions are imposed on the acquisition of certain assets, as well as the amount of in-house assets that may be held by superannuation funds.

A range of severe penalties is provided for in the case of false, misleading or fraudulent conduct by trustees or fund managers in the conduct of a superannuation entity, as well as for failure to comply with the prudential and other standards provided for in the legislation. Superannuation entities that have suffered losses because of fraudulent conduct may be entitled to financial assistance as a result of this legislation, and a new levy on superannuation funds is provided to finance such assistance.

         The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill establishes a new superannuation complaints tribunal. This body will seek to resolve complaints by fund members or the beneficiaries of funds about the decisions made by trustees where those decisions may be unfair, unreasonable or beyond power. The tribunal will first attempt to conciliate the complaints, before taking measures to review the trustee's decision. In this regard, the tribunal proceedings will not be bound by the rules of procedure and evidence and, as an administrative body, the tribunal will have no enforcement powers. So questions of law will have to be referred to the Federal Court.

         The opposition has some concerns and reservations about certain aspects of the legislation, and we will be raising these in due course. However, these concerns can be addressed within the overall framework of the government's legislation. It should be noted that this legislation will be introduced at considerable cost to the superannuation funds and, by extension, to the retirement benefits of all affected Australians. There will be notable costs associated with the changeover to the new system of prudential supervision and regulation. There will also be a number of ongoing costs which will have to be met as a result of this legislation, and which will make superannuation a relatively expensive savings vehicle.

         The legislation is timely, given Labor's determination to entrench superannuation as its preferred savings vehicle for all Australians. But when one says `preferred savings vehicle', one is really talking about the preferences of the Labor Party, rather than the preferences of individual Australians, since the government has set about making provision for superannuation compulsory for all Australians. Superannuation is no longer a matter of choice and, with the vast flow of money into superannuation funds, it is appropriate that the government should take measures to ensure that superannuation savings are appropriately regulated and protected.

         The government's stated intention is that all Australians will increasingly provide for their own retirements, and so reduce what would otherwise be a massive increase in social security payments as an increasing proportion of our population reaches retirement age in the years ahead. Whether the government's superannuation policies will actually achieve this goal is a matter of debate, given the large number of questions about superannuation policies that have yet to be resolved.

         At least with this legislation the government has finally answered the question of how it proposes to regulate the vast increase in superannuation fund assets that is currently taking place. This question had gone begging up until late last year when the government handed down the statement to which I referred earlier.

         The principal challenge facing the government in drawing up this legislation has been to provide an appropriate level of protection to the retirement savings of Australians without imposing undue costs on the superannuation funds—costs which must ultimately be met out of the potential retirement benefits of members. Only time will tell whether the government has struck an appropriate balance in this regard. It should be noted that superannuation is already a high cost savings vehicle that is already heavily regulated, albeit indirectly, by the Commonwealth government.

The family home is easily the largest single investment most Australians will ever make and yet it is almost totally unregulated—and rightly so.

The coalition, along with a number of superannuation industry commentators, has a number of reservations about some of the detail in this legislation. There is a widespread concern about the operation of clause 62 of the bill which prevents superannuation funds acquiring assets from members. It is acknowledged that this provision is designed to prevent a variety of abuses that can be perpetrated. In so doing, however, it proscribes a number of legitimate arrangements on the part of self-employed people who may legitimately want to place some of their business assets in their super funds.

         Seven superannuation bills are being debated cognately in the House today. In my view, they will result in increased prudential protection being provided for the superannuation industry. That is extremely important. Taken together, they represent a substantial strengthening of the security of superannuation savings and the protection of the rights of superannuation fund members. Over many decades, superannuation will have a huge savings pool. The recent report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on safeguarding superannuation highlights the growth that we anticipate in the superannuation industry over the next few years, certainly to the year 2000. The report indicates that there will be in excess of $600 billion in superannuation funds; so it is certainly very important that we have the right mechanism in place to ensure that those superannuation funds are protected.

He suggested they were doing these things on a non-honorary basis. I think it is very important that trustees and investment managers are professional people in their own way and take the positions very seriously. When one is dealing with people's retirement funds and the savings of many workers, it is important that those trustees and the investment managers are really on the job and have a very strong understanding and commitment to the protection of those funds. So the trustees and the investment managers are obligated under the bill to manage funds responsibly and they must be suitable to act as fund trustees. It is extremely important. If funds suffer a loss as a result of a fraud or a theft, they  will receive financial assistance from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.

They certainly would be elected in their own way and certainly the trade union movement has a keen interest in the rights of their members in protecting their funds. The trade union movement has been very responsible in its attitude towards superannuation over many years and it has a very clear commitment to ensuring that its members have security in retirement.

         In addition to the measures that this government has taken to encourage increased use in superannuation, it has been keen for the increase of savings in many other areas as well. This government has not forgotten those. It is often suggested that superannuation is the only thing that we have been concentrating on. We are well aware of the need for people to continue saving in many areas. The honourable member for Curtin talked about how a lot of people put the bulk of their savings into their own home. That is a great Australian tradition and the people in Australia have always wanted to own their own home and it is a goal that they can still achieve, and rightly so. But it is important that whilst people have their own home in their working lives they manage to maintain those homes. It is also very important that when they come to retire they have sufficient income in retirement to be able to maintain those homes and their lives with the dignity they expect.

         There is no doubt that over time we cannot maintain the levels of pension payments that we have maintained now. This government has a very good record in increasing the aged pensions to above 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings—that has been a big boost. But as our population ages—and everybody realises that, the statistics are clearly there—it would be very difficult for any government to maintain those sorts of pensions in the longer term. But where people can provide superannuation for their own retirement, I suggest to the House that those people have the opportunity to provide much greater income in their retirement. It is important to maintain a high income in retirement so that people can live with the dignity which they expect.

         There are certainly a lot of issues in the area of national savings when it comes to housing, ordinary savings, banks, superannuation, and a number of areas that I will not canvass here today. Australia, being such a vast country with a relatively small population, has long suffered a problem of a low savings base. This in turn has resulted in inadequate capital being available to the private sector for investment purposes. Superannuation no doubt will provide an area for investment in the future, provided superannuation is invested wisely in the best interests of the members. That is an important thing that we must look at as well.

         Last year the federal government commissioned Dr Vince FitzGerald to investigate alternative policies to encourage increased national savings. The FitzGerald report, released on 29 June, contained a number of proposals. A letter sent by Dr FitzGerald to the Treasurer on 5 July contained more specific policy proposals. In response to this report the 1993-94 budget sets out a thorough strategy designed to increase national savings. This strategy builds on the advances made under this government in increasing savings for retirement in the form of superannuation. The FitzGerald report contained a number of proposals for the superannuation system. Specifically, Dr FitzGerald raised a number of pertinent points in relation to the superannuation guarantee charge introduced by the government last year. The government has recognised that there are a number of problems with the superannuation guarantee charge and the Treasurer has made the resolution of these difficulties one of his top priorities.

         On 17 August, the Treasury released a statement, `National Savings and Superannuation', which details the action taken by government to implement the recommendation of Dr FitzGerald's report. In relation to superannuation policy, Dr FitzGerald proposed the government release a final policy statement on superannuation retirement income policy by the middle of 1994. He proposed that the policy include a reduction in the lump sum threshold to around $50,000 and, to ensure that lump sums are counted as for the age pension income and assets test, that a proportion of benefits over that threshold be taken in the form of income streams and to treat such streams for Department of Social Security tax purposes.

         Dr FitzGerald further recommended the raising of the pensionable age for women to 65 over a 10- to 15-year period, with access for long-term unemployed people from age 60. In response to these recommendations, the Treasurer announced in the national savings and superannuation statement that the government would not be reducing the taxation threshold for lump sum superannuation from its present level of $77,796 as there was little benefit in reducing the threshold, which would also be retrospective in its impact.

         The government is at present undertaking a process of consultation on the superannuation matters raised by Dr FitzGerald and preparing a detailed response to its proposals for release in early 1994. Also, in response to Dr FitzGerald's recommendations in relation to retirement incomes policy, the government has announced the raising of the age pension age for women from 60 to 65 over a 20-year period, which of course was announced in the budget. Dr FitzGerald also proposed that the government review its decision to allow diversion of compulsory superannuation savings into housing, saying that if the proposal were to proceed it should be subject to tight age or other restrictions, such as its being the buyer's first home, and should perhaps be linked to the introduction of employee contributions and/or improvements in a regime for voluntary individual superannuation contributions.

         It is clear from the government's approach over the past decades and its response to the recommendations of the FitzGerald report on national savings that it is determined to increase the access of the Australian work force to superannuation as well as encouraging our overall national savings effort. In order to achieve these twin objectives, the government has accepted the international evidence that a successful superannuation system cannot be built on purely voluntary contributions. Under a voluntary system, only people on higher incomes would be able to accumulate enough superannuation to provide adequately for their retirement. Unfortunately, those opposite have never allowed themselves to learn this lesson.

         The coalition's current retirement incomes policy ignores the three basic issues in superannuation policy. The first of these issues is that Australia faces an increasingly ageing population. If we as a society continue to rely solely on the age pension, future governments will either have to reduce the benefits received by pensioners or increase the taxation imposed on future generations. It is the responsibility of government to take steps in order to ensure that our citizens will have access to adequate income levels in retirement, and perhaps we should have done this many years ago. In essence, coalition policy ignores this by leaving it up to the market forces.

         The superannuation policy of those opposite would have resulted in the standards prior to 1983 being reintroduced with superannuation once again becoming the preserve of the rich and public sector workers who are the ones who generally receive superannuation. In essence, the opposition's superannuation policy at the last election combined voluntary contributions with a 25 per cent tax rebate with a higher tax on super fund earnings and an increased tax rate on lump sums received by 55- to 59-year olds. Relying on tax concessions to encourage people to provide for their own retirement, as proposed by the opposition, has not worked in the past in Australia or anywhere else in the world, and it is a lesson we should all learn.

         This government has retained the concessional tax rebate of 15 per cent on superannuation fund earnings, which is effectively seven to eight per cent after imputation credits. Those opposite, according to their policy, want to tax them at 20 per cent, which would substantially reduce the final value of superannuation savings. This would lower the relative attractiveness of superannuation as a form of savings and, coupled with making superannuation voluntary, would effectively destroy the present broadly based superannuation system which this government has worked so very hard to achieve over the last decade.

         In summary, this package of legislation actually builds on this government's present proud record of reform to superannuation over the past decade. I believe that these bills before us today—I  will not mention them all again because there are seven of them—will ensure that Australians will have a good, solid superannuation industry in the future where it will be a safe place for workers to invest their money for their retirement and that in the future all Australians will be able to live on a much broader income in retirement than they have now. I think that these bills will be able to achieve that.

         —Whilst I do not question the sincerity of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) in talking about giving people funds, dignity and money to assist them in their retirement, he is ignoring the facts of this particular scheme to date. Although the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and six cognate superannuation bills deal with supervisory and credential measures associated with the entire superannuation industry, which I will refer to shortly, the simple fact is that one of the great disasters of the Keating government's administration has been the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge. As the honourable member for Oxley should well know, the government is not delivering accumulated funds for the people he would like to help, notwithstanding that I agree he would like to help them.

If he were to go back to his electorate and ask some of his constituents, particularly those in part-time and itinerant work, to ask their guaranteed compulsory super fund to provide them with a net value of their superannuation contributions, they would in most cases find that it is something like 50 per cent of employer contributions—not 50 per cent of employer contributions plus interest but 50 per cent of employer contributions.

         The scheme is not working. It is having very debilitating effects. The scheme does nothing for those who do not have a job. They get no guarantee whatsoever. They do not even get 50 per cent of nothing. More importantly, it adds to their numbers. I refer in this regard to the survey done by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It is quite authoritative and has not been contested by anybody. The survey points out that some 60,000 jobs have been lost since the introduction of this scheme that are attributable to the scheme. In the first instance, we find a large number of people whose retirement prospects have deteriorated significantly because they do not have a job any more. The government was warned about this at the time and chose to ignore it because the instructions had come from on high; Bill Kelty wanted it.

         Why were we told we needed this scheme? We were told we had to re-establish national savings. We can look at some evidence as to how that has succeeded. Money has been flowing in—$1.7 billion from small businesses alone in the private sector. What has happened to national savings? After roughly a year of this money flowing into the coffers, plus what went in before under union superannuation, in March we recorded our eighth consecutive quarter of negative growth in private savings in Australia. Savings have been going down every month. A survey conducted by the ANZ Bank, headed `National savings fall in March quarter', stated:

        National savings fell by 1 per cent of GDP . . .

        That is a mere billion dollars. While people were forcibly made to put a billion dollars into superannuation which they could not afford, we find that savings fell by a billion dollars anyway. So the system does not seem to be very successful in that regard. The ANZ report covered the March quarter 1993. It went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Private sector saving rose to 3.5 per cent of GDP ($3.5 billion) while public sector dissaving stabilised in trend terms at 4.4 per cent of GDP ($4.5 billion), following fourteen consecutive quarters of decline.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        In that sense it was positive. The situation is that it has not contributed to national savings in an overall sense because the government, amongst others, is in there borrowing money as though that practice was about to go out of fashion.

But what have they done? What is their solution? They want to tax business even further.

         In rebutting the statements of the honourable member for Oxley, I make two points: firstly, this measure has done very little for workers and, secondly, it is doing even less for national savings. There are some other substantial issues to be addressed in that regard, one of which is the fact that in this process we have started to see the incentives for people investing in private superannuation being whittled down. We now know that people on incomes of up to $30,000 who earn any part of that income subject to the superannuation guarantee charge—if only 10 per cent of their income attracts the superannuation guarantee payment—will lose all of their previous tax deductions bar the $100 rebate.

They did not spend it in the pub; they added it to give themselves the sort of benefit the honourable member for Oxley spoke about. Suddenly they get a letter in the mail saying, `No more of this. You will pay full tax. Your PAYE has been ratcheted up to where it was. If you try to bail out of your superannuation, you will lose the lot'.

         I might say—I hope the message gets out—that the same will apply to many jockeys who see themselves as independent contractors. They have made their own superannuation arrangements. Some of those who are better paid and have higher incomes could lose all their tax deductions for a lousy couple of bucks which will flow in every now and again under this scheme. One might wonder what the tax man is up to. I think he is more inclined to get rid of the tax deductions of the better-off jockeys than see a general distribution of superannuation in this area. It is extending its tentacles. As I said, the parliament has instructed the commissioner, and he sees himself as having a job to do.

         I make special reference to clause 62(1) of the bill. It makes sense if a bureaucrat does not know how a small business operates. In essence, the clause prevents funds purchasing assets that are the property of a member. That is done for good reason. There is historic evidence that such assets have been overvalued in funds and fraud has been perpetrated. The clause overlooks the fact that one of the better types of funds for a small business is its own. Frequently, there are no employees involved other than the members of the family. They should be able to get some of the benefits of superannuation and the tax deductibility that remains. From personal experience, I know that very few small businessmen are able to take advantage of the tax deductibility available for superannuation investment in cash simply because they have never got the cash. They lack the cash flow to invest in this and get the sorts of deductions that are available to others.

         If they could set up a proper superannuation scheme and buy some of their own assets, which could be good bricks and mortar, then they have got the opportunity to do something. But, as has been pointed out to me by certain business groups, if in doing that members had government bonds, mortgage loans at, say, 60 per cent of sworn value and things like that—good assets—why cannot there be a provision that allows them to be brought into the fund?

Some of the matters that have been advanced as to why the situation should be different are government bonds; interest bearing deposits with banks and building societies—they are not lousy investments just because they happen to belong to a member of the fund; advances by first mortgage, as I have just pointed out, at 66.66 per cent of valuation; shares and other securities listed on the stock exchange; life assurance policies, et cetera.

But we should be encouraging small businesses. Why can they not have their own superannuation fund because their assets are only $1 million? Those are the sorts of things that need to be addressed in this legislation.

I think at times they have been guilty of ramping it. They invest in the currency market. That is a big help—making dollars and manipulating foreign currencies. They eventually invest in supermarkets and tall office buildings—and that does not help their policyholders much either in recent times as that particular market has been overinflated.

I do not see why people cannot invest for a little while in their own houses. It is a very necessary part of retirement. Why can they not buy a second unit of accommodation, putting their money into a tax free investment, and rent it to someone? It will always be worth more than the money in a super fund because it will always keep up with inflation. Why does the government not open its mind a bit?

         —The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and six cognate bills that are being dealt with at the present time represent a fairly logical extension to a number of changes and innovations which have been built into the superannuation arrangements in Australia by this government. The most innovative period in the history of the Commonwealth in superannuation and superannuation provisions has been the period since 1983 when the present government came into office. In light of very comprehensive, sometimes very complex and generally very effective changes that have been introduced into the superannuation scheme, it is appropriate that at this stage of an industry which has grown so rapidly and so significantly and will increasingly be an important part of the total Australian arrangement, particularly retirement incomes, we consider prudential protections for superannuation funds.

         I did not hear all of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), but one of his observations was that we have to re-establish national savings. The necessity for Australia to do that was certainly referred to in the recent FitzGerald report, for a whole complex of reasons. But I am surprised that a comment of that sort would have been made in connection with this set of bills relating to this industry. One of the most important things that superannuation and superannuation contributions do is to build national savings. I will say more about that shortly.

         I think the honourable member for O'Connor also misrepresented the nature of the award based superannuation. He suggested that, particularly for smaller businesses, this represented some type of burden. In fact, the three per cent productivity trade-off for employer contributions to superannuation arrangements for their employees in the first place represented a willingness—a declared willingness on the part of the ACTU at that time—on the part of employees to make a contribution not out of the profits of businesses or the revenue of employers but out of the wages which otherwise would have found their way into their own pockets. It was recognised that it was a three per cent productivity gain which employees were entitled to. They did not receive that three per cent. That was the three per cent which went into the superannuation funds in order to kick off what now is developing in a very substantial way, and will between now and the end of the century develop even more substantially, to ensuring that employees would have an opportunity to contribute towards their own retirement incomes.

Of course, making provisions to ensure that people do not lose their money as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft is an essential element of any type of arrangement which involves people's rights; particularly when those arrangements have been encouraged by government. There is obviously a responsibility on the part of governments to ensure that those prudential provisions are in place and that people who are contributing their own funds towards arrangements such as superannuation will have their interests adequately protected.

         It is obvious that there is a need to provide more adequately for retirement incomes to provide people in the years of their retirement with a greater level of security than they would otherwise enjoy. What I want to make sure of, and what I hope future governments will make sure of, is that the compulsory contribution superannuation funds are not used as a means for government to reduce its responsibility towards people in retirement.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I remember that you in particular were aware, at the time that these provisions were being developed, that one of the reasons given for compulsory superannuation was to encourage supplementation of people's old age pension entitlement. We need then to make sure that the old age pension entitlement remains at least at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, so that the contribution to superannuation funds which people are making now, during the period that they are earning income, should be used more directly to provide a supplement to the pension that they would otherwise be entitled to. If we do that, those people will have greater dignity, security and purchasing power in their retirement. Therefore, in a material sense at least, they will be more adequately able to enjoy their retirement, as they should.

         Today, for every one person receiving an age or a service pension, there are approximately six people in the work force who are paying taxes and producing the revenue needed to meet the costs of the social security system. In 30 years time, it is estimated that for every one person on a pension, there will only be three people in the work force. So the number of people in the work force available to support, in a sense, that one person on a pension will decline over the next 30 years from six to three.

         Age pension outlays during that time will increase from the current level of about 2.5 per cent of GDP to a little over five per cent. So that will double as well if the single pension entitlement is maintained at or about 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. I believe that it should be maintained, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that you support this contention, as does the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has been a very powerful, strong and continuing advocate for the retirement security of Australians through superannuation arrangements.

I remind everyone that, as far as the opposition is concerned, the situation which prevailed before we came into government in 1983—and took the opportunity to build greater security, equity, protection and retirement incomes into the system—had, of course, been the result of measures which had been taken or had often failed to be taken by the coalition when it was in government. Prior to that award based superannuation to which I made reference, less than 40 per cent of employees in Australia had access to any superannuation at all.

         With conservative coalition parties in government, there is no doubt that that 40 per cent would have represented the highest income earners in the Australian work force. Low income earners were rejected and neglected by former conservative coalition governments. Not only was it the highest income earners who had access to superannuation; twice as many males as females had access. It was not only an example of income discrimination, but also an example of gender discrimination. It took a Labor government, through all of the changes that have been introduced since 1983, to bring greater equity into the system and to rip out, wherever possible, those examples of discrimination. Less than 40 per cent of people in the work force in 1983 had access to superannuation; now 80 per cent of full-time workers have some cover as a result of these changes that have been introduced.

         I said earlier that this government has been undoubtedly the most innovative government ever in the development of superannuation. I know that there have been criticisms as a result of the number of changes to superannuation. People have said, `Why don't you let it settle down?' I would endorse that type of approach, but a whole range of changes has been introduced into a system which is of fundamental importance to Australians—either people in retirement or people looking forward to their retirement. Changes have been introduced into the way in which retirement incomes and superannuation funds are being applied. As the system itself becomes more sophisticated and more complex, as the details are more clearly identified and dealt with, I do not think it is very surprising that there will be changes—and probably fairly frequent changes, as there have been since 1983. I believe that we have reached the stage now where a lot of those problems have been ironed out, and the whole area should start to settle down. But there is a need for governments to upgrade, modify, extend and refine policies in the light of all of those changes that have taken place.

         There are a number of important elements in superannuation reform to be considered. The first is coverage: who will be covered; to what extent; how will the contributions be made; how should they be held; how will the earnings on those funds be taxed between the time that the contribution is made and the time that the retirement benefit is secured. But just as important—and in many respects even more important—is the question of prudential controls. We have to make sure that in comprehensive arrangements of this kind we minimise loss by protecting the rights of members against possible fraud, theft or, in some cases, incompetence. Some elements of this legislation repeal those prudential provisions that were made in earlier legislation. Because this has been more refined, it is much more effective. We will deal with those questions in a much more successful way.

         The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was established in June 1991, and it did some great work. The honourable member for Chifley mentioned something that I was going to refer to, and that is the credit which is due to the first chairman of that committee—Senator Nick Sherry—who is now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. That committee did some very valuable work. Some of the reports that it issued were of great importance to the development of legislation. This government has taken advantage of those reports and of many of the findings that those reports contain. Credit goes to Nick Sherry for what he and the committee did over that period.

         —I enter this debate on superannuation with certain mixed feelings. While I have no doubt that the major problem Australia faces at the moment is a need for national savings, I hesitate to suggest that the collection of national savings can be completed by the superannuation system—both the employer guarantee levy system and the self-funded system. I recently worked on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. One of the witnesses before the committee suggested that 10 years down the track we would be looking at the superannuation funds industry in exactly the same way that we were looking at the major banking institutions at that time. I believe that that will be the case, and these seven bills certainly provide a framework.

         I am afraid that the execution of the duties of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission under these regulations will be very similar to the execution of duties by a lot of other institutions and commissions. The Australian Securities Commission, for instance, hesitates to make an inquiry on a matter that involves less than $500,000. Anything below that is not significant enough for it to spend its resources on. As a result of that, there has been persecution by that commission in certain areas. I believe that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which will be charged with prudential supervision, will end up exactly the same.

         I do not know how many superannuation funds there are in Australia. I am led to believe that there are thousands. To suggest that we can fund a bureaucracy big enough to be efficient in the discharge of its duties is nonsensical. I am taking the general ambit claim, as the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) invited me to do, and that is to look at it generally. I think we have to start on that premise. We have to look at what things have happened around us in the past within this parliament, at the bodies that we have set up, and at the physical impossibility for them to handle it. One might even suggest that the Reserve Bank, which has a smaller area of responsibility, finds difficulty in providing the prudential supervision of the banks that it is charged with providing. That position pales into insignificance against what we are doing with this legislation.

         As I said, I have no complaint—and neither does the opposition—with the argument that national savings are imperative. That need is highlighted in Australia at the moment for two reasons. Firstly, there is a higher reliance on social security by way of the age and veterans pension when those who have reached that stage have not been able to fund their retirement. I think the honourable member for Charlton mentioned that the figure was 11 per cent of the population. That is a huge amount to start with. We are starting behind the eight ball. Secondly, Australia places an emphasis on the accumulation of foreign capital because we lack the national savings necessary for our own investment purposes. I think that is absolutely tragic.

Australians do not have the capacity to invest. In my own electorate, two very small meatworks went up for sale. The price wanted was $70 million. The graziers tried right across Australia to raise the funds for the meatworks, but they were unable to do so. Eventually, the graziers fell captive to a 70 per cent investment of foreign capital—namely, capital from Japanese investors. We were able to raise only 30 per cent. So there is no complaining about the need for national savings.

         At this point I might add that the manner in which we accrue national savings is hampered in many ways at the moment, mostly by government intervention, and particularly through taxation. We hear people say that we have the lowest tax regime in the OECD, et cetera, et cetera—they can use any comparison they like—but people in the street know that they cannot afford to put money aside as savings because of other commitments. Taxation is just one of them.

The honourable member for Charlton might well decry the 11-year-old scheme, where only five per cent of the lump sum superannuation amount was taxed, because of abuses that occurred, but when one looks at the 27 or 30 changes to the method of taxation of those funds, the limits imposed on lump sums, and the way in which the government is now legislating in this area, I do not think that these bills will go any way towards increasing the level of national savings.

At the moment, the government, with its preoccupation with superannuation, does not recognise that people are expected to make a contribution for those not in work. On raw statistics, 11 per cent of Australians are presently out of work. If we add to that figure the number of people underemployed and who would like to get into a better job, we reach a figure of 20 per cent.

         I have had reason to question an insurance company very closely about the premature discharge of a policy where a chap was seeking a replacement heart. A person looking for a replacement heart at the age of 40 or 45 would provide pretty good evidence that he was in dire circumstances and was not likely to work again. In spite of the trustees of that fund saying over and over again that they supported the employee's right to take out those funds prematurely, that person has to live on sickness benefits. He cannot afford to pay his car repayments or his house redemption on sickness benefits; whereas if that amount was made available to him, he could.

         These companies must have tighter control of their agents. For example, Brisbane agents of a company have had some difficulty in fulfilling their agency agreement. The insurance company did nothing when faced with blatant abuse by the agent. The company stood aside and said that the issue was between the agents and the agency, and it would not come into it. If it is fair that the companies are going to be supervised by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, then it is just as important that there is a peer recognition amongst the insurance companies that they have a responsibility to the person they are insuring. The responsibility applies to all staff, including agencies. The manner in which they respond will be a measure of how much the companies are prepared to take on board the need for this closer supervision.

         The superannuation industry, and the plight of people in relation to national savings, is not helped by the example we set within the parliamentary superannuation system. There are two classes of people in Australia at the moment: those who do very well out of superannuation, and those who are being forced into superannuation and who will never do well under it. While we act as the pacesetters with our parliamentary superannuation—a scheme which is far too generous, and which has a natural flow-on to the Public Service, which I believe is also generous—and while those funds are not paid for or contributed to by the government, it leaves Australia in the very delicate position of having more liabilities than are being disclosed. At the changeover from the old Trans Australia Airlines scheme to the new scheme this government had to put in $177 million to make sure that it was actually funded at the time.

But we do not have that scheme. The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said that the government can be well satisfied with the initiatives it has taken in terms of superannuation, because prior to its activities the only people who had superannuation were public servants, and people in middle management in private enterprise—mostly male, definitely not female—and only 40 per cent of the population was covered. In introducing our award superannuation of three per cent employer funding, rising to nine per cent with an employee contribution of three per cent, we have extended that coverage by almost 100 per cent. Of course, it is desirable that all people be covered.

Admittedly, Singapore does not have social security, and it does not have a lot of other things that we take for granted, but it does have a pretty impressive national savings scheme with a 25 per cent employer contribution and a 25 per cent employee contribution. Could I just repeat that: 25 per cent employer and 25 per cent employee. That has recently been reduced to 20 per cent. That is a massive engine room of savings, and with that sort of contribution coming from both employers and employees it is understandable that money can be borrowed to buy houses, or, more correctly, flats in Singapore.

         In developing its supervisory regime, some principles have been developed. The first principle is to increase, but not guarantee, the safety of members' benefits. The government will not guarantee superannuation benefits to members because, rightly, that is the responsibility of trustees and fund managers.

         This legislation provides for greater member participation. For example, superannuation funds are operated for the benefit of their members. The government places considerable weight on the role played by members in the management of funds. Currently, members do not have that option.

         It is always interesting in a debate on superannuation to see how the opposition objects to the union movement having developed, in the absence of other mechanisms, trade union funds. Whilst the building unions superannuation scheme was mentioned, I am more familiar with the National Union of Workers superannuation scheme which, by all accounts, has been an outstanding success and is to be commended. I wonder whether opposition members will deride that as they have the building unions superannuation fund.

         One of the most important ways in which members are able to participate in the management and protection of their retirement savings is through representation on the board of trustees. This legislation provides for equal representation. At the same time, small funds which consider equal representation to be impractical may opt for an independent trustee, providing the choice of trustee is by mutual agreement. Greater member participation means wider security of funds operation, consistent with the notion that the greater the number of watchful members, the smaller the risk of undetected fraud and negligence. This is a very important element in the overall changes the government is proposing.

         It is ironic that the other investment rules seem to have drawn the crabs from the opposition. These include that investments must be made at arms-length. The honourable member for O'Connor said that this was dreadful; that superannuation funds ought to be able to buy not at arms-length. There is a provision that in-house assets not exceed five per cent of the market value of the fund and that no loans be made to members or their relatives. What does the opposition object to in these provisions? There will be no acquisition of assets from members or their relatives.

         It is not just a matter of convenience for some of the smaller businesses, as the honourable member for O'Connor suggests. The issue here is that the public purse is involved through the concessionality of the taxation treatment of superannuation, and I think these rules are eminently sensible. They are certainly very much defendable for those who contribute, in the broad, to superannuation schemes.

         I find it very ironic that the opposition apparently is objecting to these rules, in particular to clause 62. There are enhanced requirements and obligations for funds in terms of the use of auditors, actuaries and professionals. I would have thought this to be very much in the best interests of those who contribute to funds and that it may assist the professionalism of the industry. Perhaps one of the most important innovations is the statutory complaints tribunal. Not only will the trustees of funds be required, as good administrative practice would determine, to have an internal complaints handling mechanism but, if this does not resolve the problem to the complainant's satisfaction, a statutory complaints tribunal will be set up, which would be independent and capable of arbitrating on complaints. These cognate bills will assist ordinary Australians by giving them confidence in superannuation and letting them know that their savings will be secure, that they will be fairly treated and that their superannuation funds will be invested effectively and productively.

         I want to respond to a few matters that have been raised. The honourable member for O'Connor raised the issue of insurance companies. I recall an example, AMP, which purports to be a good Australian company. It has a wholly owned subsidiary, Computer Science of Australia, which not only processes its computing requirements, but also is a very important defence contractor. The AMP proposed to sell 100 per cent of that company. It was not the situation that the honourable member for Dawson suggested of a cash starved organisation desperately embarking on a sell off campaign.

         The honourable member for O'Connor seems to take some delight in the fact that some small businesses, for whatever reason, have not been able to pay their superannuation contributions. Not paying those contributions, I point out, is a breach of the law. It affects their employees' prospective retirement. That any member of this chamber could wax lyrical about that, I find absolutely amazing. I have already mentioned the fact that the honourable member for O'Connor said that the unemployed are being left out of the award superannuation scheme. Of course they are.

         The recent three per cent employer superannuation contribution was given because the working men and women of Australia had not been receiving their just entitlements in terms of salary and wage increases. In lieu of awarding them that, the government and the Industrial Relations Commission developed award superannuation at a rate of three per cent. Strictly speaking, that should not be classified as an employer contribution, but as an employee contribution. We should be talking about a scheme that is balanced with six per cent employer and six per cent employee contributions, when fully developed. In the context of our current economic situation, we ought to review that and see whether it is enough and whether, in the national interest and the interests of people retiring in the future, that level should not be increased. The opposition has suggested that employers are unfairly bearing that cost impost—that is what is unfair. I support these bills.

         —Whilst there is much to commend in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and the six cognate superannuation bills before the House, there is much in the superannuation schemes in Australia today to classify them as grossly unfair and unjust to a large section of the community. They are unfair to migrants, part-time workers, women and unskilled workers. These are the people that the Australian Labor Party should be standing for. It has made a shambles of the superannuation scheme for those people it claims to represent. Those opposite should be ashamed of themselves.

         This legislation will force the funds and operators of funds to comply with some sort of management program that, as more and more money flows into the funds, will ensure that the trustees and other managers will be fair and conscientious in the treatment of employers' and employees' funds. This legislation applies to superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and superannuation trusts. It seeks to provide a framework of compliance. For superannuation funds, that means they need to comply with operating standards, the rules that govern them, borrowing rules, lending rules, the control and management of their in-house assets and the rules that apply to the assets they hold.

         These bills provide for equal representation or for management of the fund in a fair way. I would like to have the best people looking after my dough. I would not like Norm Gallagher or any of those roosters—or any of the yahoos in the union movement—looking after my money just because they have enough votes to muscle their way into a senior position. I would like the best managers to be looking after my money, not people who can bend an arm or force somebody to vote for them at union elections. It is just not on. Funds should not operate that way. They should have the best people, who are capable and have proved they can get the best results. So I have some concerns about equal representation rules.

         We had a blindingly brilliant speech from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) when he introduced this legislation. Those in the gallery must be absolutely absorbed by superannuation and the complexities of it—some of the people in the gallery are; I thank them for their acknowledgment. For those people who are not, they should have heard the speech of the parliamentary secretary on the introduction of this legislation. It was absolutely brilliant—the peak of oratory in this House—because he took the most boring parts of the explanatory memorandum that explains to us non-legal people what the act is really meant to do and he read them. He stood here and read them, and said that was a speech. I could not believe it. There was not an indication of government intention—not even a bit of propaganda. I could not believe it. Imagine the Australian Labor Party missing a chance for a bit of propaganda or patting itself on the back. It introduced this legislation out there in the community 27,000 times, if one reads its press releases, but the parliamentary secretary read the explanatory memorandum. I could not believe it.

         There is a need to refer to the explanatory memorandum to this act if one is to understand some of the processes that are to be undertaken in the legislation. I have covered some of them. I refer to the supervisory arrangements involving direct enforcement powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is going to be a pretty powerful group. It is the group that terrorised the pensioners and the retirees of Australia with its very unclever managing of the RBLs. For two years, we had every retiree in Australia not understanding how much money he had, where it was, who was looking after it and how much money he owed the government—incredible arrangements. The government forced retirees to accept the fact that they could not pay tax for 12 months because it would not tell them what their income was, and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission was behind it. The government would not tell them what their income was for 12 months, and here they are, terrified of being fined by a taxation commissioner with incredible powers. All the retirees are relying on for the taxation commissioner not moving in on them is a press release put out by him. Who would rely on his press releases? He is likely to change them, as the government is likely to change them. There is nothing in legislation.

Let us hope the commission will do a good job, but I warn it that I will be watching its activities in this area, just as I watched its activities with the management of the RBLs for the retirees, because I think it did an appalling job. It was absolutely appalling. People were swinging on a telephone for 1 1/2 to two hours, desperately trying to get information. Then those telephone lines were being closed down so that the employees there did not have to answer any of these nasty questions. It was terrible stuff. Then the telephone numbers were changed three days in a row so that people could not find out where to phone. I did not like that very much. I did not think it was very appropriate behaviour for government instrumentalities which are supposed to be providing information to behave in that way.

         I have come to the view that whilst I prefer the indirect method of control that we have had till now I can see that, as funds grow, there needs to be codification. The government, as is its want, has moved so strongly to provide a framework, but I think it has provided little direction. In fact, I would like to draw to the attention of the House some of the objections I have received to this legislation. I have had one from the Queensland government which says that it is concerned about the strength of some of this legislation and the immense power given to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. He can in fact almost make laws as he goes along, which has been one of the complaints. Nobody quite knows what he does but he is going to declare what he does, which is something like the taxation commissioner does.

         The Queensland government says that, under this legislation, the commission can wind up a scheme, freeze assets, suspend or remove a trustee body and a whole raft of other things. The government has legislated for the management of our money in some fund operated by some group of trustees. We are just saying, `We do not know what will happen there, but we will give a whole lot of power to the commissioner for insurance and superannuation'. That seems a strange way for a government to enter into a new scheme. It gives the power to the commissioner—this sounds like cops and robbers, it sounds a bit like the customs agencies and it sounds a bit like the Australian Federal Police—to enter premises, seize documents, conduct investigations into the affairs of a fund and determine an auditor is not suitable to audit a fund. The commission has pretty wide and far-reaching powers.

         The basis of another complaint is that, while it appears at this point that the legislation will be effective from the beginning of July 1994, in fact it is effective for some funds from 1 December 1993. I complimented the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is now at the table, on the brilliance of his blinding introductory speeches where he read the explanatory memorandums to these bills. I was not all that impressed by the explanations he offered for some of the difficult and technical passages where the community is wanting a bit of enlightenment.

Trustees will now have to confront the new legislation for superannuation insurance, the Commonwealth corporations law and the state or territory trustees law. They have three fronts where they need to exercise judicial judgment and very great care in the exercise of their management for which they are charged for these funds. A proposal at an earlier stage was that we have one process for these people to deal with, and that would be something under the new SIS legislation. That has been shipped to one side, and we have not just one form of Commonwealth legislation but two forms of Commonwealth legislation and one form of tax legislation.

         For the operators on the ground, the government has, in its brilliance, produced 2,000 changes to superannuation law as it affects the average person or may effect the average person over the period it has been in office. Two thousand changes—can honourable members believe it? Most of them are minor changes, but there are substantial major changes that affect the savings of Australians. They have planned or may have had in train for 15 or 20 years the process of retirement, but the government can come along and change the taxing process and the yield overnight, and has not hesitated to do so. I think that is immoral. I do not think this government understands anything but where it can dig for better and bigger pots of gold. If the government has dug for pots of gold, it has been amongst the retirees. If I may say so, the government has really wrecked their expectations of it, and their trust in it, with the way in which it has dealt with them. I think it is amazing and unconscionable the way in which the government has dealt with those people.

It employs a lot of semiskilled and unskilled people on a part-time and casual basis and allows people to keep house and home together. In this day and age of high unemployment, I will bet that everybody in the gallery knows of some breadwinner who has lost his or her job and has been replaced in the work force by his wife or her husband working on a part-time basis in order to keep the food coming in and to keep paying the bills. That is the area where people hurt and is the area that the Retailers Council drew attention to some time ago. In a speech made in Wollongong on 17 March 1992, St Patricks Day, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)—it is a pity he was not in Ireland because he would have been better off if he had not made this speech—stated:

In the same speech, the Treasurer stated:

        The superannuation guarantee will provide the basis for an increase in Australia's national savings.

        That is occurring but I believe not at a rate that will really supply the change in ethos that Australia needs. Let me deal with some of the specifics of the submission from the Retailers Council. The Retailers Council said to the Senate committee:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the level of income likely to be available on reaching retirement age is expected to be minimal.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is true. On three per cent or five per cent, there will not be much difference to the retirement ability of people to purchase or have more. Further, the Retailers Council said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . substantially increased administrative burden on retailers cannot be justified.
       </para>
       <para>
        Every employer that I have spoken to over the last two weeks in examining this matter says that the small benefit for the employee makes it a time consuming and wasteful process. The fund managers tell me the same thing. The third point the Retailers Council made was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a relatively large proportion of these employees' superannuation savings will be eroded by the administrative costs of the fund managers.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is right but, I contend, more than it would have predicted at that time. What did the Retailers Council say when interviewed about what it would do if the government brought in this scheme? The big retailers—David Jones, Grace Bros, Myers and all of the major retailers we know all around Australia—were amongst those surveyed. Five said they would meet the cost by increasing prices, nine said they would meet the cost of superannuation by decreasing hours available to their employees and 13 said they would decrease the actual number of employees; and that has happened. There are 60,000 people on the scrap heap. Sackings have been brought about by the cost of this charge with no benefit to the Australian employers, many of them small ones. It is the wrong time to do this and the wrong action to take.

         I want to deal quickly with some of the people who miss out. I take the example of an evening college in my district. Teacher No. 1 earned $450 in only one calendar month between 1 July 1992 and 30 June 1993 and became eligible for a three per cent superannuation payment calculated at three per cent of $450, which is $13.50. Most superannuation funds have an administrative charge of at least $52 per annum. What did this person find? He paid $13.50, but there was a bill of $52 standing against his name. If he goes back to work at the evening college that money will be sucked out again. Until he has paid the $52 off, he has a bill against his name. That will go on and on for part-time employees.

The payment was $113, less $52; so he made a profit. But in year two he had $61 brought forward from year one plus an administrative cost for the next year. People are losing out time and again.

         —I apologise for not being available in the chamber during the debate; it was simply not possible for me to be here. The real question here is whether the government has a superannuation policy that will drive more money into the system, that is, so that more money is available for retirement income than would otherwise have been the case. That is the sole test. The point is that we have now delivered a system that will do that. The funny thing is, though, that the engine that drives the entire system is the super guarantee charge.

         Prior to the last election those in the opposition said, `If we are elected, we will put a cap on the super guarantee charge and ensure that forever more people are putting in only three to five per cent, usually on behalf of the employee by the boss'. What a massive contradiction. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) says three to five per cent is not enough, and he has just quoted the submission of the Retailers Council of Australia to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. He said that the system was bound to fail because it would not produce the sorts of savings that he predicts will be necessary for those to retire comfortably. But those opposite wanted to put a cap on the amount of money that could be placed into funds on behalf of employees. They will have to wake up to the fact that they lost the last election.

         I have seen a recent statement by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), that if the coalition wins the election in 1996 it will have another cap, by which time about six per cent of a worker's earnings will be compulsorily put in on his or her behalf under the superannuation guarantee charge. I guess those opposite would have fouled the then relatively new system up had they won the election, but when we get around to the next election in 1996 this system will be mature and pouring very substantial amounts of money into the retirement income investment accounts of workers. That is what it is all about.

         The opposition could not design a system that could drive that number of dollars into private accounts that would be well handled and managed and that would produce decent retirement incomes. That is the test. Today there are so many more dollars flowing into those accounts on behalf of workers which they will be able to draw on for their retirement. What a contradiction it is that those opposite suggest that three per cent or five per cent is insufficient, yet they are the ones who would have kept it at three to five per cent. That is the point. There is no doubt that we have a unique system. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.

        This bill is part of a package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, which was passed by this House on 6 September. That bill contained the government's key budget taxation measures. As part of its campaign to obstruct the passage of the government's 1993-94 budget, the opposition referred the deficit reduction bill to a Senate committee. The committee was asked to determine whether, by combining measures dealing with several subjects of taxation, the bill contravened section 55 of the constitution.

         Parliament has been passing taxation bills combining several subjects of taxation since at least 1984. Only now has this been raised as an issue. The government's senior legal advisers, and parliamentary counsel, gave advice to the committee that the deficit reduction bill was clearly valid and that none of its measures imposed taxation. The Senate committee concluded, correctly, that only the High Court can determine issues of constitutional validity.

         The committee also concluded that there was a risk that the bill would be declared invalid. This conclusion was contrary to the advice of the government's chief general counsel and of other experts who presented their views to the committee. The government does not accept the committee's conclusion. Moreover, the committee gave no reasons for its conclusions and gave the government no guidance as to how to split the bill.

         Views put to the committee that the bill is invalid fall into two categories. The first is that any increase in the formal rate of a tax is an imposition of tax. This view draws an illogical distinction between a rate increase and an enlargement of a tax base. The second is that any increase in liability to taxation is an imposition of tax. If this argument is accepted, then most of the tax laws passed over the past 50 years are also invalid. This is an absurd argument.

         The government is entitled to rely on the clear and unequivocal advice of its legal advisers. Nevertheless, the opposition's actions on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill have created considerable uncertainty. The government has decided to remove that uncertainty and withdraw the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and to reintroduce the budget measures in a package of related bills.

         Apart from the measures included in the `test case' bill, the repackaged bills would not be challenged by those who argue that the only amendments in the package which impose tax are those which increase a rate of tax. The government has deliberately rejected the extreme view that any increase in the incidence of a tax is an imposition of tax. It has, therefore, refrained from structuring these bills to avoid a challenge from this quarter. If that view is correct, then virtually all of the Commonwealth's tax laws are invalid. It would be pointless to address those concerns without rewriting the corpus of all the existing tax laws.

         The bills comprised in this package are the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bills (Nos. 1 to 3) 1993 and five sales tax bills. Each of the bills has been marked with a `T' to signify that they are not bills which impose taxation. The government also believes that the constitutional issues must be resolved once and for all, so that the parliament can focus on the substance, and not the form, of government initiatives. To allow the issue to be settled quickly, and without affecting the integrity of the budget package, one of the bills, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993, has been drafted as a test bill to facilitate a High Court challenge. This has been done by combining two minor rate increases involving different subjects of taxation. These measures do not affect revenue until after 1 July 1994.

        This bill has been deliberately designed to facilitate a challenge in the High Court on the constitutional issues raised before the Senate committee that considered the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill.

        This bill is the third in the package of bills which replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. It incorporates changes to the timing of the first stage of the tax cuts announced and legislated for in 1992, the deferral of the second round of those tax cuts, and the introduction of a low income rebate. I turn now to a more detailed explanation of the provisions.

         The amendments contained in the bill will change the timing for the commencement of the two stage reduction in the tax rates announced in One Nation on 26 February 1992. The first stage will now commence on 15 November 1993, 7 1/2 months earlier than scheduled. The bill provides that the second stage of tax cuts will commence at the beginning of a financial year to be fixed by regulation. Because the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 15 November 1993, the bill contains the new composite rate scales to apply for 1993-94 and the first stage rates for the 1994-95 and later income years.

         The new rates to apply from 15 November 1993 will benefit taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $20,700. The tax cuts will cost the revenue $1.55 billion this financial year.

        This bill is the fourth in the package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-94 budget. The government does not accept that any of the bills in this package imposes tax. Nevertheless, it has structured the sales tax bills so as to put the matter beyond challenge by those who would argue that an increase in a formal rate of tax is an imposition of tax.

         For constitutional reasons, sales tax is imposed by four acts. Those acts impose sales tax to the extent that it is: a duty of customs; a duty of excise; a tax on in situ swimming pools; a tax that is none of the above. This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (Customs) Act 1992.

         I now turn to the three sales tax changes covered by this bill, and the other sales tax bills in this package. The first change will increase all sales tax rates by one percentage point, with effect from 18 August 1993. This is expected to raise $435 million this year and $585 million in 1994-95. A further one percentage point increase for all sales tax rates will come into effect on 1 July 1995.

         The second change will increase the rates of sales tax on wine, also with effect from 18 August. Compared with beer and spirits, wine is lightly taxed. While it is presently subject to sales tax, it does not carry any excise. It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on wine with an alcoholic content of greater than 1.15 per cent from 20 per cent to 31 per cent.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The rate of tax on low-alcohol wine, that is, wine with an alcoholic content of 1.15 per cent or less, is to increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. Some low-alcohol wine is currently taxable at 20 per cent and its rate of tax will increase to 21 per cent in line with the proposed increase for all sales tax rates. The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $70 million in 1993-94, $95 million in 1994-95, $105 million in 1995-96 and $110 million in 1996-97.

         The last sales tax change will vary the rate of tax applicable to luxury motor vehicles, also with effect from 18 August 1993. Luxury vehicles are currently taxable at 30 per cent on their entire wholesale value. The current sales tax treatment results in a substantial pricing distortion: the addition of $1 to the wholesale price of a passenger motor vehicle now priced at the threshold would increase the sales tax liability by $4,873.

         It is proposed to remove this distortion by applying a split rate of sales tax to luxury motor vehicles. Broadly, the ordinary rates of sales tax applicable to motor vehicles will apply up to the wholesale luxury threshold. A rate of 45 per cent will apply to that portion of the wholesale value over the luxury threshold. The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $5 million in 1993-94 and $10 million in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97.

          —I am going to close the remarks I started prior to dinner to end the second reading debate on these superannuation bills. I was making the point that there was a massive contradiction in the opposition's stance on superannuation to the extent that it was complaining that the level the superannuation guarantee charge had reached—which was between only three and five per cent of a worker's earnings—was insufficient to generate funds for income in retirement. That is quite correct, but that is not our policy. Our policy is that that level of charge should rise to nine per cent early next century, and perhaps beyond that. At that point, there would be sufficient funds put away so that workers might enjoy an income in retirement above and beyond what they would expect from today's pension.

          The massive contradiction of the opposition's argument is that had it been elected, it would have capped the SGC. That is what it said at the last election. Its new position is that it would like to cap the SGC if it is elected in 1996, at which time the SGC will be around six per cent. So I simply do not understand what its proposition is. I assume that it is arguing that should it be elected, it will put a cap on the thing that drives this whole system—the superannuation guarantee charge, which is compulsorily driving money into superannuation and which is the essence of the whole system.

          Should the opposition cap it, it then has to devise another means by which money will be put into these funds. The traditional method is that we give some form of tax rebate so that the employee or the employer feels as though it is worth putting money into superannuation because of that tax rebate. What happens, though, is that a taxpayer has to spend money in order to create money, in order to get money to put into superannuation. So we ask the question: how much is it going to cost to induce money into superannuation under the opposition's policy?  We do not know the answer; we just know it will be a heck of a lot. What is the use of spending a great deal of money if we probably do not lift the level of savings of the nation by way of superannuation funds?

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          There is another problem with the alternative view: what sort of coverage do we get? There are a lot of people who will accept no inducement to save under a superannuation scheme and, therefore, will never be covered under superannuation. We have been going through that debate for 10 years. The government and the superannuation industry have decided, and well know, that we really need an element of compulsion here to drive the funds into superannuation. That is our stance. We won the last election. The SGC will be driven up to at least nine per cent early next century, which we think will be a sufficient amount to be put away on behalf of the workers.

          I want to return to other elements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill. The essence of the bill is that we acknowledge that although money is being compulsorily driven into the system, it will be managed in private hands by private fund managers or by any other means, but essentially by private individuals. We could not have a system of regulation that did not put a very clear fence and guidelines around how private moneys are to be handled. So we have ensured that the central figure is a trustee, the person entrusted to make sure that superannuation funds in whatever sort of scheme are well managed and that the improvement of those funds is returned in time to the workers who invested in the funds.

          A point was made during the debate that the fear was that the trustees would be beholden to, I think, two or three sets of legislation under federal government acts. That simply is not true. In the SI(S) Bill, what we have done is simply to transcribe trust law—already existing trust law that will govern the behaviour of these people—codify it and write it down. This is perhaps the first time an effort has been made to make nice and clear the way in which we expect these people to act—the meaning of acting properly, carefully and prudently. They should make investment plans explicit, open and overt, and tell members of the funds how they are investing the money. We figure that the more people see how funds are being invested, the safer is the package of funds.

          But we do not suggest, as the opposition did in its contribution to the debate, how the funds are to be invested. We do not tell funds what are good or what are bad investments. We seek that they should be prudent in their investment, but we do not tell them how to invest. What we are asking them to do in this bill is to set out an investment strategy and then make clear to their members what the investment strategy is. If they do not get a rate of return that is satisfactory to members, then members will know that the government cannot cover them for unsatisfactory returns; that will be a matter for intelligent decision making by private fund managers and investors.

          However, if there is any fraud or theft by the management or trustee of funds, the government can step in and impose a levy so as to cover the moneys lost by fraud or theft. But, at the end of the day, we could not possibly guarantee those funds which sit in private superannuation schemes. That is not our intent. But we will certainly have a regime of rules and regulations that try as far as possible to ensure that sensible, prudent people make good investment decisions on behalf of the many millions of Australian workers who are putting their money into these funds for retirement purposes.

         We do not prescribe how people will be chosen to be member representatives on the board of trustees, and it is better that we do not. It would be quite impractical if we were to prescribe too closely. In some cases the employer representative or the employee representative will be a trade union member; in other cases they will not. But, in a way, that whole debate is many years out of date. What is happening today in the management of, say, big industry funds is that the bosses' representatives and the workers' representatives are jointly elected to manage the funds. We are not in a state where we are at war with each other. Both sides of the fence are agreeing to manage the funds of the workers.

          I met with members of the Queensland Confederation of Industry late last week. They were telling me about the Sun superannuation fund, which covers several hundred thousand workers in Queensland. I think it is the third or the fifth largest such industry fund in Australia. The people who happily sit on the board of that fund, who happily cohabit, are the three principals of the Queensland Confederation of Industry—I think it is the president, the chief executive officer and the vice-president. The employee representatives are the secretary of the Queensland branch of the ACTU, the secretary of the AWU, which is the largest union in Queensland, and the secretary of the metal workers union, which is probably the second largest union in Queensland.

          Far from there being any sort of suspicion about having union nominated representatives on boards of trustees, in practice—throughout Australia, not just in Queensland—we have representatives from both sides happily sitting down together to manage the funds that are in private hands and which will eventually flow to workers for their retirement. The language of the opposition on this point is years out of date. The reason why the language is out of date is that the criticisms are out of date. It is old hat. We solved this one a long time ago.

          A number of honourable members—again, on the opposite side—raised questions about clause 62. Clause 62 is the means by which the government says to any person owning a business that it does not want that person to invest the assets of his or her business or other such assets in the superannuation fund. The government wants any moneys to be invested in the fund to be for genuine retirement purposes; not for the purpose of picking up a nice little tax gain on the way through, or a means of propping up the business. The government wants people to separate the interests of their business from the interests of the superannuation fund.

          Superannuation funds are for retirement income generating purposes alone. The Occupational Superannuation Standards Act has been in place for some years and it specifies a sole purpose test: namely, that any moneys or assets placed into a fund must have the sole purpose of generating an income on retirement.

          However, we have found that the sole purpose test has been so variously interpreted by the courts that it does not always work. It has not been as tight as the government would have wished, so we have written a new clause—clause 62—into this new act to make it absolutely explicit that in all circumstances, whatever fancy devise might be thought up, a contribution to a super fund can only be delivered in cash. In other words, no business person in Australia can be under any doubt as to the intention of clause 62, which is to separate business interests from superannuation fund—

          We would have happily stayed with a pension system, as we have known it in this country since about 1909, I suppose, but for the fact, as we have heard a thousand times over, that with the number of people moving into retirement over the next 20 or 30 years it is too much to ask of future taxpayers to fund the future pensioners. We have really had to bring the system forward so that each of us will have to contribute now to our own retirement. That is the argument, and everyone in Australia knows it, except for the opposition.

          Once that argument is accepted, we then have to ensure that the primary purpose of pension funds is maintained so that they are not used for any purpose other than to generate retirement income. From the government's point of view then, clause 62 is unremarkable and should not be amended.

          I have already argued the question of the voluntary versus compulsory nature of contributions. We favour a compulsory contribution scheme because the money will not flow otherwise. But we are certainly keen to encourage people who, in addition to the compulsory contribution, wish to make their own personal contributions in order to build up their fund in retirement.

          There was some debate about what the opposition alleges to be the disproportionate costs to small funds by the introduction of this legislation, and the various ways in which we seek to administer and supervise the funds. The fifth report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation clearly showed that the current costs of regulating small funds, from the government's perspective, is not borne by those small funds. In other words, there is an implicit subsidy to small funds at present—not the reverse, as the opposition has suggested. Further, there is no evidence to suggest that small fund members are particularly poor or low income earners. In fact, it is highly likely that members in small funds are the better off members of the community. There is general agreement that prudential supervision of superannuation needs strengthening.

         Because it might facilitate the movement of these superannuation bills through committee, I take this opportunity to discuss this clause and probably subsequent clauses to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill. It is up to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) whether I am allowed to do that, but it might help circumvent proceedings somewhat.

         In his second reading defence, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer was quite unique in his attributions to the coalition. He referred to capping the SGCs and he came to the conclusion that somehow, by some tortuous logic, coalition policy three years hence would have some dire consequences for superannuants and potential beneficiaries covered by these funds as a result of something that we might propose to do. It was a case of the parliamentary secretary building up a straw man and knocking him down, because we said nothing in our policy prior to the previous election or during this debate which could lead him to reasonably arrive at such a conclusion.

         So the parliamentary secretary was immediately on the defensive. The parliamentary secretary read out my second reading amendment, but he forgot the opening words which were, in effect, for all seven bills, that while not denying the bills a second reading—and therefore in the jargon of this place indicating that we were not going to oppose the measures—somehow we were out to unreasonably criticise the government and decisions it has taken in arriving at the situation that is reflected in these bills.

         The amendment points out that it is possible, and likely, that trade union representatives—or nominees of trade unions—will become the representatives of all employees on the boards of trustees of the relevant funds. The parliamentary secretary went on to claim that there was some merit in that although it was not obligatory. The effect of the government proposition will be that if a trade union nominates a person to be the employee representative on a trust he will be appointed. Failing that—if it should ever happen—perhaps some other employee, not the nominee of the trade union, may gain the ascendancy. But that will not be the rule; that will be the exception. One could bet one's life that the trade unions will not let that go by default.

         The parliamentary secretary complained that the opposition was not wedded to compulsion. We certainly are not. There are other ways of going about getting people to provide for their own retirement, and we are unashamedly of that mind. It is only a Labor government that believes in compulsion. It believes in the big stick, not the carrot. But the parliamentary secretary seemed to justify that particular attraction to compulsion by the fact that the government won the last election. That is strange logic, but I guess it is not entirely unexpected. I do not remember superannuation looming large during the last election. I do remember one of the main issues being income tax cuts and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying that they are enshrined in l-a-w, law, whereas in fact we know that it came to mean l-a-w, lie and win. That was an issue in the last election, but there was nothing about superannuation. It is nonsense to imply by this strange twist of the imagination that the government somehow has a mandate to do what it proposes to do tonight.

         The truth is that the opposition is not opposed to the legislation, given Labor's obsession to making compulsory superannuation the vehicle for retirement incomes when Australians get to that ripe old age where they must rely on the fruits of their labour. We think there are better ways of doing it. Through the parliamentary secretary, the government justifies codifying the law. Perhaps it is not important, but what the parliamentary secretary omitted to point out is that there is law there now, except that in many cases it is common law. He proposes to substitute statutory law.

         The precedents that go to make up the common law as it is presently understood and observed are there for all time. In a way, I am glad that the parliamentary secretary says he is not wedded to the common law. He might apply that principle when it comes to Mabo, and he will not enter the defence that the decision of the High Court is somehow sacrosanct because it is common law. We all know that common law is not sacrosanct and that this parliament can legislate to replace common law with statute law. That is a very fine argument, and I hope that the parliamentary secretary is around when the Mabo debate comes on because he will not be relying on the fact that the High Court's decision in that case is common law.

         The parliamentary secretary went on to talk about how the funds will not be told how to invest their accumulated takings from potential retirees and superannuants. Perhaps that is correct, but again he omitted a very important factor that the funds must have a written investment strategy and that that investment strategy will be approved by the appropriate authority and form part of the trust deed. It is a covenant attached to the trust deed.

         In one context, the parliamentary secretary said in his second reading defence, `We have solved these problems long ago'. In effect, they were the words he used. If he has solved all the problems in relation to superannuation, there will be no further legislation during the life of this parliament—and pigs might fly! If he solved all the problems a long time ago, why does the government need seven amendments to legislation which was first brought into this parliament in September last year and only lapsed because of the proroguing of the parliament? If the government solved all these problems a long time ago, why does it need to introduce two further amendments and sundry mechanical amendments to the legislation? The government did not solve anything a long time ago, and it is a long way short of solving it right now.

        A fundamental principle of this legislation is that a superannuation fund should be in the control of a single party, the trustees, who take full responsibilities for the fund. The public offer funds, which apparently are presently subject to the Corporations Law, have been required to have responsibility split between two parties, a management company which effectively runs the fund and a trustee company which has much more of a background role acting as a supervisor or a custodian.

         The government does not propose to impose a mandatory change from the existing two-party structure for these funds. However, these funds should be encouraged to change to a one-party structure, and the legislation facilitates such a change. In order to encourage these funds to change, they will not be able to accept new business while they retain the existing two-party structure, although they will be able to carry on accepting contributions from existing members and to accept new members who are employees of existing employer sponsors.

         If either the trustee company or the management company ceases to hold office for any reason, such as a vote of members under the existing trustee provisions, then the remaining party will take over the functions of both trustee and management company.

         Appropriate notices will have to be given to all members at least one month before the change occurs. An important feature of these amendments is that they allow a grandfathering of existing arrangements, subject to not being able to accept new business, where the members, the trustee company and the management company, all wish to continue. While the arrangement is grandfathered, it will be subject to the provisions of SIS applied appropriately to one or both of the trustee company and the management company.

         In addition, it will be subject to a number of provisions closely reflecting the existing provisions of the Corporations Law, particularly those dealing with the relationship between the trustee company and the management company. Clause 62, `Acquisition of assets from members', prohibits trustees from purchasing assets from members or from accepting in specie contributions from members. A prohibition on such actions has been incorporated in the occupational superannuation standards regulations, with effect from 30 June 1993. The government indicated an intention to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act to allow retrospective regulations to be made to prohibit the acquisition of assets from 27 May 1993. After further consideration the government has decided that it is not necessary to proceed with such an amendment.

         —The mechanisms by which the committee requires the legislation to be dealt with highlighted an important point and reinforced that which I made a little while ago—that is, that it is strange indeed that the government needs the number of amendments we now have to consider when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) has claimed that his government solved problems in relation to superannuation, to use his words, `a long time ago'.

         For this bill alone, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill 1993, we have 92 amendments. That is just for the first of seven bills. That sits passing strange with the parliamentary secretary's claim that everything has been under control for a long time. It is more than curious that he would say that in the certain knowledge that, despite the 20 or 30 bills regulating or in some way affecting superannuation in the life of successive Labor governments since 1983, the government has not been able to get it right. It seems very optimistic indeed to think that we will not have more legislation in the very near future, and indeed an examination of the legislation would bear that out. The government still has not resolved important issues. So who listening could possibly believe that the government has solved problems associated with superannuation a long time ago, as the parliamentary secretary just spuriously claimed?

         In his response to the second reading debate, the parliamentary secretary showed that he did not listen and that obviously he was relying on second- or third-hand advice, and it seems that at least some of that was not accurate. In those circumstances, if he is charged with the conduct of the legislation through the chamber and cannot be in attendance, I would simply say, in the spirit of cooperation, that he should not presume to tell the chamber what was said during the second reading debate—and it should be made clear in these committee proceedings.

         One thing he has said that I want to take issue with is that the government intends to encourage to take out extra cover those people who obviously, through their employer, do not have sufficient funds invested in a fund to cover their total needs in retirement. Apart from the narrow category of self-employed people, he did not go on to say how such people would be encouraged. He has not examined, in public anyway and certainly not in committee, the possibility that sooner or later employees must also make a contribution out of their earnings to get the present up to six per cent compulsory levy topped up to something like that which is necessary to provide adequate retirement income. It is commonly believed that one needs something like 12 per cent to 14 per cent of one's income invested in a superannuation fund to be able to accrue a reasonable retirement income—and that is over a period of 40 years.

         The six per cent compulsory levy, which Labor is wedded to, as anyone can see goes only a short way towards the total need. We know that the government contemplates increasing the compulsory level—but who knows to what—thereby increasing the cost of employment, but it has not tackled, publicly anyway, the possibility that workers might have to contribute something out of their after tax income, as do most people contributing to funds which existed prior to and outside those catering for the six per cent levy.

         The matter is left up in the air. The parliamentary secretary, in a throwaway line, says that he will encourage people to take out extra cover to meet their total requirements. But he does not say how; he does not embellish—nor, from what we can gather, does he or his government have any idea how to go about it. Will they resort to the personal urging of our spaced-out Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)? Will they rely on the persuasiveness of our stressed-out Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? Who is going to believe those guys? How will they tackle the problem seriously?

         We would have welcomed some indication on that, particularly if we need 92 amendments to this bill alone. The legislation was brought into the House before parliament was prorogued last year. Two major amendments were made only a couple of weeks ago. We would have thought they would give us some indication as to how they would deal with the total picture. But there is no such indication or undertaking by those in government of how, in a reasonable way and hopefully without increasing the total cost of employment—which already exceeds that which enables us to be competitive with those against whom we trade—they will come to grips with the problem of getting the total contributions, employer or employee, up to the necessary level.

         We do not accept the personal assurances of the parliamentary secretary or the government that they will encourage potential superannuants to take out extra cover. That is simply not good enough, given the record of this government with its litany of lies during the last election campaign. The coalition will not cop that. I do not think the Australian people will either—but we will see.

         I am disappointed that if we need 92 clauses to amend legislation introduced as recently as a couple of weeks ago, following legislation which was introduced towards the end of the last parliament, the government could not have addressed serious issues. Certainly, members of the government should not be claiming, as the parliamentary secretary did in his defence of the second reading, that they sorted things out a long time ago in connection with superannuation. They would not need all these amendments if they had. Each of the seven bills is to be amended comprehensively; although we are discussing only the first one.

         The full effect of those amendments, particularly the 92 to the bill under discussion, will be examined very closely by my colleague Senator Watson and the Senate committee which he chairs. We have been favoured with this information for relatively few hours. There is no way of knowing whether the parliamentary secretary's justifications for the amendments are accurate. Given some of the things he said earlier, we might reasonably have doubts. But even if we have no reason for doubt, we are in no position to say with any certainty that these amendments are acceptable. We say however that they are the proper subject of examination by Senator Watson's committee.

        I draw particular attention to the provisions of clause 14 which go to the question of trustees. The reason we have amended this clause is that a trustee is protected from the possibility of having to pay a benefit twice if the payment of a benefit is withheld until the question of who should receive it is resolved. The new clause, particularly subclauses 3 and 4, will remove the potential problem of a trustee withholding payment of a benefit indefinitely while waiting to see whether a potential beneficiary will lodge a complaint with the tribunal.

         It is also important that a potential complainant is aware of the time frame within which he or she should refer the matter to the complaints tribunal. The amendments to subclause 14.1 make it clear that the tribunal is able to consider complaints relating to a trustee's decision made before the commencement of the act. Subclause 14.5 provides that regulations may be made which preclude the tribunal from dealing with an aspect of a complaint. Amendments to this subclause are included to give greater flexibility to matters that should not be examined by the tribunal. For example, the wording would permit a regulation to be made to exclude only the actual interpretation of medical evidence from the review of the tribunal while allowing all other aspects of a payment on the grounds of disability to be considered. The note at the bottom of clause 14 was amended to include a reference to the definition of excluded subject matter in clause 3.2.

        I draw attention to a number of points here. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966 in respect of the treatment of superannuation benefits for persons who have become bankrupt. The major changes are to exclude from the divisible property of a bankrupt proceeds of policies of life assurance or endowment assurance on the life of a bankrupt or the bankrupt's spouse and the interest of the bankrupt in, or payments received from, a regulated superannuation fund or approved deposit fund. The exceptions to this are where the total value of the bankrupt's property that relates to superannuation benefits and life assurance policies exceeds $800,000. Any amount in excess of $800,000 is available for creditors. The figure of $800,000 equates to the pension reasonable benefit limit and is to be indexed annually.

         A provision is to be inserted in the Bankruptcy Act that will void any provision in governing rules that has the effect of cancelling, forfeiting, reducing or qualifying the beneficial interest of a member of a superannuation fund or approved deposit fund where the member becomes bankrupt, commits an act of bankruptcy, or executes a deed of assignment or deed of arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act. This provision will apply to all governing rules, including those made before this legislation is passed.

         In talking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I intend to move sideways in time to a land that might have been. I think everyone recognises that the deficit is a crushing problem for Australia. There are reasons for the growth in the deficit—declining commodity prices being the most obvious and the growth in imports being the most insidious.

         It seems self-evident that no matter what a government does or says it cannot come to grips with this problem by taxation. It simply cannot tax people enough; it cannot raise enough revenue through taxation to address the deficit, nor can it cut government expenditure enough to do this. We need a multipronged attack, and that requires the implementation of intelligent industry policy. It is to that I wish to address myself tonight.

         What is an industry policy? An industry policy is, in my view, a policy which best facilitates the operation of industry in Australia. In looking at industries, I think we have to ask ourselves what sorts of industries Australia has or should have. Clearly, there are two sorts. There are industries where we have a natural advantage, such as mining and wool—Australia's great and unique product, where we should be encouraging all forms of downstream processing and value adding. There are, of course, many others. The other sort are strategic industries, industries that Australia would need if the rest of the world were to catch fire; industries where we should have a level of competence that would see us self-sufficient. Those industries may need nurturing in the early days, and I do not resile from the need for tariffs to achieve this.

         It is very common to hear people say today that we cannot pick winners. The truth is that every successful country in the world has picked winners. Japan has had a startlingly good record at this. We are told by the economic boffins that Japan has simply worked harder than we have. This is, of course, arrant nonsense. The Japanese did pick winners; however, they did a lot more than this. It was not just a matter of picking winners. Japan's whole economy was geared to supporting growing industries, so for many years it had very strong controls on capital outflow. There was nowhere overseas that the Japanese could send their money. After the war, had that facility been there, Japanese capital would have fled Japan to countries that looked more prosperous and looked as though they had more potential.

         Japan also had a ban on capital inflow. The Japanese did not want foreign money coming in and picking up their industries which were, in those days, virtually on their knees. It wanted to retain control—a very important facet.

          The Japanese also required joint venturers to bring any capital into the country with them. They did not allow them to come into the country and then raise the capital on their capital markets. These are initiatives which I believe Australia should adopt, and adopt quickly. None of them would contravene GATT and all would be beneficial to the establishment of industry in this country because it would make available that pool of capital funds.

         We have spoken tonight about superannuation. That is another source of capital funds. It seems to me that the problem with superannuation is that the responsibility of banks is clearly to bank shareholders, not to the nation. Superannuation funds run by banks will be designed to maximise returns to their shareholders and, of necessity, will be short term. The responsibility of superannuation funds is to their members, not to the nation, and their performance will be exactly the same: they will operate to maximise the benefits to those to whom they are responsible.

         The better model I think is probably the British pension fund which has been operating very successfully for many years. This fund collects pensions through the taxation system and puts in a safety net for people to make provision for themselves beyond that. I believe that system should have been given much more consideration rather than the enormous free kick we have given to the superannuation funds.

         Last month in Melbourne a seminar was held at which people discussed the automotive industry. It was said that by the year 2000 motor cars would contain between five and seven kilograms of magnesium. Magnesium is very difficult to cast; it tends to combust in the presence of air, so it has to be cast in inert gases. This seminar was attended by the very large companies of Australia—Toyota, Ford and General Motors—and it was their view that this technology is far too difficult for Australia and would have to be done overseas because the 15 per cent tariff would not be enough to warrant embarking upon this very risky technology. It calls into play the future of the Australian car industry. It is an industry which is now totally foreign controlled.

He had gravity die-cast them in 1938, a process which he was told was impossible. Having heard these captains of industry, he got up and said, `This is what I produced in 1938. If you want to do it, if you have the will to do it, there is a way'. I think there is a very clear message for Australia there.

         For too long we have relied heavily on overseas people. It is what I call a cargo cult, the latest manifestation being the Olympic games. Once again we have the view that somebody from overseas will come over here and save us by giving us the Olympic games. It is true that the Los Angeles games made a profit, but Barcelona is now in the grip of recession following the Olympic games and the debt with which it was left. The reality is that the games will be inherently more profitable in the United States because there is a larger population. It happens to be in the time zone of the greatest population, and television will pay prime rates for the coverage which it simply will not pay for in out-of-kilter time zones.

         The industry policy is the way forward. No matter what any politician, or anyone else for that matter, says, unless we re-establish a manufacturing industry in Australia to replace imports there will be no jobs; there will simply not be enough jobs for our children. Population growth alone in Australia requires 100,000 jobs a year just to keep even, and on top of that there is the impact of immigration. To maintain immigration in the face of this situation, in my view, is reprehensible. It occurs because governments not only do not listen to the will of the people but also actively conspire to confound it.

         I suggest that in Australia we should look to shale oil. In Queensland we have shale oil resources in great excess, far greater than our proven oil resources. Shale oil is economically viable at about $23 a barrel, and it is viable because of Australian technology—the investment we have made in that technology and the success the companies involved have had in developing a continuous process rather than the Bass process that preceded it. Were we to convert our demand for oil into shale oil, there would be a massive increase in employment. It is much more labour intensive than the existing method of getting our oil. There would be an enormous boost to engineering as we constructed the plants necessary to produce that oil. When we were self-sufficient in shale oil we would have a very large resource of a highly exportable commodity.

         The second outcome is that it hurts the poor more than the rich. This is from a Labor government—the working man's party. It started off with an extra $2 a week for low income earners. What a big deal that was! It has now increased it to $3 a week—about $150 a year. That is still less than the costs will go up for low income earners because the hidden tax rises are there in everything they buy.

         I would like to refer briefly to a paper put out by Dr Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales which shows the results for a number of income areas in the 1994 budget mark 2 at that stage, and all prices and values for 1992-93. The first example is of a family of two adults with children—one adult working—and a household income of $27,000. With no allowance for bracket creep, that family will be $2.74 a week worse off under this Labor budget. With allowance for bracket creep up to 1996-97, that family will be $12.15 a week worse off. This is supposedly a Labor government, a government for the workers.

This is supposed to be a government to look after the low income people. With bracket creep, the family with an income of $60,000 will be $13.08 a week worse off by 1996-97.

         I did say that there are three outcomes, but actually there is a fourth. I call this one the Clinton gift. The Labor government has reduced company taxation to 33 per cent. It thinks that will help business employ people. The government does not understand the basic point: to help businesses they have got to be made more profitable, their costs have to be lowered and taxation must not be increased. This is what the government has done—it has increased taxation on their inputs. It is no big deal to reduce income tax for companies because first they have to make a profit.

On 30 June 1991, investment in Australia by United States entities was $A54.237 billion. In 1990-91 the investment income on that was $A3.866 billion. It is rather interesting that with a 33 per cent tax rate, that will amount to taxation of $A1.276 billion. One might say that is fine, but just think of one thing: American corporate taxation law says that where American corporations overseas pay less tax than they would pay at home, they make up the difference at home. The tax rate is basically 36 per cent. That means that American corporations in Australia will be paying $A1.276 billion here, but at 36 per cent, which is their home rate, it will be $A1.392 billion. The difference is $A116 million.

         The upshot of this budget that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have introduced is that Bill Clinton and the American government, the American taxpayer, will be the beneficiaries of a $116 million windfall because of our corporate taxation rate.

        That is a statement of fact. That is a statement of truth. What a mistake the fuel tax was. Originally it was going to be 5c a litre for diesel fuel and 5c a litre for unleaded fuel by August 1994. Of course, for leaded fuel, the increase was going to be 10c a litre by February 1995. The government has reduced the leaded fuel increase, but that is the only change it has made. People should not be misled into thinking the government has taken away the increases in fuel excise. The only change is to reduce the increase in the price of unleaded fuel from 10c to 7c a litre.

This week I will be presenting petitions to this House bearing 5,150 signatures from people in my electorate who are concerned about the future of credit unions. The decision by the Treasurer to remove the longstanding tax exemption on credit unions under section 23G ignores the unique role that they play in our retail finance sector. Credit unions are owned and funded completely by their members. Any income earned by the credit union apart from that required to meet expenses and prudent reserves is returned to members in the form of better rates of interest on savings and loans and is used to fund new products and services.

         A tax on credit unions is a tax on volunteers. Many credit unions rely on the work of volunteers to provide basic services to their members. All credit unions rely on volunteer directors elected by the membership to manage their affairs. Those volunteers are appalled that the government would tax hard won gains achieved through cooperative unpaid effort. A tax on credit unions is a tax on self-help. Credit union members work together to achieve a better life for themselves and their community. Credit unions play an important role in educating the public on credit and assisting many disadvantaged groups in Australia and overseas.

None of them issues permanent share capital; none of them distributes profits by way of dividends. No individual or corporation has or could have a controlling interest in any credit union.

         No credit union is permitted to transact business with non-members and each credit union member is entitled to one vote at general meetings, regardless of the size of his or her deposits or loans. While credit unions do not exist solely to serve low income earners and welfare recipients, the record on their commitment to social justice is unmatched by building societies, banks or any other financial institution.

         As the New South Wales Commercial Tribunal found in its 1992 inquiry, credit unions are the only financial institutions prepared to advance low value—that is, under $3,000—term loans. Credit unions promote the use of debit cards, with which members have access to their own savings, rather than credit cards which facilitate debt creation and over-commitment. Credit unions encourage volunteer involvement and currently have over 3,000 volunteer directors and more than 5,000 volunteer workplace representatives. It is totally unjust to tax credit union surpluses at the corporate rate as it will reduce their capital growth by one-third. This will, in turn, substantially limit their asset growth potential. The restriction so imposed on credit union growth could be enormous considering that, within the prudential standards as prescribed, credit unions make greater assets to the extent of approximately $15 for every $1 in reserves.

         There is much more that I could say about the impact on credit unions. I do not have time to tell the House all about it but, under the present tax regime, credit unions are encouraged to take a comparatively lax or generous approach to writing off loans in arrears. This is simply because there is no incentive to write off delinquent loans in order to claim a tax deduction. As a consequence, the present tax regime assists credit unions in helping their delinquent members through periods of personal and financial difficulty—and, boy, there are plenty of people in personal and financial difficulty right now. The ultimate beneficiaries are credit union members whose circumstances in many cases can be, and are, accommodated by credit unions without recourse to the indignity of default, loss of goods and a scar on their credit reference reports.

         If credit unions lose their tax status, they will then be under much greater pressure to get tough with members whose payments are in arrears. They will not want to move in this direction. It is not the credit union cooperative way to bankrupt their members and sequester their assets, but the tax regime will exert substantial pressure on credit unions to write off delinquent loans in order to increase their allowable deductions, reduce their tax liability and so ultimately retain their only source of capital growth. The ultimate losers will be the ordinary Australians who constitute credit union membership. They have traditionally been able to look to their credit unions for a fair deal, and those credit unions are not getting a fair deal from this government.

         —The budget represents an understandable package if one accepts the premises of rigid adherence to the diktat for a 1996-97 deficit of one per cent of GDP, the need for inequitable tax concessions seemingly more sacred than other commitments, and a marked unwillingness to increase direct taxation. It is to be hoped that the pursuit of the 1996-97 target is sensibly modified if projections fail to materialise, and we are confronted with alternative demands for stringent cuts to the social wage for poorer people.

         It is worth while recalling the government's late 1992 reassurances that Australia was `better placed than most other countries to provide fiscal stimulus'. Then we were reminded that the 1992 US deficit was five per cent of GDP and a record $290.2 billion. During 1992-93, Japan has announced three spending injections, the latest being $38 billion to kick-start the economy. Then and now, governments around the world recognise that fixation with targets like this accomplish little and limit options. Just how specious these targets can be is displayed by the current Canadian political contest, where the Progressive Conservatives are promising a zero level in five years, and the opposition Liberals three per cent at some time. In the UK, the deficit is currently eight per cent of GDP and the full recovery estimate is as high as three to four per cent.

         These targets might temporarily reassure a ravenous money market but their mindless pursuit can engender tremendous suffering and persistent failure to tackle infrastructure deficiencies or deliver some employment growth. Similarly, the recourse to indirect taxes, which is often politically easier, fails to drive home Australia's broader low tax status. It does not matter which set you use, or how they are calculated and contrived. The reality is there.

         Here, there has been strong recourse to wider indirect taxes to assist questionable income tax largesse to sometimes wealthier sections and to grind onwards with a fixation about the 1996 budget deficit. Thus, we had a projected 10.5 per cent increase in the sales tax take and a 15.4 per cent augmentation in petrol excise. The flat one per cent wholesales sales tax moves now and in July 1995 have pronounced regressive aspects. While not absolute, the general reality is the proportionate rises of 10 to 12 per cent, and 15 to 17 per cent on smaller items as opposed to products attracting the increases from 20 and 30 per cent, will heavily affect the purchasing power of poorer, including unemployed, citizens.

         It is partially reassuring that electorates such as mine are still immune from the impact upon significant food and clothing. After all, the Australian electorate was scared witless by far more extreme variations recently. However, in the context of more meagre income tax relief for poorer people than for those in high tax brackets, this is a telling decision. The increase in a $100 watch or a similarly priced clock might not greatly affect people receiving a $18.50 tax cut in November on incomes of $800 per week. The increases on items such as dog food, toothpaste, stationery et cetera for those people receiving tax reductions of only $1.92 because they receive weekly incomes of $500 down to as low as $150 will be tremendous. The $150 tax rebate for those with yearly incomes below $20,700, while admittedly costing $15 billion in the years to 1996-97, is a gesture in combating significant cost of living moves rather than an answer to the critics of the advisability of tax decreases and the inequity of its formulation.

         —Blair Badcock spoke of the `collapse of corporate investment' and the `collapse of private capital formation' in the vital tradeable goods sector, which most economists assumed would automatically flow from deregulation and the downscaling of the private sector. Coming from such a small base, it is technically correct—as another minister pointed out—that in the 1980s Australia had one of the highest growth rates of business R&amp;D amongst OECD regimes, and that 1991-92 involved a 4.8 per cent real increase over the year. He pointed out that the change was up there with the rates of Taiwan and Singapore.

         of 20 August is that `despite extensive efforts by the Federal Government to encourage, its business investment in research and development remains among the lowest in the OECD'. By then it was 0.5 per cent of GDP and faced Swiss, German and Japanese levels four times higher. Australia also trailed Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom and a host of other countries. In a report to DEEP, Dr Paul Twoomey showed that, even within this miserable effort, 80 per cent of the 948 R&amp;D utilised for concessional tax claims was concentrated in 100 larger companies. These have been the measures that cooperative research centres and the Australian technology group have applied to overcome this.

         Overall, there are indications that after three years of falls private business investment could flatten out in 1993-94. That is the hope given in a picture which saw manufacturing sector investment for the March quarter fall by 6.7 per cent, while before-tax profits increased by 21.4 per cent, according to the Bureau of Industry Economics brief.

         An era which has witnessed genuine productivity, such as the 2.5 per cent per worker rise last year, a deregulation of the financial sector, embryonic and tentative industry policy initiatives, historically low inflation and industrial disputation has, despite the promotional tales, been greeted by an abysmal business response. Labour shedding has been the most consistent cost cutting and entrepreneurial activity. Thus, in the last quarter, with minimal hiring, the share going to wages actually decreased by $300 million.

It was, indeed, a noble initiative to try to lift the pathetic efforts of our industry, which means a minority carried the research can. Thus Christine Wallace of the

        In a monumental cop-out the Australian National Audit Office further reported that the training levy did not fit many company structures. What an indictment!

Finally, paperwork has been simplified. Similarly, the Bureau of Industry Economics concluded that there has been no noticeable attributable upsurge in R&amp;D.

         —There are a lot of people in the Cowan electorate, and around Australia, who will be watching with anticipation the deliberations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues as it investigates the operations of the child support scheme. The many Australian families, and in particular those who are the custodial and non-custodial parents of broken families, who are serviced by the Child Support Agency around Australia, will be seeking some major changes to the operation of the child support system as a result of the joint standing committee's inquiry. I remind the House that the coalition has been concerned about the operation and effectiveness of the scheme, especially in relation to its administrative processes and the unnecessary emotional and financial stress placed on all parties, so much so that it went to the last election with a commitment to thoroughly review the operation of the child support scheme.

         I would like to use this opportunity to echo some of the comments of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) who recently highlighted some of the difficult situations his constituents were forced to bear as a result of the failing of the system in its present form. Since entering parliament, I have been inundated by constituents seeking some recourse for the unfair treatment they have received from the agency. They have been custodial and non-custodial parents; some have voluntarily come to arrangements with their former spouses; others have had to resort to the legal system; others have been denied basic legal representation because their delicate financial position has denied them legal assistance, yet they have not been able to meet the high cost of private legal aid.

         Before highlighting some of the cases of some of my own constituents—which are testimonies to the inherent deficiencies of the system—I would like to make an important point. No-one denies the fact that the work of the child support scheme is difficult, and more importantly it is important to note the improvements in the operation of the scheme since its inception. Despite the obvious problems of the present system, the previous scheme saw more than 70 per cent of maintenance orders not being complied with. The 1992 report of the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group found the following:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Child Support Scheme has achieved in its three years, greater reliability of child support payments for many people, fairer and more adequate amounts paid and better integration of the maintenance payment mechanism with the social security system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to this, it is important to remember that the Child Support Agency saved the Australian taxpayer approximately $74 million in 1992—an increase of over $19 million. Nevertheless, there appeared to be continuing areas of concern.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman's annual report 1991-92 noted that the Child Support Agency had more complaints made about it than any other government agency, with 922 complaints in 1990-91 compared with 1546 in 1991-92—an increase of 68 per cent. There can be no doubt that many of the problems experienced with the child support scheme—and more particularly the CSA—are exasperated by difficult and confrontationist attitudes of separated couples.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problems are not gender specific and, although custodial parents have to bear a disproportionate share of problems associated with the operation of the child support scheme—difficulties associated with late payments and the problems with arrears collections are examples—the bulk of my evidence suggests that the non-custodial male parent is most at risk of experiencing problems with the system.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I qualify this statement with the comment that it is difficult to make broad conclusions when the nature of these problems is essentially client specific. There are obvious examples where the problems experienced by custodial parents, and, particularly, non-custodial parents in second relationships, need serious attention. I would like to quote from a letter I recently received from a constituent who says:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . I have been advised that I am `caught' in a bureaucratic loophole and forgotten, becoming nothing more than a `number' or `statistic'. . . I am divorced and have only recently taken custody of my two teenage children. Prior to custody I was required by the family court to give my ex-wife 70% of all assets and matrimonial furniture and other items. I was also required to pay over 27% of my gross income to which I agreed and had deducted from my salary. My ex-wife was assisted also with a pension, rental assistance, and medical concessions . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously there are some inconsistencies. My constituent goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . my plight is that I have custody of two children, no assistance and in addition I have to pay 18% to a one year old child whose mother is approximately $15 000 per annum better off than myself with full recognition and subsidies against my nothing. Where is the justice . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The extent of the community's dissatisfaction with the present operation of the scheme can be gauged by the emotional intensity and sheer frustration that average Australians are forced to endure under the present system. No-one would deny that the intentions behind the establishment of the child support scheme are worthy. However, the day-to-day operation of the system still fails to meet the increasing demands and patience of the people it is meant to serve.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In my submission to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues investigating the operation of the child support scheme, I identified some of the recommendations suggested to me by local constituents, and these included a premarriage register of assets and liabilities; a consultation and counselling process for both parties; a reappraisal of the formula for financial judgments; the requirement that maintenance be used for the welfare of the children; stronger recourse for non-compliance of court orders; regular review of circumstances for either party; and improved departmental service. For the many Australian families and individuals who use the child support scheme, the inquiry presently being conducted by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is an important one.

         —This evening I want to talk about that rare combination in sport: a team of champions that is also a champion team—in fact, the world champions of rugby league. The Brisbane Broncos yesterday reaffirmed their position as the most outstanding rugby league side certainly in Australia and without parallel in the world. This year they managed to win the premiership from the fifth spot on the ladder, which is doing it the tough way. They put themselves through four sudden-death play-offs, each of which they won convincingly.

         I am pleased that the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) is in the chamber this evening. I extend my sympathy to him on the record, as I did earlier today in private. Yesterday as I drove around Brisbane I saw the houses all decked out in the maroon, white and gold streamers and balloons of the Brisbane Broncos. The party began in Brisbane well before kick-off time because the people of Brisbane had confidence in their home town team. Of course, the Broncos clubhouse at Red Hill was packed from mid-morning. I rang the Broncos club earlier this evening to see how things were going, only to discover that the party that had commenced yesterday morning is still under way. Apparently, some bus loads of supporters arrived back from Sydney early this morning and kicked on with those who stayed after the live telecast yesterday.

         I want to make a couple of comments about some of the players because the Brisbane Broncos have a genuine list of champions. They have young players who are simply bubbling with talent. I refer to people like Julian O'Neill, a full-back who yesterday really demonstrated his class; Steve Renouf, who is the Australian centre, who came back from a serious injury—a broken jaw—and played an outstanding match in the grand final; and replacement John Plath, a young fellow whom most clubs would be glad to have in their first line-up but who was proud to play for the Brisbane Broncos and is a great team player.

         The Brisbane Broncos have the sheer brilliance of a whole list of Australian representatives—the two best wingers in Australia, Michael Hancock and, in my view, the best winger in the world, Willie Carne; a centre of Chris Johns's ability; and a person who many people thought should have been player of the match, Kevin Walters. It is hard to talk about the team without acknowledging the little master of the game in the 1990s, Allan Langer.

         They had a forward pack that drove a much bigger St George pack backwards every play—and that included people such as Matterson and Lazarus, both of whom came back from injury. It was a back-to-back win: 1992 and 1993. Only the very best have been able to accomplish that. It is proof of the Brisbane Broncos' professionalism. They have, in coach Wayne Bennett, one of the most—if not the most—professional football coaches in this country. Their support staff include Kelvin Giles; they have a club management including people such as John Ribot, the best football chief executive in the competition; and a board of directors with people such as Paul Morgan and Barry Maranta. They are a first grade outfit.

As we look to the future and we realise that we will have the Queensland Crushers, Perth, Auckland, North Queensland and, of course, Canberra in the competition, it is not hard to envisage a finals series without a Sydney team at all. In that context, it is time for us to look to the future.

This motion shall be moved in the Senate for two reasons: firstly, the coalition believes the taxation treatment of credit unions should be reviewed to assess its impact on this industry and consumer choice; and, secondly, Labor has breached its election commitment not to increase taxes by attempting to remove partial taxation exemption of credit unions in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993.

          I would like to make the following comments in relation to the position that the credit unions have taken in this case. They have pointed out that section 23G of the Income Tax Assessment Act was enacted in 1974 to exempt from tax loan interest income from credit union members. At that time it was supported by both the government and the opposition of the day, with a clear recognition of the important social and economic role played by credit unions.

          The proposed removal of limited taxation exemption came as a complete surprise to the credit societies. They are absolutely bewildered in attempting to understand the Labor government's rationale for this move. The budget papers claim that the removal of section 23G will raise additional revenue of $25 million in 1995-96. But the credit unions contend that this will be substantially less. They question this figure because the estimate fails to recognise the squeezing of interest margins in a lower interest rate environment and the lower operating surpluses that credit unions will generate. Nevertheless, this amount is minuscule in the overall budget context. However, it will be a major burden on credit unions and their members.

          Although credit unions are relatively small in financial institution terms, there are 3.1 million members of Australia's 329 credit unions. These members have a level of communication with and commitment to their credit unions not found in a purely commercial relationship. I am sure that, if the proposals of the Labor Party were to be enacted, the credit unions would be in a position to voice their strong concerns about this iniquitous treatment from the Labor government.

          Credit unions are cooperatives; they are owned and funded completely by their members. Credit unions play a unique role in the retail finance sector. They are not for the individual profit of shareholders; they act equitably in the interests of all members. The most important point about this for Labor members opposite is that these credit societies provide a very important credit arrangement for low income earners. In many cases they are the last place these people can turn to for credit. They provide the so-called many true believers that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) keeps referring to with a savings and credit capacity that other institutions are not able to provide for them. All I can do is alert backbench members opposite, who are grinning at the moment, to the fact that, if they think they can get away with this iniquitous proposal, they have another think coming.

          In the true manner of all Sydneysiders, particularly people from the St George district, may I say that the Brisbane Broncos were not simply the best; they were truly the best on the day. We dip our hats to them. In so doing I want to congratulate the Saints. They played a great season and did very well. I want to point out to the House what a young and keen team this is—a team built from the ground up with many young players. Indeed, our eldest forward is only 25 years of age. A number of players on the paddock yesterday were barely 20 years of age.

We had just two. We also did not have the advantage yesterday of having practically a whole state from which to draw, as did the Brisbane Broncos. It is not that I decry for one moment their victory, but this raises a number of questions, not the least of which is the salary cap.

          There is a great benefit to teams in one-team towns of the added income that players can rightfully earn from endorsements and advertising. I would not for a moment suggest that we deprive them of it, but those teams in multiteam cities, such as Sydney, should have their salary cap raised somewhat to compensate for the higher income that players can earn in such places as Brisbane and Canberra, and no doubt will in Perth and New Zealand in 1995.

          I must object in the strongest possible terms to the suggestion that the semifinal series should be moved to Brisbane. It would be inconvenient for all but two of the 16 clubs in the Winfield Cup. That has to be taken into account. Sydney is now truly a multicultural city. The feeling in the St George district in the last few weeks—with our team in the grand final—of people from all walks of life and different original nationalities was absolutely superb. That is a very good case for keeping the semifinal series in Sydney.

If I can be so bold as to add to the words of our first lady, even Brisbane Broncos supporters can feel welcome in Sydney. It is the home of rugby league and must remain so. But I dip my hat—I am sure on behalf of all St George supporters—to the Brisbane Broncos. They were truly the best team on the day. I must say to the honourable member for Brisbane to watch out next year because we will be back.

         The budget increased the level of HECS payments and doubled the rate of HECS for second undergraduate degrees. In other words, the budget introduced new graduate tax imposts from a government that went to the polls promising not to increase taxation. These new taxes have been structured in an entirely regressive way. The government intends to jack up HECS payments for former students in the lowest income bracket by a whopping 50 per cent, by 25 per cent for those earning between $30,004 to $42,005 and by only 20 per cent for those on higher incomes.

         The Liberal Party is already fighting many of the unfair tax measures contained in this year's budget. The case against these two measures is quite clear. Each year, tertiary students sign a payment options form. They have the choice of paying tuition fees up-front or having them deducted from their earnings once they reach a certain level. The students who take the latter option sign a one-sided agreement with a party that can change conditions at whim.

         The increased HECS payments announced in the budget are an unexpected burden that will hit mainly young people trying to establish their careers. Students studying for second undergraduate degrees will face enormous debts. I received a letter on this subject today that made some particularly pertinent points. It said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What is the difference between a person who studies a combined Arts/Law degree and one who studies Arts then works for a short time . . . and returns to study Law? The difference is an increase of over $14,000 in HECS. The latter student is likely to have a total HECS bill of approximately $26,000 . . . Both students, whose ages will only be a couple of years apart, will be treated as equals by their potential employer and thus are likely to receive the same starting salary. However, the second graduate will have a crippling debt . . .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What is to happen to students who wish to do a combined degree and only have the present cashflow to do one at a time? They will pay double for being poor . . .
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The HECS increase does not only affect present students. It will also affect future students, the ones who are still at school. They will be forced to make life long career decisions at the end of their school life. It may be too expensive to change later.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is how the letter ended. The higher education contribution scheme is already fundamentally flawed. It is not fair to expect students to sign contracts that this parliament can suddenly change retrospectively. The Liberal Party's education policy was comprehensively rejected by students at the last election because they were afraid we would increase fees. A just HECS system should let students know the financial commitments they make. We should not leave threats of unexpected fee increases hanging over their heads as they establish their careers and make so many of the decisions that shape their lives.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should examine this sort of scheme in the future. By rejecting the government's proposals today we will be signalling our intention to make HECS fairer.

         I understand that when the Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), was still at school his headmaster one day summoned him to his study. He advised young John to forget about a university education. It must have been a blow, especially for a boy from a top private Perth school with such a prestigious reputation. But the resentment that day engendered does not excuse the way that the honourable member for Fremantle handled our universities as minister for education and is now treating our students as Treasurer. The budget plans for HECS are new and regressive tax measures. We should not let them pass in their current form.

        (3) Commonwealth agencies must comply with the 11 Information Privacy Principles of the Privacy Act. These can all be seen as privacy safeguards, but of particular relevance to the operation of data bases by agencies is Information Privacy Principle 4 which provides, in general terms, that agencies shall protect personal information, by such security safeguards as it is reasonable to take, against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure. Breaches of the Information Privacy Principles may result in complaints by individuals to the Privacy Commissioner that their privacy has been breached.

Information Privacy Principle 11 prohibits agencies from disclosing personal information unless the disclosure is consistent with one of the exceptions listed in paragraph 11.1. Disclosures which are thus permitted include disclosures with the consent of the person to whom the information relates, disclosures reasonably necessary for the protection of the public revenue, or the enforcement of the criminal law, and disclosures required or authorised by or under law, amongst others.

This notice clearly advises taxpayers they should not ignore their responsibilities.

It will be based on the 13 Week Treasury Note yield plus 4% and will be adjusted on a periodic basis. This will be roughly equivalent to the Prime Bank lending rate. This component is tax deductible.

        (a) and (b) The corner-stone of the Government's health policy is the universal health subsidies system of Medicare. Under Medicare, all Australian residents are provided access to medical care and pharmaceutical products at reasonable charges and access to hospital care at no charge. Within the Medicare arrangements, there is a range of measures, such as direct (bulk) billing and safety nets, which seek to protect individuals and families from unnecessarily high out-of-pocket costs. Health care cardholders are also provided access to a range of ancillary services at little or no out-of-pocket cost.

        Voluntary private health insurance co-exists with Medicare, however, it plays a supplementary role. There is a set of regulations and limitations which govern the role of private health insurance, including limits on the types of gap insurance that may be offered. These arrangements seek, on the one hand, to provide consumers with some choice and enable some mix of public and private sector involvement in health care financing. At the same time, they aim to ensure that consumers' interests are protected and that medical and hospital services' prices and health care costs for individuals and the community are constrained.

        One of the issues being addressed is ensuring that people who choose to take out private health insurance can do so on an affordable basis. A major reason people give up private health insurance is the gap between the amount covered by the private health insurance funds and the charges rendered by doctors. The Government, however, cannot allow the funds to cover any amount that doctors may care to charge. Consequently, I am looking at ways to ensure that additional costs to patients are eliminated or reduced.

        (1) The Government announced in the 1992-93 Budget that it would provide sponsorship of up to $10 million a year for a bank, building society, credit union or other financial institution selected by tender by the Department of Social Security to run a national home equity conversion loan scheme for age pensioners. The then Minister for Social Security, Hon. Neal Blewett, stated that he hoped the first loans would be available in April 1993. Because of the need to undertake a second tender process, the expected date for first availability of the loans is now 1 December 1993.

A marginally revised statement of requirements was subsequently issued by the Department of Social Security to all those institutions which had responded to the initial invitation to express interest. The main change was that, taking  account of advice from the Australian Government Actuary that the cost would be negligible, the Commonwealth agreed to underwrite half the risk to the successful tenderer of providing to the borrower a guaranteed minimum residual equity in the home of $20,000, indexed to the CPI. The tender process has now been completed and a preferred tenderer announced.

Drainage at the rear of the site and weed control are being maintained. In addition, the NCPA is investigating the feasibility of moving some high-quality native grass, which does not currently harbour the moth, to the adjacent Sydney Avenue road batter, in an attempt to improve its chances of survival. A landscape plan for the area is being determined, giving consideration to the need to maintain the grassland. The NCPA continues to monitor the site and further CSIRO monitoring is planned.

The proposed grassland translocation will be undertaken as part of future landscape works on York Park. The protective fence was erected in 1992 by Civil and Civic as part of the construction of Centenary House.

        (2) The decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relates to a person who did not have a tax file number and refused to apply for one. The Social Security legislation is specific where a person has a tax file number and the requirements are also satisfied when a person who does not have a tax file number applies for one. No other cases have been highlighted where payments were stopped to a person for non-compliance with the tax file number requirements who did not have a tax file number and refused to apply for one. The Department considers it unlikely that this decision would affect many other clients.

        (3) The intention of the relevant provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 is that the provision of a tax file number is a condition of payment. Where a person has a tax file number and refuses to supply it, there is no entitlement to payments. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision has exposed a possible loophole and goes  against the intention of the legislation. Consideration is being given to an amendment to put the issue beyond doubt.

        All reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will necessarily be examined in the course of the preparation of the Report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, required under Article 40 of the Covenant. The Report is currently being prepared by the Attorney-General's Department. On 16 December 1992 a Bill (the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill) making racial vilification unlawful was introduced into the House of Representatives. This Bill lapsed when the House was dissolved for the 1993 Federal election. The racial vilification legislation is currently under Government consideration. The Attorney-General, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will review the terms of Australia's reservation to Article 20 once the process of giving consideration to the legislation is complete.

        I understand that the situation regarding Australia's reservations to the CEDAW and the CPRW has not changed. However, I understand that significant policy developments in relation to the employment of women in combat and combat-related positions may have a bearing on the continuation of the reservation to the CEDAW concerning combat and combat-related duties and the similar reservation to Article III of the CPRW. This is because the circumstances which give rise to these reservations have now substantially changed.

        I understand the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (the SDA) currently allows women in the Australian Defence Force (the ADF) to be excluded from serving in positions which involve combat or combat-related duties. However, I understand that this exclusion from combat-related duties has not been applied since May 1990, the date from which the employment of servicewomen in combat-related positions has been progressively introduced. I understand that in December 1992, the Government announced a new employment policy for women in the ADF. Women are now able to serve in all positions except direct combat positions. I understand that it is likely that the Government will amend the SDA to remove the exclusion from combat-related duties, and instead restrict the exemption to Direct Combat duties which are those duties which may expose a person to a high probability of direct physical contact with an armed adversary. These changes will open almost 90 per cent of all positions in the ADF to women.

Seaman Officer specialists undertaking Bridge Watchkeeping Certificate training and consolidation are the largest group of the female seagoing population. The modified plan predicts the current rapid increase in female seagoing numbers will temporarily slow over the next few years, as a result of down-sizing and lower personnel separation rates.

        "60. An issue which impacts directly on the lives and aspirations of all indigenous Australians is the decision of 3 June 1992 by the High Court of Australia in the case of Mabo and Others—v—Queensland [No. 2] (1992) 175 CLR 1 (the Mabo case). The Mabo case concerned the legal rights of the Meriam people to the lands of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait. The High Court held, by a 6 to 1 majority, that the common law of Australia recognises a form of native land title to be determined in accordance with indigenous law and custom. It rejected the notion that Australia was a terra nullius, that is, land belonging to no one, at the time of settlement, and that native title to the land did not survive the vesting of radical title in the Crown at British settlement.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

        61. The majority also held that native title is capable of being extinguished by indigenous peoples losing their traditional link to the land, or by inconsistent legislation or government actions. In the case of the states and territories, any action that extinguishes native title must be in accordance with Commonwealth laws, in particular the RDA. Of most relevance are sections 9 and 10 of the RDA. In summary, section 9 makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction based on race which has the effect of impairing the enjoyment of any human right. Section 10 provides that where by reason of any law persons of a particular race do not enjoy rights enjoyed by persons of another race, then by force of that section the first mentioned persons enjoy that right to the same extent.

        62. The decision is likely to be most relevant to those of Australia's indigenous peoples who continue to lead a traditionally orientated lifestyle and maintain a traditional connection with land where native title has not been extinguished by, for example, an invalid grant of an inconsistent interest in land by the Crown.

The Australian Government has welcomed the decision and has recognised the complexity of the High Court's decision and its implications. These implications need to be considered carefully and as quickly as possible. The Government therefore has initiated consultations with State and Territory Governments, key Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and the mining and pastoral industries before deciding on the long term approach to the implications of the decision.
