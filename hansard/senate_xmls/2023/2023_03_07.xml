                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator </span>
                    </a>
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">RUSTON</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. These three bills before the Senate relate to the Prostheses List and private health insurance. This is the first step in the legislative process. These are the most comprehensive reforms to the Prostheses List that have ever been undertaken. These reforms come after more than four years of detailed work and collaboration by a number of people in the medical technology community with the former department and the former government. Stakeholders—MTAA, the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Catholic Health Australia and the Consumer Health Forum—have all been engaged in this years-long process to get us where we are today to ensure that this reform package both helps private health insurers remain sustainable and protects patient access and doctor choice to this very important part of our medical sector—that is, the Prostheses List. Getting these reforms right is really important. That's why I make a particular point of thanking all of those people who have been involved in getting this debate to where it is to enable the start of the legislative process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that medical devices and medical technology have had a major impact across the health sector. There has been a 30 per cent decline in annual mortality rates in the last 20 years, an overall increase in life expectancy of 4.1 years, and a 56 per cent reduction in the number of hospital days per capita. This is extraordinary. These statistics are not just numbers; they actually relate to fathers, husbands, wives, children, friends and loved ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important that we pass this legislation as the process has been undertaken in great faith. These bills present the first tranche of the legislative changes required to actually implement a coalition 2021-22 budget measure—modernising and improving the private health insurance Prostheses List. It has been hard fought. The coalition are absolutely happy to support the process and the progression of these bills because they do some very important things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying that, I note that, whilst the importance of this legislation cannot be overstated, there are some real concerns about the fact that so much of the information that is needed to underpin the moving forward of this initiative is completely absent and nobody has any line of sight whatsoever. This sector has no line of sight, this Senate has no line of sight, certainly the opposition has no line of sight and, in a funny way, I'm actually quite concerned that those opposite don't have any line of sight, because we have no information whatsoever. However, these three bills seek to do some reasonably sensible things. They ensure the ability to better define products that will be eligible to be on the list, they define the register levy and allow it to be implemented, and they better define the cost recovery framework that sits here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are really pleased to be able to stand here today and talk about these bills, because I think our track record demonstrates that we have a really strong record when it comes to strengthening private health insurance in this country. We believe that it is a fundamental part of Australia's health system. When we left government, private health insurance membership was at an all-time high, with more than 14 million Australians being covered. Our reforms included the 2022 premium charge, which was the lowest increase in premiums in more than 21 years and the eighth successive decline in premium charges since the last year that Labor was in government in 2013. We also increased investment in the patient rebate for private health insurance from $5.4 billion in 2012-13 to $6.9 billion in 2022-23. We also implemented the new easy-to-understand gold, silver, bronze and basics classifications for private health, standard clinical definitions and better access to mental health services which, sadly, we've seen this government start to unwind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know intrinsically that Labor governments are not great supporters of the private health insurance sector in this country, but I would encourage you to make sure that, when voting on these bills, we actually support a very strong private health insurance sector because that is what makes our overall health sector so strong in Australia. We are the envy of the world because we've got the right balance between the private sector and the public sector so that we are able to offer that choice and control to Australian consumers when they are patients so that they can access the broadest range of choice in health care of just about anywhere in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I mentioned a minute ago, the greatest problem with this legislation is the lack of transparency around the detail that sits behind it. There are certain key elements which aren't enabled by these bills and which we have no information on. Once again, we have a Labor government coming in here and rushing in legislation when they haven't actually done the work that sits behind it. The question has to be: is this government incompetent or is it trying to hide something from Australian consumers by refusing to provide the information that would set the minds of most of us at rest, if we knew what was sitting behind this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of key areas of great concern that I particularly want to raise here today and put on the record. First of all, the cost recovery framework regulations and rules haven't even been out for consultation yet, and yet we are seeking to put in place the mechanism for cost recovery with this legislation. Another example is the definition of a medical device. In terms of the guidelines, we need to know what will be included in future on the Prostheses List. We know that this legislation enables the process by which, going forward, many items that are currently on the Prostheses List will be removed, so we need to know what will be included in the future. As an example, an insulin pump would not necessarily be categorised as an implantable device, but obviously it's a very important device for those people with diabetes. So we need to know where that product will be going in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area of great concern is that in relation to all of the items that have been removed from the Prostheses List by this streamlining—often described as 'non-implantables'—the minister has made a verbal statement that he is going to mandate the requirement for those items to be included in general use to enable them to continue to be part of the refunding from the private health insurers. We have a promise of inclusion, but at this stage we still do not know what that is going to look like. IHACPA, the pricing authority, is out consulting as we speak. It hasn't reported yet; it doesn't have to report until after the likely passing of this legislation today. So we don't know how that bundling is going to occur. I think we've got a reasonable idea that the Department of Health and Aged Care and IHACPA have a preferred model for care, for this bundling. It appears they have a preference for bundling by facility type, but we know that the sector knows that it is a much more targeted way to make sure that we have got the correct kind of refunding and cost mechanisms in place for bundling if they are done through a procedure-bundling exercise instead of facility type.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said he's going to mandate the requirement for the cost inclusion of these items in general use for two years. The question then is: what happens after two years? Is the expectation that we're just going to set everybody against each other while they go and fight it out as to who is going to pay for these items that have been removed from the Prostheses List by this legislative framework?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the greatest concerns before us at the moment is about the time lines of the requirement for this bundling to come into effect. Industry have been categorical in saying they do not believe they will be in a position to implement these changes on 1 July 2023, which is the intention of this government. Once again, we have seen the rushing of a piece of legislation, to tick and flick something they said they were going to do, with no regard to the implications of those time frames for the people required to implement them. Most particularly, I don't think there has been any regard taken for the implications for patients, and the outcomes for patients and our overall health system, of the intention to push forward with this on 1 July.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know that the minister intends to speak to the IT vendors, who are the ones who will have to put this in place sometime between now and 1 July. Surely, Minister, government and health department, you should have had these things worked out before you came in here and asked this parliament to vote on something with no detail whatsoever and with huge concerns being raised by the sector that these details need to be known so they can understand whether they can meet the requirements that some of this legislation intends to mandate. We've seen it before. We saw it with the aged-care bills, and now we're seeing it here with these healthcare bills. As I said, most particularly, we want to make sure that the implementation of this time frame does not have the catastrophic impacts on patients that it could potentially have if it's forced through without any regard for what happens on the ground, what happens in the hospital and what happens to the patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be asking some of these questions because I believe the Greens intend to take these bills into committee. There are some questions the government needs to answer here. First of all, the government needs to guarantee that with the mechanisms we don't know about yet—the detail that sits behind this legislation that is only going to be under an instrument that can't even be disallowed—there will be no changes to surgeries that different hospitals are able to afford to deliver to their patients. Can it assure this chamber these changes are not going to have negative impacts on the current ability for a hospital to provide a particular process or procedure? I will ask the government a specific question, and I'd really like an answer to this: can you guarantee, as an example, that bariatric procedures will remain a cost-effective procedure for private hospitals to continue to provide to their patients, following the changes in terms of the implementation and the categorisation of both the cost framework and the bundling procedures? Will we just see many of the procedures that are currently being undertaken in public hospitals and private hospitals shoved into the public system because private hospitals will no longer be able to afford to provide these procedures?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are questions we need to have answered. We should have had these questions answered before we were asked to come in here and vote on these bills. Despite the fact that so many people in the sector have put so much time and effort into this reform process, we stand here today with so many unanswered questions that you should have been able to answer. You should have put the work in in relation to these uncertainties that the industry and the wider private health sector continue to raise about this proposed legislation. As I said, the industry have particular concerns that the enabling legislation will proceed without the critical details that they need to know to make sure that this is in the best interests of the patients that they serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation is currently to be undertaken between March and May. We're standing here at the beginning of March trying to push this through this place. Why are you rushing this legislation through, when you could have waited and allowed it to go through in a timely manner to ensure that no unintended consequences fall out of this rushed process? Why is it that you as a government continue to refuse to give us any oversight of the subordinate legislation that sits underneath this really important legislation? It might all be fine, but how would we know when, once again, your idea of transparency is not to tell us anything and your idea of consultation is to tell us what you're going to do?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to those opposite: the simplest approach to enable these concerns to be allayed across the broader sector would be to delay any further debate on these bills until May or June, after your consultation process has finished and we have confirmed details about the subordinate legislation. Right now, as we're standing here today, it looks as if we are going to make sure that good governance gets put to the bottom of the list, for legislative expediency. I don't think that's a very good way for us to be managing what is an extraordinarily important part of the Australian culture, something that Australians are so very proud of, our world-class health system. Sure, it's got some challenges at the moment, but those challenges will only be made worse by this government refusing to give any detail of what their intention is with the details of this sort of legislation. It has become a habit of this place, a habit of this government. It was elected on a platform of transparency, and I can say to you that, in my experience as the shadow minister for health and aged care, this government has been anything but transparent since it's been here. I have never seen such an opaque government in my entire life.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I want to start by indicating that the Australian Greens will be supporting the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. We do so while recognising that private health insurance is out of reach for too many people in Australia, and we acknowledge that the subsidy that this government provides to private health insurance corporations would be better spent and would better achieve health outcomes if we invested that money into the public healthcare system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As stated in the second reading amendment that I will be moving on behalf of the Australian Greens, those in our Australian community who can afford private health insurance, which is increasing in cost again this year, are experiencing a system which is expensive but which ultimately delivers them faster access to health care. The inherent and growing inequality at the centre of this equation is astounding. We are creeping ever closer to an American style healthcare system, and the Australian value of getting health care for free when you need it is getting further and further out of reach for so many. We've got to ask ourselves a fundamental question in this debate: why?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have learnt, in this space, that, when something seems out of place or out of step in this political building, in the decision-making processes of this place—when the government, whether it's the Liberal government or the Labor government, is making a decision that is fundamentally out of step with the needs of the community or what is in the community's best interests—there is often corporate money involved. And, lo and behold, the decision to not adequately resource our public hospitals, the decision to support an increase in private health insurance fees and the decision not to take immediate action to expand mental healthcare services to bring them under Medicare could, I believe, be firmly put down to the over $2 million of income the major parties received from private health insurers and pharmaceutical companies in the 2021-22 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this current cost-of-living crisis, we need to see more from this government—more in relation to the expansion of public healthcare systems. We need to see changes to the way that our public health system works to meet the community expectation and the community need. What I hear from people across WA is that, instead of their private health insurance fees increasing, they want to see mental and dental health under Medicare. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a deep dive for a moment into the reality of the current dental health crisis. Only 42 per cent of people between the ages of 25 and 34 have been able to go to the dentist in the last year. We know that people are delaying addressing ongoing dental issues because, instead, they need to do things like pay their rents as they increase, and they simply cannot afford to go to the dentist to get that urgent dental work done. Of those who can afford to make it to the dentist, nearly a quarter are not able to afford to fully treat the problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, there were 70,000 hospitalisations from dental conditions that could have been avoided. They could have been avoided. These are people that ended up in hospital when there would have been no reason for them to be there if they had simply been able to receive dental treatment earlier. Nearly 9,000 of those cases were in my state of Western Australia. On average, an Australian will spend $326 in out-of-pocket dental costs per year, nearly seven times what the government pays on average, per capita, in subsidies to dental health care. These stats are a snapshot of why I dearly wish that the parliament were working on a bill to pass dental care into Medicare today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for mental health care, we have, again, a familiar story. People are unable to get the mental health supports that they need right now. Services are not available locally. There are very long waiting lists, or there are simply closed books. And, if you can get onto somebody's books and get in to see someone, cost is then an additional barrier. What does Labor do in response to this reality, the crisis of mental health care in this country, particularly in the aftermath of one of the worst periods of crisis in this country that we have seen in many years in relation to the healthcare system? It has pushed incredible weight upon people's mental health. The reality is that, for young people in Australia, there is an absolute and total mental health care crisis in this country. It is unparalleled in its history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does Labor do in response to this absolute reality? They have stopped the 20 subsidies in the Better Access healthcare scheme, and they have wound them back to 10. Let me say that again. In the face of a mental health care crisis overwhelmingly falling on the shoulders of young people, this Labor government has decided to wind back the 20-session subsidy under the Better Access scheme to 10 sessions. It is absolutely unbelievable. The reason they've given for this disgraceful decision is some mumblings about capacity in the system. They've referenced reports and reviews, even though those reports and reviews do not, in fact, recommend rolling back the 20 sessions; they recommended the augmentation of the system. So, in the face of these reports and realities and endless submissions from mental-healthcare peak groups, this government rolled back those subsidies and blamed it on capacity. And, when anyone calls them out on the absolute nonsense of that—the disconnected, illogical nature of looking at massive unmet need in the system and responding by constraining access—this government looks you in the face and says, 'Well, we've got to balance the budget; we've got to make sure the books add up,' while, at the same time, it gives a quarter of a trillion dollars to some of the richest people in this country, in the form of the stage 3 tax cuts. It's absolutely disgusting. In no other area of Australian public policy would it be acceptable to respond to an increase in need by constraining access and then claiming that you're doing the right thing by the community that is demonstrating that increased need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing the cost-of-living barriers is exactly what this government should be doing, by expanding the system so that people can get what they need, when they need it, where they are, without that being determined by them having to choose—having the luxury of choosing!—between health care or mental health care and paying their rent. These are basic expectations of the Australian community. Australians should not have to rely on private health insurance to get timely access to health care. It is time to prioritise public health care and to get dental and mental health into Medicare, where they have always belonged. And it is time to get this done now. This is what Australia needs. This is what the Greens will continue to work on, until people are able to access this relief and until these goals are achieved.</span>

I know that, when he comes into this place, he is always sincere and passionate and he believes everything he says in this place—there can be no doubt about that. But let me say this. The best strength of our healthcare system in Australia, and what makes us different from other countries, is the strength of both our private health system and our public health system. Each buttresses the other. If this country were ever to undermine the strength of our private health system, it would be a disaster—an absolute disaster for those who need to access the public health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you one example from my home state of Queensland which I think summarises the position extremely well. In 2012, on dental health lists in the public system in Queensland there were 62,513 people. There were more than 62,000 Queenslanders who'd tried to access dental health care in Queensland under the previous Labor government, before the LNP government was elected in 2012. That's 62,513 Queenslanders. Some had been on that waiting list for up to 10 years. In 10 years, they couldn't access the public health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP government was elected in 2012. Within two years, how many people were on the public health system waiting list for dental health care? Remember: it was over 62,000. Was it 20,000? No; fewer. Was it 10,000? No; fewer. Was it 500? No; fewer. There were none—none. In two years, that waiting list had been taken from 62,513 to zero. How? By leveraging the private health system—by the government giving people vouchers so they could go and see a private-sector dentist and get their teeth fixed. Within two years no-one was on that dental healthcare waiting list—not a single person. That is the power of having a system which mobilises the private health system. Those who can afford it, such as I, get private health insurance, and if we don't get it we're punished under our tax system. And that's the way it should be, to make sure that our public health system is there and available for those who are most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Queensland, there are 2,354,000 Queenslanders with private health insurance. I say to each and every one of those Queenslanders: it would be a disaster, an absolute disaster, if this country adopted the Greens policy. This was their policy, and I've got it here: the Greens policy from the last federal election was to abolish the private health insurance rebate. That was the Greens policy. It would be a disaster. We would see waiting lists far in excess of that 62,513 if we abolished that healthcare rebate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know, and the people in the gallery will know, for friends and family it's nearly their No. 1 priority to make sure they have got their private health insurance coverage. Many pensioners, many people on retirement incomes, scrimp and save to make sure they have that private health insurance, and they deserve a rebate. They deserve to be rewarded by that insurance rebate, and those of us in higher income brackets deserve to be punished if we don't have private health insurance. That is how we get the best outcomes in our healthcare system—the public system working together with the private system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be a disaster for the people of this country if we ever change that system and rely simply on a public healthcare system, which is what the Greens are advocating. It will be a disaster for the most vulnerable of Australians, and I will certainly make sure, up to the next election, that people who voted Green at the last federal election in my home state of Queensland—in the seats of Ryan, Brisbane and Griffith—know that the Greens policy is to abolish the amount you get back for getting private health insurance coverage. I will make sure that every one of those voters knows that the Greens are coming after their private health insurance rebate. The Greens don't believe in the private health system. They're coming after your private health insurance rebate. I will make sure I remind those Queenslanders every day between now and the next federal election that the Greens are coming after their private health insurance rebate, because I think it would be a disaster for the health system in this country if the Greens were successful in what is clearly, patently, an ideological obsession against private providers of anything. It's an ideological obsession which would be a disaster for the most vulnerable in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having made those introductory comments, I'll move now to some of the particulars of the legislation in this case. The coalition, of course, supports this legislation. It reflects much of the work that was done by the coalition government. This is an example of an orderly transition in our democratic government, with policies which were introduced by a prior government being continued under the next government where they're in the best interests of the Australian people. It is something we should acknowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are concerns, however, with respect to the lack of detail in the legislation. As senators know, I have a particular concern, wherever it applies, when there isn't sufficient detail in the legislation to understand how a system is going to work in practice. On this occasion, there are a number of areas where the legislation is lacking, and we haven't seen all the regulations and delegated legislation which actually put the meat on the bones of a lot of this legislation and how it will operate in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some significant issues which are going to be dealt with in regulations that we haven't seen yet, and, as we all know, the devil is often in the detail. These are some of the issues: eligibility criteria with respect to the crucial health items that fall within this legislation, listing pathways, specifications for the calculations of cost recovery, regrouping and payments for removal items et cetera. Bear in mind that, with respect to this legislation, those who are providing private health insurance, private health coverage and these sorts of services and items in the Australian community were given less than one week to consider the draft legislation—less than one week. We need to do better than that, surely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concern I have is that when legislation is introduced in a rush there are always unintended consequences. The devil is always in the detail. There are fundamental concerns about the process with respect to this legislation and how it's made its way into the Senate. The bills provide little detail about the extent or specificity of the powers to be implemented through unsighted subordinate legislative instruments and mechanisms. We just don't know the powers that underlie this legislation. Who's going to exercise those powers? What are going to be the ramifications of those powers? It's also done in regulation, which means this chamber has less opportunity to oversee that legislation and to assert our will and our concerns through disallowance procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our opposition shadow minister, Senator the Hon. Anne Ruston, raised specific concerns and asked a particular question. I'll put that particular question here again today: are there going to be any changes to the ability of private health hospitals or other private institutions to provide particular surgeries and undertake particular procedures? Let me put it this way: will a private hospital undertaking a type of surgery today be able to do it tomorrow, once the regulations come into effect? Now, that's a pretty basic question. What is going to be the impact of the regulations on private hospitals in terms of the surgery they can undertake? Are they going to be prevented tomorrow, through the operation of the regulations, from doing a procedure that they can do today? That's the sort of detail we should have as we're discussing this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, because so much of the detail—and this happens again and again in this place—is going to be buried in regulations, senators from all jurisdictions, all the states and the territories, aren't going to have the ability, transparency and visibility to identify particular concerns for their constituents. The system shouldn't work that way. We should have that visibility and transparency so we can raise legitimate concerns with respect to how this legislation is going to work in practice. But at the moment we just don't have that visibility, and I think the government should reflect on that. It is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for draft legislation to be released by the government of the day—I don't care of which political persuasion—and for key stakeholders to only have one week to actually give feedback on that draft legislation. If there are unintended consequences, as invariably there are—no-one's perfect—then the only way we can introduce in this place legislation which is effective and efficient and protects the interests of all Australians is to have a genuine consultation process with respect to the draft legislation so that we can get the views of those who know the most about how legislation like this applies in practice. This chamber and the Australian people have been denied this opportunity because this legislation has been so rushed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this legislation, we can also see one of my key bugbears in this place. We have subordinate legislation which is going to be introduced, potentially, and there are questions over whether or not that subordinate legislation is going to be subject to disallowance. This is, again, unacceptable from my perspective. Any subordinate legislation and any regulations which are going to impact rights, liberties, freedoms and opportunities, or which are going to have any negative impact on Australians and their interests, should be subject to disallowance in this place. They should be subject to any of us as senators introducing a vote, saying, 'This isn't good enough,' and prosecuting our arguments on the floor of this chamber and trying to persuade a majority of our colleagues to our view. We should have the opportunity to have that debate with respect to regulations that can have such a serious impact on the lives of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I certainly do support the intent behind this legislation. I do have material concerns with respect to how that intent is going to be translated into the regulations, because those regulations could have a material impact on Australians seeking particular surgery in the private health sphere. We need to have detail with respect to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the strength of our health system is built on two foundations: the strength of our private health system and the strength of our public health system. We get the best health outcomes for all Australians when we have both a strong private health system and a strong public health system. I say to those Queenslanders who voted Green at the last federal election: we will be reminding you, between now and the next election, that the Greens are coming after your private health insurance rebate. That will be a disaster for many thousands of people. Over two million Queenslanders have private health insurance. In my view it will also be a disaster for our public health system because a successful Australian health system depends on a strong private system and a strong public system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256136" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I rise to offer a brief contribution on  the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 and on the topic of private health insurance more generally. As Senator Scarr has pointed out, we do have a health system that is a mix of public and private health care. Our tax system actively incentivises many Australians to hold private health insurance. In fact, from the most recent statistics that I can see, well over half of us now have private health insurance. That number has been growing since the pandemic. People obviously value their health and they are taking up private health insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given these incentives and the potential extra tax for not having private health insurance, I feel that we as a parliament have a duty to ensure that the system is working efficiently and is delivering the care that Australians need. The system clearly has its challenges. A range of commentators have expressed various views, but it's really important that we remember this is affecting the lives of Australians. People feel the effects when the system, whether it is private or public, doesn't work for them. This is something I hear a lot about from my community here in the ACT. People are frustrated with what they see at times as a lack of value. I'll give you one example. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently heard from a gentleman living in the south of Canberra. He had been to have a treatment at a prosthodontist. It cost him $1,500. He was reimbursed just $57 by his fund, despite having paid, he estimates, around $47,000 in premiums over the last 15 years. I don't claim to know the specifics of this case and the level of coverage he had, but it's hard to see that this gentleman received value for his investment in this specific interaction. Over the last 15 years he has paid over $3,000 and he is out of pocket $1,400 for a procedure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year the ACCC delivers to the Senate a report highlighting some of the key trends in private health insurance. I thought I would highlight some of the figures that stood out to me in their 2020-21 report. The average gap expense for hospital treatment increased by 9.5 per cent on the previous year. It has increased by 23 per cent over the last five years. Private health insurance management costs have increased by eight per cent, or about $200 million. That's an extra $200 million in salaries, management costs and bonuses. At the same time, the number of exclusionary policies grew by 150,000 or around 4.6 per cent. According to the ACCC, this is part of a long-term trend which has seen the number of policies with exclusions grow from 28.7 per cent in 2012 to 61.3 per cent today, which is likely a function of people cancelling top cover and opting for low-cost, basic policies to avoid the added tax expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in some good news, the industry appears to be making good on their promise not to profit from the pandemic and has reported returning a total of $2.1 billion to consumers up to 30 June last year. It's also worth noting that premium increases have generally been lower over the past couple of years—certainly lower than inflation. However, the cost of living is really hurting Australians at the moment, and every percentage point matters. From the insights delivered by the ACCC, it's clear that the system is just not working as hard as it can for patients. It can work harder. That brings me to these prostheses benefits that are the topic of the bills before us today. I've spent a number of weeks delving into this legislation and some of the complexities. I can report that it is, indeed, a complex area of policy. It's a system that seems to be quite precariously balancing a number of interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the government entered into a four-year agreement with the medical technology industry to drive savings on prostheses benefits. Prostheses benefits will now reduce over the next four years and will be aligned with public sector prices. However, the prices won't be able to fall below a seven per cent floor; they will have to be seven per cent higher than in the public system. It should be noted that the ACCC has raised some concerns with these arrangements in its report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the ACCC welcomes efforts to reduce the underlying cost of prostheses, the ACCC notes that the MoU's floor on prostheses benefit reductions is likely to have some distortionary impacts on prices for medical devices in private healthcare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand this is a complex system and there are many different factors to take into account. In some instances, it's very hard to compare what's happening in the public system with the private system. But, putting that aside, these savings that have been committed to—around $900 million, almost a billion dollars of savings on the table over the next four years from the medical technology industry—should be delivered to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have drafted an amendment that would mean that there is an update to the longstanding OPD where the ACCC reports into private health. It would simply look at how much of these savings is being realised from this agreement and how much of them is being passed on to consumers, which is something that I think this parliament has a duty to do. When these sorts of savings are put on the table for consumers, we can put processes in place that actually check on them and make sure that they are flowing. We can't have a system where large deals are agreed to by government and then have no scrutiny. There really is no point in having this generous offer of almost a billion dollars over four years and it not flowing to consumers. People who are paying their premiums every month for themselves, their partner or their whole family deserve to see a share of that almost $1 billion in savings. I have circulated an amendment. I believe it is a very minor one; it is simply adding a little bit more scrutiny. I would hope that the Senate will support it. I do not see a good reason not to support transparency measures, given this generous deal that we've seen that is going to deliver these savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like, just finally, to raise some concerns about the lack of visibility of the delegated legislation. Senator Scarr has also raised this. As a new parliamentarian, I've been pretty shocked, frankly, at how much is done by delegated legislation from ministers. I understand that's how it's done, but there should be scrutiny of that. Ideally we'd have the ability to debate it and potentially amend it here in the Senate, but, if there are bills that simply allow delegated legislation, I really believe that there should be visibility over that delegated legislation so we can have a look at it and have the debate in this context, rather than having to try and use what is the very blunt instrument of disallowance. For me, the first option is certainly preferable. Being on the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation, I really would echo Senator Scarr's concerns around non-disallowable instruments. Parliamentarians are elected by their electorate, or by their state or territory, to scrutinise legislation, and to have a system where there are a whole range of things that are non-disallowable doesn't make sense to me. To me, it doesn't pass the pub test when it comes to politicians being elected to represent the people that vote for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this legislation. I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment, which I commend to the Senate. I really believe that it would add a layer of scrutiny without slowing up or affecting what is proposed at all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I thank the senators for their contributions to the debate on the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. This package of bills supports the implementation of a 2021-22 budget measure, modernising and improving the private health insurance Prostheses List. As other senators have observed, it arises after an extended period of consideration and reform. These bills represent the first tranche of legislative change required to fully implement measures that will support modernising and improving the private health insurance Prostheses List.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first bill is the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022. This bill inserts definitions of medical devices and human tissue products into the legislation, which will better define the kinds of products that, along with additional criteria contained in the legislative instrument, will be considered eligible for set benefits from private health insurers. The bill also provides for the renamed Private Health Insurance (Medical Devices and Human Tissue Products) Rules. This new name is reflective of the modernised and amended scope of the legislation. The bill also updates the cost recovery arrangements to support predictable and sustainable fee-for-service arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill is the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022. This bill provides for levies payable by medical technology sponsors for the listing of medical devices and human tissue products. These levies are essential as they allow the department to administer the listings in a financially sustainable and appropriate manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third bill is the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022, which is machinery in nature only and does not change any current requirements or obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will modernise and improve administrative processes and cost recovery arrangements. They are long-awaited improvements that will assist in keeping downward pressure on private health insurance premiums by reducing the costs associated with medical devices and human tissue products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the report from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and the government has circulated an amendment for the committee stage which goes to that. We would expect to speak to that in the committee stage. I note, too, the second reading amendments that have been moved and foreshadowed during the course of the debate. The government is not supportive of these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly speak to the second reading amendment on sheet 1826. We are aware that some stakeholders report practices between hospitals and sponsors that may constitute anticompetitive behaviour. These are usually investigated by the ACCC, supported by a body of evidence that can support the claims. The ACCC establishes an annual program of work, and any inquiry into the Prostheses List would be subject to the priorities of the ACCC. Given that such an inquiry would take some time to establish and report following a reference from the Treasurer, the government is committed to shorter-term reforms that will make a significant impact. A key component of the Prostheses List reform is the development of a new compliance framework. This will include standard regulatory regime provisions for effective monitoring, investigation, referral and enforcement. Essential to the compliance framework is the ability to gather information from stakeholders and to share information with relevant regulators on matters of noncompliance, and the ACCC and the TGA are key regulators for referring matters of noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is working to introduce legislation in the spring sittings to establish the compliance framework for safeguarding the Prostheses List. In the meantime, a number of existing laws continue to apply to Prostheses List stakeholders. These include: the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which regulates the supply and advertising of therapeutic goods, including medical devices; the Australian Consumer Law, which deals with misleading or deceptive conduct in trade and commerce; and the Criminal Code, which deals with providing false or misleading information to Commonwealth entities. We consider these mechanisms appropriate while the broader reforms are being rolled out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the amendment circulated and moved by Senator Steele-John: all Australians deserve access to affordable treatment and medical devices to stay healthy and to live full and productive lives. Private health insurance works with our public healthcare system to offer Australians more choice in health services and encourages those Australians who can afford to do so to contribute to the cost of their own health care, taking some of the pressure off public hospital systems and waiting lists. More than half the Australian population—about 14½ million people—have private health insurance. Australians, it seems, want to exercise choice about their health care. Private health insurers must ensure their members are getting value for money. When costs rise, they want to know higher premiums are contributing to system-wide improvements like higher wages for nurses and other health workers. As I indicated, all Australians deserve access to affordable treatment and the devices they need to stay healthy and to live full and productive lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I again thank senators for their contributions and for the courteous spirit in which the debate took place. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

I did step through that in my second reading remarks, but I am happy to touch on it in brief terms again. I think, for a number of reasons, we didn't support the Senate making a direction of this kind. The first reason is that, essentially, this power exists with the ACCC. The Treasurer has a capacity to require an inquiry of this kind, but, in the end, the ACCC has a capacity for investigation, and they establish their priorities according to their resources and the issues before them. I think the second one was really about time frames. There is a new compliance framework being developed. It includes the ability to gather information from stakeholders and share information with relevant regulators on matters of noncompliance. There is a framework which is being brought forward. In the meantime, as I indicated in the second reading remarks, there are a number of existing powers which apply to participants in this market.</span>

Given there's a new agreement, with $900 million on the table and people keen to ensure they're getting value for money with their premiums, why can't we at least know if that money is being passed on, given the ACCC is looking at this anyway?</span>

I'm advised that the issues that you are raising interact in complicated ways with the health portfolio because, of course, the ACCC is a Treasury agency. The public sector advisers who are here to provide advice today in the Senate are drawn from the health department. However, I think Minister Gallagher would be happy to have a further discussion with you about this, but we would need some time to obtain the necessary advice.</span>

I'm wondering if there's any brief summary you can give us on the determination of those items. There must have been some sort of clinical definition as to why they were removed, and I'm wondering whether it's possible to get the meeting papers in relation to the removal of those items.</span>

I accept that you've taken it on notice, but I think what I'm trying to get to is the very nature of the fact that we have before us this bill that actually provides a whole series of enabling capabilities for the government to do things, not the least of which is the removal from the Prostheses List of in excess of 400 items that now have to be dealt with by an alternative funding model. Obviously, this is of significant concern more broadly because it could potentially have very significant impacts on the delivery of services. I accept that you're not the minister—you're a representing minister—and I appreciate you want to take these on notice, but, given that this bill is going to come back a little bit later this afternoon or maybe tomorrow, I'd really appreciate being able to understand whether you've actually assessed the impacts of how you might proceed in dealing with the funding or the payment of these particular items as it impacts on actual procedures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an example, I asked in my speech in the second reading debate: can you guarantee that bariatric procedures, which use a significant number of the items that will be transferred off the Prostheses List into this new general use area, will remain cost-effective for delivery by private hospitals through this insurance mechanism following the changes? The thing that I think everybody wants to find out about what's going on here is whether the procedures that are currently being undertaken are not going to be detrimentally impacted by the changes. That's all we're seeking to understand, so it's concerning that we're standing here today without having that information.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Today I rise to talk about a hidden gem of Western Australia: Swan Valley. I recently had the pleasure of showcasing the Swan Valley to Kevin Hogan, the shadow minister for trade and tourism. The valley, of course, is in the electorate of Hasluck. It was a day of flowers, chocolate and great wine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Swan Valley is just a short 30-minute drive from Perth's CBD. It was my pleasure to showcase where vines were first planted in Western Australia nearly 200 years ago. Our first stop was the award-winning Swan Valley Visitor Centre, where we received a briefing on the history of the valley and information on the 150-plus wineries, breweries, distilleries and, of course, fine restaurants. I thank the City of Swan very much for your very warm welcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second stop was an amazing small business—actually, not so small anymore—called Wafex. This extraordinary family business, through passion and multiple generations of hard work, now has over 100 staff, and they're distributing Aussie flowers to 25 countries globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our next stop was the magical Margaret River Chocolate Company and also Providore, which is well known to all Western Australians in Margaret River, but not many know that there is also a factory and an outlet in the Swan Valley. Not only did we purchase our Easter goodies; we also got to see how the magic is made and how chocolate Easter eggs and their many other delicacies are made.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our last stop was lunch at the iconic Sandalford Wines, an historic winery, restaurant and major events venue. It's one of the many wineries in the valley and a mainstay of any winery tour of the valley. I cannot endorse it more.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  A couple of days ago, on Sunday 5 March, it was Clean Up Australia Day. This is an annual event that sees thousands of Australians get out and about in their communities to clean up, fix up and conserve our environment. It's the good old-fashioned power of people. It's a recreational fishing group removing marine debris. It's school students keeping their neighbourhood clean and tidy. It's tree-planting groups removing litter from a local reserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no different in my neck of the woods in Far North Queensland, where we are lucky enough to have both the wet tropics rainforests and the Great Barrier Reef on our doorstep. Just this weekend the Hekili Outrigger Canoe Club, based out of Yorkeys Knob, held their own clean-up event, and it was very well attended. We know the challenge of cleaning up at these events is a positive, practical action that makes a difference to the health of our planet, but that challenge goes far beyond one day. I also know that there are individuals, groups and businesses right across this country that are doing their bit day in, day out to help. As Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, I see this commitment every single day in our communities, with groups like the Tangaroa Blue foundation, who I was fortunate enough to join forces with recently to host a community beach clean, alongside the Dawul Wuru rural rangers and local residents. We removed over 33 kilograms of rubbish from a local beach and waterway that feeds directly into the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am incredibly proud of these groups and the work that they do. I'm also proud that as a Labor government we've got straight to work to restore our environmental credibility, to recognise the value of our natural environment and to take real action on climate change. We couldn't do it without the community on the ground. We will back their commitment with real action, and we're seeing that already. Just a few months ago, Australia signed a strong determination to end plastic pollution around the world. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The people on the lawns were angry. They felt powerless, and they felt that no-one cared about or was listening to them. They were people who have sought asylum here in Australia, risking their lives to free themselves from oppressive regimes in places such as Afghanistan, Iran, Syria. Most had been locked up here in Australia or offshore for many years just for exercising their right to seek refuge. Many have had fast-tracked visa applications rejected unfairly, and now they exist on temporary or bridging visas, with children not permitted to attend university. Some are not able to access Medicare, and they are not able to bring their ageing parents to join them here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Karima from Melbourne said to me that she and her family had been in limbo for the past 11 years and have never felt settled in this country that they wish to call home. They feel betrayed by the government. Some shared photos they'd taken with a smiling Andrew Giles soon after the election. Despite some changes promised by the government, 10 months on thousands of people are continuing to live in so much pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I promised them that I would continue to speak out on their behalf, for speedy processing of their visas and for their rights to study, to work, to health care and to bring their ageing parents here to be with them. Above all I call on the government to listen to the families I met this morning and to treat them with care and humanity as fellow human beings, rather than political problems. To Karima, Hayder, Hussein, Rocyia, Zainab, Ibrahim and everyone I met this morning I say: I care, the Greens care, and we will keep fighting for you until justice is achieved for you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Welcome to country ceremonies are now as ubiquitous as they are inescapable. Australians are forced to sit through these rituals everywhere from the commencement of parliament to school assemblies. They're now more common than singing our national anthem, and, far from being an ancient practice, these rituals began to be used by progressive activists in the early 2000s. The practice suggests that Australians whose families have lived here for generations, possibly since settlement, are not welcome. The welcome to country is nothing more than something wealthy city people love to do to make themselves feel good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians have the right to call this country home, but the activists and bureaucratic classes want division as it perpetuates the victimhood mindset that they use to manipulate people. By the way, when is reconciliation actually going to be achieved? What does it look practically? Will it be achieved when we have a treaty, when Australians are paying some sort of rent tax, or perhaps when there is a new Indigenous nation that will further divide Australians? The answer is that activists will never be happy, and we all know it because bitterness and resentment are their bread and butter. So, next time you're asked to participate in one of the ceremonies remember that, despite what they say, refusing doesn't make you a racist. Here's my memo to the grievance industry: thanks for the virtue theatre, but, like most Australians, I'm sick and tired of being welcomed to my own country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Hundreds of truck drivers and their families are marching on Aldi stores around Australia today, demanding that Aldi take responsibility for the crisis in their supply chain. Already 45 people have died in truck crashes this year, including 10 truck drivers. Last week we saw the collapse of one of the largest cold chain logistics companies in Australia, Scott's Refrigerated Logistics. Scott's had revenues last year of half a billion dollars, but their margins were so razor thin that they were not able to survive. John Waltis, a driver at Scott's, said: 'Myself and 1,500 others just lost our jobs at Scott's because of the squeeze on transport contracts from the top. One of my mates had just had a baby and now he's lost his job. Retailers like Aldi are responsible for this.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic pressure from Audi, Amazon and others like them have squeezed margins and drivers quite literally to their deaths to meet another trucking cost. Many drivers are forced to overwork, speed and delay maintenance just to make ends meet—45 deaths, 1,500 jobs lost, countless families ripped apart. However, Coles and Woolworths have committed to safe and sustainable supply-chain practices, and I commend them for turning around and taking those steps. But Aldi and Amazon are standing by their deadly practices. The Transport Workers Union has called on Aldi, Amazon and 38 others to join Coles and Woolworths in committing to safe and fair supply chain practices. This government is committed to reform in this space. Blood is on the hands of Aldi, Amazon and other companies at the top of the supply chain operating like them.</span>

The National Assistance Card is an initiative of the Brain Injury Association of Tasmania and it has been made possible thanks to the Australian government's Information, Linkages and Capacity Building grants, its ILC grants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Assistance Card is a personalised card that explains the cardholder's unique areas of difficulty and how you can assist them. A QR code on the card links to more detailed information and the cardholder can also upload a short video. One situation where the card is particularly useful is when the cardholder's behaviour is misunderstood by others and the cardholder, due to their disability or stress or anxiety, has difficulty explaining their disability and the assistance they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A great example of this is when Hobart woman Cate Curwood, who has an acquired brain injury, was experiencing sensory overload in a store and inadvertently walked out without paying. With the help of her National Assistance Card she was able to explain her situation to store security. The National Assistance Card is currently available to anyone throughout Australia with an acquired brain injury and is currently being trialled in Tasmania for people with autism. In fact, one of my staff has one for his six-year-old autistic son. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there is a small fee for the card, the cost per cardholder would be unaffordable without government funding for the project. It has the strong support of many agencies, including police services, throughout Australia. I hope that this project can not only continue but expand to cover people with any kind of disability or severe health condition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate everyone involved in this project, including the Brain Injury Association of Tasmania, Autism Tasmania, Business Software Tasmania and the Department of Social Services.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I rise today in March 2023. Just two short months away is May 2023, when we will see the first anniversary of this government and we'll see its second budget delivered. They are under pressure now. They have a test, from the Australian people, as to how they handle the cost-of-living crisis that is ravaging Australian families. Small businesses, individuals and families, in particular, are under extraordinary pressure. You do have to wonder, given the answers we've heard in this place and the other place, whether this government has any clue as to what to do to the cost-of-living pressures that families are under.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher, the Minister for Finance, has been asked on numerous occasions—probably more numerous than she'd like to count in this place—what the government is doing to alleviate cost-of-living pressures. The only things she can name are policies that the Labor Party announced prior to the last election, prior to the record and rapid rises in interest rates that we've seen over the past 10 months. In fact, most of those policies that she cites as alleviating cost-of-living pressures were announced in 2021—before we saw rises in interest rates, before we saw the rampant inflation that is present in this country. It was at a time when the Labor Party were still promising people real wage increases, which they haven't delivered. The Australian people are watching the Labor Party in the upcoming budget. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Today Diversity Council Australia released groundbreaking research on the experiences of culturally and racially marginalised women in leadership, and it contains disturbing findings. Code-switching and white-adjusting to adapt their behaviour closer to whiteness are a sad reality for culturally and racially marginalised women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighty-three per cent of women reported experiencing pressure to act, look and sound like existing leaders—who are often white men. Seventy-five per cent of women reported that others assumed they worked in a lower-status job and treated them as such. Eighty-five per cent of women felt that they had to work twice as hard to get the same treatment. Sixty-one per cent of women reported experiencing racism at work in the past two years, while 48 per cent experienced sexism at work over the same period. I can relate to many of these intersectional experiences. When racism and sexism intersect it is visceral, and it is damaging. Yet it is denied and ignored, and women of colour keep being marginalised in workplaces. Australia has a blind spot where racism is concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Diversity Council notes that for many in Australia, particularly those experiencing racism, the current language of 'culturally and linguistically diverse' is outdated and problematic. The council found that many women prefer the term 'CARM'—culturally and racially marginalised—over 'CALD' as it is more accurately capturing their experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terms like 'CALD' have had their day. They bunch together people whose experiences are very different under the same label. They might sound nice but can make invisible the people who face racism on a daily basis and the harm that it causes. To have a meaningful conversation about building an antiracist Australia, we have to tell it like it is: race and racism are used to marginalise people, and their impacts on women are compounded. This has to change.</span>

This has been a long-running issue and it is an issue that hasn't been addressed by politicians. That needs to change. We have to look after the tradies who are doing the work to build our towns, our cities and all the infrastructure that we rely on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Murray produced his report in 2017, but we've seen no action from either side. At best, subbies can write off as losses payments they were meant to have. At worst, we're hearing stories of subbies going bankrupt or otherwise going into financial difficulty. In some tragic cases, subcontractors have committed suicide after a number of projects fell over and they didn't get paid for work they had already done.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tradies have the right to be paid for work that they complete on a building site. We have this report. We have ways of making this happen. What we need is the political will. Labor, in its election campaign, committed to implementing the Murray review. I would really like to see this progressed and to see this happen. Tradies cannot continue to be on the end of payments, bearing the brunt of building companies going under. We can't continue to let this happen. We have the solutions; what we need is the political will and the government to get on with implementing the Murray review.</span>

The Fermentation Hub at Legana, in Tasmania's north, was planned as an innovative centre for excellence for the state's flourishing fermentation industry. FermenTasmania was granted $17.5 million by the coalition government's Building Better Regions Fund in 2021, and the hub is expected to open next year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1,800-square-metre facility provides space to test and develop fermented beverages and food; nutraceuticals, which are products derived from foods that have health benefits or medical foods; and green energy on a small scale, with a view to scaling up. With producers and fermentation mentors working together, these new products can be perfected before being launched. This means innovations in wine, cheese, spirits, chocolate, miso, condiments, yoghurt, sourdough and products we haven't even dreamed of yet. These will be researched and developed in Tasmania for a wider market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aspiring fermented-product developers are now submitting expressions of interest to be part of the hub's starter culture. They include applicants from agribusiness, agritourism, education, the food and beverage sector and hospitality. Entry to the hub's starter-culture cohort includes space, access to equipment and expertise, training opportunities, advice on scaling up for commercial production, diversifying product offerings and more. The Fermentation Hub team will also help producers with commercial focused research, with support from industry experts at the University of Tasmania, TasTAFE and the Institute of Brewing and Distilling. I applaud the work that has gone into FermenTasmania's vision for this project, and I look forward to visiting the hub once it's finished.</span>

Kevin Rudd took away their water in the Murray-Darling Basin. Julia Gillard slapped a kneejerk ban on live cattle exports over a heavily biased ABC report about slaughtering practices in another country, thousands of miles from Canberra. Under Greens-Labor climate policies, farmers, energy, fuel and fertiliser costs have all skyrocketed. It's said you shouldn't bite the hand that—quite literally—feeds you, but Labor is doing it all over again with its clear intention to destroy the live sheep export industry in Western Australia. This industry supports thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses along the supply chain and is a mainstay of regional economies. Labor does not have a mandate to destroy sheep farming in this country, but Labor, of course, does not care about jobs in the bush or regional communities and the money sheep farming brings into the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mark my words: this is just the beginning of a strategic attack on all livestock industries in Australia. Unfairly demonising livestock producers as climate polluters, the ultimate aim of Labor and the Greens is to force us all to become vegetarians. Their first step is to ban live exports. Then they will take away the rest of the water needed to irrigate pastures and water stock—we've already seen them abandon dams in Queensland. After that, they will force crippling emissions reduction targets on producers. By then, meat and fresh milk will be in such short supply that most Australians won't be able to afford them. I mention milk because Labor has done nothing about the labour industry and is continuing to put the nail in the coffin of dairy farmers. We won't be able to afford fresh milk; we'll be importing it from New Zealand as powdered milk.</span>

While hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens go out on the streets to protest the undemocratic measures being taken by the new government in relation to the judiciary, the blood spilt in recent weeks in Jenin, Jerusalem, Nablus, Jericho and other places in the West Bank, reaching a peak of mass violence in Hawara, remind us all that there can be no democracy while there is also occupation and inequality. A state that denies rights to millions of people and systemically discriminates against a fifth of its citizens cannot be considered a true democracy. The Israeli military is standing idly by while hundreds of settlers go on a rampage, freely killing and injuring Palestinians, burning down their homes and destroying their property. Only six Israeli settlers have been arrested despite the availability of video evidence of their egregious human rights abuses, and now the Israeli government is turning its police on its own citizens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new changes in Israeli policy must be called out for what they are: the de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory and a subversion of any pretence of Israel's democracy. The Greens always rejected and condemned the promotion of violence, whether perpetrated by a state organisation or individual. While recognising the right of the Palestinian people to resist Israeli occupation in accordance with international law, we also recognise that the rise of far-right extremism in the State of Israel has contributed to an expansion of the occupied territories. The Greens are calling on the Australian government to immediately end all engagement and trade with the Israeli military and be clear in its condemnation of the Israeli— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In October, following the Ministerial Council meeting of Murray Darling ministers, we were told the government would prepare a water recovery strategy for consultation by Christmas. Now that webpage has disappeared and no such consultation paper was produced. Then, a mere 48 hours before the next ministerial council meeting, the government dropped all pretence of consultation and announced open-tender buybacks, under transparency, in six catchment areas, including my own. And then they said that they would consult on the framework and how those open-tender buybacks would be conducted.</span>

Just 48 hours prior to information sessions being held, a handful—only a handful—of stakeholders in my hometown of Deniliquin, where there would be much interest in understanding how this process is going to take place, received email invitations inviting them to register for the information sessions. But you can't register if you weren't a recipient of that email, so a business owner, who might have other things on in 48 hours time, cannot nominate a delegate to attend on their behalf. The sessions have not been publicly advertised on the departmental website, and there's been zero contact with stakeholders. Where is the transparency? Where is the openness?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I rise to speak about the life of Lorraine Bird. Lorraine Bird was a school cleaner and a union member. Her passing, at the age of 69, reminds me of just how much one person who believes in something bigger than herself can achieve when she stands together with people who feel the same. Lorraine was a leader in the campaign for school cleaners to win back good jobs after 4,000 public school cleaners were sacked and then asked to reapply for their jobs, on less money and hours, as contractors. In the years that followed, Victorian schools were awash with wage theft, fly-by-night contractors and dirty classrooms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lorraine and her husband, Ian, also a school cleaner, stood up and spoke out. In the beginning it was Ian who led the charge, but, when he died, Lorraine told me it was her time to step out and speak out. Lorraine was only small in stature, but I can tell you she had a big heart, a big smile and an even bigger voice. Her determination pushed the Victorian government to finally end decades of insecure contracts in 2018, and her legacy lives on in the working lives of thousands of school cleaners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lorraine and Ian epitomised what union really means. It means family—a family of people standing together for the betterment of all—and it means dignity and real respect for hard work. Today I'm thinking of Lorraine's grieving son, her stepchildren, her grandchildren, her great-grandchildren, her wonderful friends and her union family, who were there for her in the end, too. After a life of hard work and inspiring work, Lorraine, rest in peace. You deserve it.</span>

During the 2022 election campaign, Mr Albanese said, 'We've said we have no intention of making any super changes'. Given Labor's track record of proposing higher taxes on retirees at the previous two elections, it is inconceivable that Labor wasn't planning its doubling of the super tax, or something very similar, when Mr Albanese made this promise at the last election. Minister, why is it that Mr Albanese deceived the Australian people before asking them to vote for him?</span>

It gives me the opportunity to remind him and those opposite, and all, that, in fact, the changing of these tax arrangements for a very, very small proportion of Australians will not take effect until 2025, after the next election. It may be that those opposite like to forget about this and like to focus on, as always, their pathology of conflict. But the reality is that what we have inherited is a trillion dollars worth of debt. We have inherited the budget in a position that is unsustainable, and we are making sensible decisions about how to deal with that. They include changing the concessional tax treatment of super balances over $3 million.</span>

That is 30 per cent of income earners—30 per cent. That's one in three income earners affected by the changes you made on super. So let's be clear about the long-term effect of non-indexed changes. Senator Gallagher was up-front yesterday about ours. I don't remember you ever saying, 'Oh, by the way, one in three Australians will be affected by Mr Morrison's changes.' The Australian people are onto you, and they know what you are about, and you're not about average income earners. You're not about families who are struggling to make ends meet. You are all about yourselves, and you're all about politics.</span>

We on this side understand that one of the major pressures on our economy is disrupted supply chains. As the Reserve Bank has said, supply chain issues are responsible for up to two-thirds of inflationary pressures in the economy. To relieve this pressure we need to be a country that can make things here and stand on our own two feet. That is what the National Reconstruction Fund is about. It is a fund that represents one of the biggest ever investments in Australian manufacturing capacity, revitalising Australian manufacturing, creating secure Australian jobs, making things here, investing in new industries like critical industries and seizing opportunities for renewable energy. The National Reconstruction Fund is good for jobs, good for manufacturing and good for the economy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose it makes sense that that is why those opposite would oppose it, because these are the parties that neglected our supply chains and failed Australian workers, but they are very good at saying no, just as they said no last year to providing families and businesses with relief from energy prices. They're more interested in the same old negative politics.</span>

They vote against stuff in here and they don't like to be politically accountable for the things they vote against. I have never seen an opposition actually vote against price relief. Who would have thought? Always negative, always on the attack, even if Australia loses. They said no to the Housing Australia Future Fund. I know those opposite don't like it, but that is additional housing for women and children, including those escaping domestic violence. You are accountable for that decision.

Isn't that interesting? He doesn't want debt associated with a fund that's about investment, but he's happy with debt that's associated with a tax break for people with $3 million in super. There you go. Thank you for being very clear about your political priorities. He's entitled to those views. I don't think they're the views that most Australians share.</span>

Thanks to a decade of neglect and failed policies from the Liberals and Nationals, we do not have the manufacturing capacity to do what we need to do, and we saw that during the COVID pandemic. We couldn't make enough PPE to protect ourselves. Our fund is about building a more resilient, more diversified economy with more jobs in regional Australia so we don't have to rely so much on other countries for some of our critical supplies and to ensure we have the jobs and skills we need for the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

One wonders why they'd be so opposed to revitalising Australian manufacturing and securing our economy. Why don't they support Australian manufacturing? Why is it? Why don't they support economic sovereignty? Why don't they support Australian jobs? We see a coalition that simply wants to say no. We have a plan to address the key challenges facing Australians and the Australian economy—relief, repair, restraint, investment in Australian capacity, investment in Australian jobs. Those opposite have no plan. They left us with a trillion dollars in debt, a massive skills shortage and a hollowed-out manufacturing sector, and now they're standing in the way of the solutions to the very problems they created.</span>

Yesterday, Senator Gallagher, you said to the chamber that the purpose of the government's new doubling of super taxes was to make the super system sustainable. But the <span style="font-style:italic;">Retirement </span><span style="font-style:italic;">income review</span>, published in 2020, said that the evidence indicates that the Australian 'retirement income system is effective, sound and broadly sustainable'. Isn't Labor's doubling of the super tax simply another tax grab to prop up Labor's rampant spending, one that the now Treasurer explicitly promised not to do prior to the election, because he knew Australians would never support it?</span>

We have a trillion dollars of Liberal Party debt that we are managing, that we have to manage. We have pressures coming towards the budget that are increasing, not decreasing, and we can go through them again: aged care, Medicare, hospitals, defence—they are all areas where pressure is increasing, not decreasing.</span>

                  </span>We have a $50 billion structural deficit that we inherited from you. That is what we need to repair, and that is why there is this very modest change to the concessionality of tax for high-balance accounts over $3 million. It's a sensible change. It assists with budget repair. It means that we can make room for some of those pressures that you ignored but Australians value—things like paying for aged-care workers. How about that? We are making investments in those types of areas against a background of a budget that was riddled with waste and pork-barrelling and a failure to deal with the pressures. Remember the 'Back in Black' mugs? We all remember them. That budget was never going back into balance, because there were a range of pressures heading their way, but they also had this very nifty way of budgeting, which was to budget for one year or two years for programs that were ongoing. The dishonesty in your budget when you were in government is galling, and we are fixing it. We take our responsibility seriously and we will get on with it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It affects a very small number of fortunate people who have managed to save more than $3 million in their super. Good on them. Good luck to them.

I'll check if there's further information I can provide. But I will say that in 2016 the changes you brought in affected four per cent of people; in 30 years, they will affect 30 per cent. That's what happens. This is a very modest change. It allows for some budget repair to occur because of the budget that we have inherited. We have spent the last nine months going through the rorts, the waste, the unfunded promises, the legacy funding cliffs, the zombie measures and the billions and billions of dollars buried in that budget that you were not upfront about. We have gone through them. We are making sensible changes to assist with budget repair.</span>

Last month, the RBA said that as much as three-quarters of the increase in inflation is a result of supply shocks, including corporate profiteering; that their models are not well suited to supply shocks; and that there is very little that monetary policy can do to offset supply shocks. We find ourselves today with the RBA responding to a problem it doesn't understand with a solution that doesn't suit. Minister, do you believe that the RBA smashing renters and mortgage holders with interest rate increases in response to inflation driven by supply-side shocks and corporate profiteering is the best economic policy that this country can muster? </span>

I think the bank has a very difficult job to do, and I think the government has a job to work hand in hand with monetary policy. I await the decision of the bank today, but I think the bank have explained that it's a narrow path they are following. They have a difficult job to do. They are independent of government. We have our review of the RBA. Obviously, it's not linked to the tightening cycle. We had announced that review—</span>

                  </a>  Senator Duniam can chuckle, but it's looking at the broader issue that's raised about how fit for purpose the bank is and the fact that it hasn't been reviewed for a period of time—for some 30 years, I think. This review is timely, in the sense that we will get the three panellists' views on whether there need to be changes to any settings, the mandate et cetera. The government was aware of that; obviously it was an election commitment before the last campaign. I think that review will give us the best information available to check, or see how to make sure, that the RBA remains fit for purpose for the job that it has to do. Having said that, I am not linking that in any way to the tightening cycle. We do have an inflation problem in this country. The bank has a very clear mandate to ensure that inflation sits within the two to three per cent band and to ensure full employment. They are following their mandate, and they make their decisions independent of government.</span>

The bank was clear, when those opposite were in government and the rate was sitting at about two per cent and not growing, that it was concerned at that point about wages. I think the comments they've made since, when wages started to lift, is that they would keep an eye on wages. Those are the general comments from the bank. But, again, I think, in terms of the job that they have to do, the risk of persistent high inflation is devastating. It's devastating on people on lower incomes, who will feel the hit from inflation harder than those, I would argue, who are on higher incomes. So let's not pretend there isn't an issue with inflation in this country. There is. We have to manage it, and we have to make sure— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I give him credit for persistence in asking me that question, but my answer remains the same. However, the point you raised on cost of living is real. I think the challenge for those of us looking at the right way to respond and how we need to work hand in hand with the bank on the monetary policy side is: what meaningful difference can we make in a cost-of-living sense that doesn't have an inflationary impact? They are the decisions we've taken around our investment in skills, the National Reconstruction Fund and making investments in housing, cheaper child care and cheaper medicines. All of those are sensible investments. They do come with spending attached, but they are sensible investments which don't put upward pressure on inflation and which assist people with the cost of living. Energy cost relief is another area, and we'll continue to do that.</span>

As we all unfortunately discovered during the pandemic, the goods that Australians assumed would be there when we needed them were not available. Across a range of products, our supermarkets and pharmacies couldn't get what we needed. Who can forget going to supermarkets, with the long lines of empty shelves and the sense of disappointment that we all felt when we couldn't get the products we needed? That was when the seed of the National Reconstruction Fund was planted. After a decade of neglect under the Liberals and the Nationals, it was time to reinvest in our manufacturing capability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that the government is seeking to make the NRF, the National Reconstruction Fund, a reality, it's once again the Liberals and the Nationals that are standing in the way. The government plans are to grow from our strengths—places where we already have natural resources or the human capital to compete with the best in the world. The National Reconstruction Fund will attract investment, it will help grow the Australian economy, and, most importantly, it will deliver high-quality, high-paying jobs for Australian workers.</span>

Sadly, it was the former Liberal-National government that did neglect manufacturing right across Australia. I have seen it firsthand with Holden. It was an unforgivable decision to kick that company out of this country. This is despite the fact that one-third of manufacturing jobs are in regional and remote Australia. Manufacturers are based across regional Australia because of the access to natural resources from minerals to agriculture to forestry and to much more. The NRF is determined to continue that focus on our regions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There they are, right across there. They are the obstacles to the creation of a National Reconstruction Fund. Those opposite are the threats to improving our national self-sufficiency, investing in Australian ideas and turning them into great Australian businesses. Those opposite threaten plans to attract international investment and deliver jobs, many of which will be right in your regional areas. The biggest threat to our plan for a National Reconstruction Fund is those senators sitting across the chamber, the coalition. They say no to investment; they say no to opportunity; they say no to self-sufficiency. The Liberals and the Nationals say no, no, no to Australian jobs in Australian manufacturing.</span>

Can I say the government generally shares your concern, but in particular the minister who has responsibility for this, Minister Collins, is very focused on dealing with this issue. They are all extremely serious issues. Regrettably, at the last census, there were over 116,000 people experiencing homelessness in this country. Of course that is an issue that we must address. It is unacceptable that so many Australians are now forced to couch-surf, sleep rough or live in temporary or overcrowded housing arrangements.</span>

Farming families are frequently cash poor, but they make a living off farmland whose value has tripled on paper over recent years, value that will remain unrealised potentially for decades for intergenerational farming operations. Will farmers that hold such land in self-managed super funds be forced to pay tens of thousands more in taxes under Labor's doubling of the super tax due to nothing more than paper fluctuations in commercial property prices? </span>

As senators in this place would know, under prudential requirements all superannuation funds are required to consider diversification and liquidity when making investments, and, if funds are doing this, they should have some liquid assets to meet any tax liabilities. There are a range of cashflow requirements within an SMSF, not just tax liabilities, which trustees must consider. These include, for example, accounting administration costs, investment fees and the costs associated with maintaining real assets, such as property. For SMSFs with balances in the retirement phase, liquidity is also required for the purpose of meeting pension payments, including on those minimum drawdown requirements. Individuals can also hold their assets in super and elect to pay the tax or any tax liabilities they have by using savings outside of superannuation to avoid paying from their business assets.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have been clear on what this change is about. It is for those with high-balance accounts—over $3 million. We know there are accounts with hundreds of millions of dollars in them. Superannuation is primarily about having a dignified retirement and being able to have savings available to you during your retirement years. What we are doing is making a very modest change to the concessional arrangements that remain concessional for those with balances over $3 million. As to individual superannuation advice, I'm not in a position to give it, but I have made clear—</span>

Minister, cost-of-living pressures are hitting Tasmanians hard. The current average rent is 550 bucks a week, and it is getting worse. The costs of groceries, fuel, energy and everyday living expenses are skyrocketing for Tasmanians. Life is basically getting harder. The waiting list for public housing sits at around 4,500, and that's on a good day. This list is growing and growing and growing. My question is in relation to the Housing Australia Future Fund. When will the detail of the investment mandate finally be released?</span>

As I indicated in my previous answer to Senator Pocock on the issue of housing and homelessness, the government obviously recognises that this is a significant issue. The former government, in almost 10 years, did nothing in this space, and so, of course, we have to make up for 10 years of neglect. We're doing that, Senator Lambie, and, as we speak, there are discussions underway in respect of the fund that you just mentioned. I'm sure, if you would like, I can organise for you to have some discussions with the minister responsible in this area about these issues to get some update on the latest state of play with these issues. But I give you this assurance, Senator Lambie: this government understands that there are problems here, understands that there have been years and years of neglect and understands that we now have the obligation of dealing with this issue, correcting the problems of the past and making sure that we deal with this issue into the future.</span>

The housing industry is not the only area that has labour shortages, as I'm sure you know. Labour shortages are a relic of the inaction of the previous government, particularly in the pandemic era. They sent home lots and lots of people who might have been here to help build some of these houses. One of the significant policies that we took to the last election—of course, Senator Lambie, as you would know—was the fee-free TAFE courses.

My last supplementary question is this: Minister, as my colleague Senator Tyrrell has brought to your attention, Tasmania has an entitlement of 1,200 homes, so why is it that we have the housing minister who represents Tasmania and we're only getting 600 of that? Will the government today, right now, guarantee me that Tasmania will get what it is entitled to and get its 1,200 homes over the next five years?</span>

Well, today, Senator Ciccone, I have good news for Australian farmers, farm workers and all in the agriculture supply chain. Today's latest release of data from ABARES shows that the agriculture industry is well on its way towards its goal of exceeding $100 billion farmgate output by 2030. In the last financial year, the agriculture industry reached the $90 billion mark—an all-time record—and I congratulate every farmer, every processor, every worker and supply chain member for this achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was done off the back of what were, with some exceptions, great seasonal conditions, which have meant record farm cash incomes for broadacre and dairy farms over the past two years. But, of course, the context to this is that input costs for farm businesses are rising, impacting farm profits. Years of failed energy policies and chronic underinvestment in skills development have come home to roost. As a result of this and global factors, agriculture input costs have risen sharply since mid-2021, particularly the price of fertiliser, which has more than doubled, putting intense strain on farming businesses to balance the books. That's why the National Reconstruction Fund is so important. We need a future made in Australia, and that applies to agriculture just as much as every other industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be value-adding, and we should be making more things here. The ability to make things here is vital to not only reduce input costs but also increase the value of the final product that our agriculture industry rolls out. And that's exactly what the National Reconstruction Fund will do, co-investing with industry, including agriculture, to grow our primary industries and turn raw products into even higher-value ones. The Albanese Labor government wants Australia to be a country that makes things again, and we are backing our agricultural manufacturing industry to ensure that that happens.</span>

I'm very pleased to say that the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund—it even has the word 'national' in it—a key election commitment from the Albanese government, has a $500 million portion sectioned out for investment in local manufacturing to support agriculture. Once established, that money will be available to co-invest in more food processing, in bringing down energy costs and more value-adding.</span>

More jobs, more exports, more opportunities and a better bottom line for regional Australia—who wouldn't want that? Unfortunately, quite a few of those members opposite, it seems, are anti manufacturing and anti jobs. Whether it's Mr Dutton or Mr Littleproud, or the Liberals and the Nationals here in the Senate, the coalition only want to say no to this fund. More manufacturing in our regions? No. More value-adding in agriculture? No. More tax concessions for the top 0.5 per cent? Oh, yes!</span>

Prior to the election last year, the now Treasurer said, 'This is a full-blown cost-of-living crisis, a triple whammy of skyrocketing costs of living, falling real wages and rising interest rates.' Yet since the election inflation has skyrocketed to its highest levels in 30 years, wages aren't keeping up, energy prices continue to rise and rise, and, just now, as we all know, the Reserve Bank have announced their ninth rise under this government. Minister, is it correct that under Labor's full-blown cost-of-living crisis an average family with a $750,000 loan taken out prior to May will now be paying $1,470 more per month or $17,688 a year extra on their mortgage?</span>

The senator is correct that the Reserve Bank, at 2.30 today, increased interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.6 per cent. It's the 10th interest rate increase since they began in May 2022, prior to the election, when we entered the tightening cycle because of what was happening with the inflation challenge. I do not accept the proposition put by Senator Cash that this is something that has occurred since the election. It was started before the election. The issues that have led to the tightening cycle, which have been impacted by some of those global factors—which I think we all accept—started before the last election. The cost of living is the real issue facing households. It's good that we've come to it, because the cost-of-living pressures are real on households. That's why the government has been making some difficult decisions around the cabinet table, because of the difficult decisions people are making around their kitchen table. That is why we have energy power bill relief coming in the budget to deal with it—that you opposed! So don't you dare sit here and cry crocodile tears about the cost-of-living crisis—</span>

That is now the offence of this government—that it's putting in place laws that support affordable, sustainable wage increases for the most vulnerable workers. We know you're opposed to it. We just lived through 10 years of your deliberate design feature of your economic architecture being wage stagnation. Investments in the funds are about driving jobs, investment in supply chains and dealing with the housing crisis, and you're opposed to every single one of those measures. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

How could you possibly put that to us when you oppose the billions of dollars we want to flow through the budget to give households energy bill relief? It is staggering those who opposed it in December, and we will make sure that, all the way to the next election, everyone knows that we came to the parliament and said, 'Here's $1½ billion we would like to distribute to households and businesses across Australia to assist with some of the increases in energy prices,' and the 'no-alition' said no. It said: 'You know what? No, you don't deserve it; you don't deserve this cost-of-living relief.' Then you have the hide to come in here and ask about what we're doing about cost-of-living relief on energy bills. Well, thank you very much for that dorothy, Senator Cash. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw in question time today was a Labor Party who have fundamentally failed to understand that they've broken their trust with the Australian people. We've seen them break one promise, and we know they're going to break more promises. If they're going to go after people with $3 million in their super account, what's to stop them going after people with $250,000 in their super account? That is what this is all about. It is about the fundamental breach of trust between a political party elected into office and those who voted for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are forgetting the main principle of super. It's not the Labor Party's money. It's not the government's money. It's not Canberra's money. It's your money. It's money that you've put away. It's money that your employer has put away on your behalf so you can have a safe retirement. Over the last few weeks, the Labor Party, who went to the last election promising one thing, have now swooped in like a bunch of angry magpies, wanting to steal people's money from them. That's what this debate is about. It is about the Labor Party taking your money from you. Before the election, the now Prime Minister specifically ruled out any changes to the super system; that is what the Prime Minister said. Treasurer Chalmers said the same thing: 'There are not going to be any changes to taxes; there will be no tax rises.' But they are doubling the tax on people's super accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasurer Chalmers has inherited an eccentric economic legacy. He is a child of Paul Keating. Treasurer Chalmers did his PhD on Paul Keating, who most famously broke a promise. Before an election, Keating said that tax cuts would be 'l-a-w law' tax cuts, and then he broke that promise. Treasurer Chalmers then went on to great heights and worked for that other great Labor Treasurer, Wayne Swan. He was his deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff. This is the person who is now in charge of Australia's finances. Treasurer Chalmers is the love child of Paul Keating and Wayne Swan. If that doesn't scare you, then the full realisation that Labor are coming after your super accounts should scare you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a Labor minister has said in relation to your super accounts is that it's honey—just think about that. I'm a big fan of Winnie-the-Pooh, and Winnie-the-Pooh is a great fan of honey, but that's Winnie-the-Pooh's honey. How dare the Labor Party treat your money—the money that you've worked so hard for—as their money, their honey, to be given away, to be put where they want it? Leave people's money alone. I don't know anyone who has millions of dollars in their super account, but—guess what—good on them. They've worked so hard for it. It's not as if they won Gold Lotto and went: 'Yippee! I've got $3 million in my bank account.' These people worked for it. What the Labor government is saying to these Australians is, 'We're taking that money off you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What should concern you even more—and I'll repeat myself here because certain people in this building are hard of hearing; they've probably come from the shallow end of the gene pool and don't understand basic economics—is that, if they're going to come for super accounts with $3 million, they're going to come for super accounts with $250,000 or $300,000. Once they break a promise, they'll break other promises. The strongest message that has come out of today's question time is that Labor have no shame whatsoever about breaking promises and they have no shame about taking your money—money that you and your family have worked so hard for. But the mob over there, the mob on the Left side of politics, don't understand that, because they've never had a real job. These are the people who've never worked on a farm or in a business. These people have worked in the Public Service—and by the way, good on people who work in the Public Service, except when you end up on that side, being that bunch of economic vandals who are destroying Australians' retirements.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. I'm getting there; I'm getting there. I was thanking Senator Pocock for advocating for people who really need help from the government—unlike the hill that those opposite are going to die on for the 0.5 per cent of the population who have over $3 million in their super balances. It is an absolute disgrace. This is the hill they want to die on—but sure. There are some sensible questions coming from over here, but over there is absolutely ludicrous. We know what side they've chosen, and it is not the side of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the tax changes they made to superannuation will affect one in three people. It is four per cent of the population now, but they will affect one in three people in 30 years time. But sure: have a crack at us. They don't want to support things that will actually ease cost-of-living pressures for Australians, like cheaper child care, cheaper medicine, skills, housing. They're focused on 0.5 per cent of the population. The people they're advocating for wouldn't necessarily care a whole lot about these things. They don't care about secure jobs. They don't care about Australian manufacturing. They don't care about affordable housing, power bill relief or wage increases for the lowest-paid workers across our economy, or veterans at risk of homelessness, women fleeing family violence or businesses looking for energy security. They don't care about any of these things, but they're advocating so, so hard for 0.5 per cent of the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just Labor who inherited $1 trillion of debt from the absolutely derelict management of the budget. It's the Australian people who inherited that debt. Australian taxpayers are having to pay for the trillion dollars of debt they left them. So I just want to make sure that we understand the problem that we are facing as a country and that Australian taxpayers are having to pay the bill for. It is an absolute neglect of responsibility on their side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's been really clear over the past couple of weeks is whose side they are really on. They're on the side of 17 people who have over $100 million of super. That's whose side they're on—not the side of the average Australian person. And they're on the side of the one person who has $400 million of super. But they want to absolutely try to deny a $1-an-hour wage increase for our lowest-paid workers. One dollar an hour is all those workers were asking for. Those opposite want to absolutely say that that's off the table, but they want to go in hard and die on a hill for people who have over $3 million in super balances. What an absolute disgrace. They want to be on the side of 0.5 per cent of the population. It's worth saying that Labor built super. We will always protect it. We know that those opposite have a whole lot of things that they want to say no to: secure jobs, Australian manufacturing, affordable housing, power bill relief and wage increases. But what they want to say yes to is borrowing billions of dollars to give 0.5 per cent of Australians a tax break.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will give the budget $2 billion in its first year. Those opposite have no solutions, no ideas and no alternatives—just 'no'. Their idea for trying to repair some of the damage done to the budget is to go after some of our most vulnerable Australians. Of course I'm talking about robodebt. Alan Tudge said:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I rise to make some remarks in relation to Senator Gallagher's answers during question time today. The current government made a number of promises before the election about not wanting to touch super. Several statements were made on the record. Further to that, statements were made about not wanting to touch franking credits. This week we've seen legislation introduced to change franking credits, to destroy the franking system, and a new policy to introduce a new tax on super. All of these ideas may have been developed in the Treasury department. The government are facilitating these ideas because they do not want to restrain spending, which is what they should be doing. They're spending $45 billion on off-balance-sheet items, which is fuelling inflation. And we've seen another interest rate rise today, thanks to the Labor Party. The government could also be looking to bank their gains from commodity price increases, but rather than do that they've decided to introduce this new tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far, the government have had two policies on super. The first policy has been to funnel more money to the unions and the second policy has been to put in place a new tax. If they're not locking it up and taxing it, they're locking it up and shipping it off to the union. Those are the two policies the Labor government has on super.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular taxation measure introduces a very novel, very strange concept of unrealised gains. If you're a company, you don't pay tax on revenue and you don't pay tax on sales; you pay tax on profit. You deduct your expenses from your revenue and that is your profit, and you pay tax on that profit. The same thing goes for the super funds today. They pay tax on earnings, which recognises that it's very hard to pay a tax if you haven't actually got some money in your hand to pay the taxman. But the government want to pursue this very strange idea of unrealised gains, which will result in superannuants having to sell lumpy assets in their funds in order to pay the taxman. That is a foreign concept in Australian taxation law. It remains to be seen how that will happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most important point, though, is the judgement call not to index this measure. For the party that say super is their favourite thing, this is the thing that is going to wreck the system, because why would anyone want to put money into a system for 30 or 40 years when they know there's going to be a great big tax at the end of it? If you are 30 years old, you are going to be in the cohort that will have the greatest tax disincentive because of the time value of money. If the measure is not indexed, why on earth would people put money into a super scheme? If I wanted to wreck the system—and I personally think it's a very bad system because it doesn't work very well for workers or for the taxpayer—I would do what the Labor government is doing, which is to not index the scheme. Increasingly, Australians will look at other ways of saving for retirement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great differences between us in this chamber is that we believe in the individual. We believe that Australians are smart enough to make their own judgements. The Labor Party believe in paternalism, and they think people are too stupid to save for themselves, so they have introduced—</span>

                  </a>  I can't hear meself think here! They've introduced the system, and it's very paternalistic. Now I think they're going to kill it with this design feature. Of course, this new tax policy works in tandem with Mr Stephen Jones's initiative to introduce an objective for super, which, of course, the government want to introduce to stop people from taking money out when there is an emergency, like a pandemic, or to pay for a first home deposit, because their only objective here is to keep the money in the fund so that it can be transferred to the union. In the government for vested interests, the only objective is to feather the nest of the rent seekers and the bloodsuckers at the unions and at the super funds. They don't give a rat's about the workers. </span>

This is a modest and meaningful change that has come before the government, which was elected by the Australians as a responsible government to fix up the mess that we were left with, a trillion dollars in debt. And not only that, there was a decade of delay, denial, destruction—that is, triple-Ds on your report card—but debts in the trillions as well. I don't think your parents would be happy.

We have established the National Anti-Corruption Commission, we have got wages moving again after a decade of stagnation that we have experienced, and we hear from those opposite that all of this has been rampant spending—it's rampant spending to take some sense of responsibility and to actually fix the mess?

So many Australians suffered under the scheme. For what? What a perfect summary of their entire time in government: loyalty to themselves and not to the Australian people. You sit here thinking that Australians should listen to you, to your scare campaign, to you neglecting them and putting yourself first. It really is a matter not just for shame but for you to really reflect. I would highly advise that those opposite really reflect on the last decade that they've been in government and what they've done with that time. Maybe take a leaf from our book on what we've achieved in the short time we've been in power.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I'd say to Senator Payman: I've got my own library and I don't need to take a leaf out of anyone else's book. But I did enjoy seeing her having fun making her contribution here today, and I acknowledge her contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two fundamental issues we have in relation to this issue of the superannuation changes. The first is the legitimate expectation of the Australian people that people who are elected in this place, especially if they're from the governing parties, will say before an election what they plan to do and then actually do it and also will say before an election what they're not going to do and then not do it. That's the first issue we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through it chronologically. This is all on the public record. Prime Minister Albanese said on 31 January 2022:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have not planned for any changes on superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barely one year later, promise broken. Our Treasurer, the Hon. Jim Chalmers, member for Rankin, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Look, we've said about superannuation that we would maintain the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Treasurer said that on ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> on 27 March 2022, less than 12 months ago—promise broken. And then our Prime Minister again:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We've said we have no intention to make any super changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's our now Prime Minister, speaking on 2 May 2022—promise broken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the fundamental issue in this debate: broken promises from the now Labor government. They said in opposition that they wouldn't do certain things. They get into government. Less than 12 months later, they do exactly what they promised not to do, and that will quite legitimately shake the Australian people's belief in the integrity of this new government. They have said one thing before an election to get elected and then done the opposite thing after an election. To be frank, it impacts all of us. It impacts all politicians, because we all suffer a bit when someone makes a promise before an election and doesn't carry it through. That's the fundamental problem we have here: the government saying one thing in opposition and doing the opposite when they get elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue we have here is the notion that you should tax unrealised capital gains. I don't know where this concept came from, but it doesn't make any sense. In superannuation, you want to keep your investments stable over the longer term. You shouldn't be forced to sell them in order to meet a tax liability. It doesn't make any sense. I don't know where the government got this advice from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Senator McKenzie asked a very legitimate question of the finance minister with respect to the position of farming families who hold the family farm in a self-managed super fund. It's quite reasonable that tax is paid on the rent that's paid by the individuals to the self-managed super fund which owns the farm. No-one's going to quibble with that. We wouldn't cavil with that at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem under the laws as proposed is that, if the price of the farm fluctuates upwards because of high rainfall, good markets et cetera, it could create a tax liability which would require the liquidation of the farm in order to meet the liability. That is the fundamental issue. And it isn't just me saying this; it is the National Farmers Federation. These are not the words of a politician, but the words of the peak body representing farmers. It said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's peak farming body has warned that superannuation changes announced by Treasurer Jim Chalmers could cool investment in agriculture, unless the detail is worked through with farmers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Yesterday's announcement throws up significant uncertainty for family farms—with scant detail on things like grandfathering, treatment of revaluations, or how this might impact lending in a climate of rising costs and interest rates …"</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not my words. They are not the words of a politician but those of the peak body representing farmers. The farmers in my home state of Queensland deserve to get answers from the Minster for Finance in relation to those questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice I asked today relating to interest rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here to make this speech, the RBA has just raised interest rates again. This is the first time in Australia's history that there have been 10 consecutive interest rate rises. The RBA itself has found that the current inflation spike is being driven primarily by supply-side shocks and corporate profiteering. The RBA itself has admitted that its models are not well suited for supply shocks and also that there is very little that monetary policy can do to offset supply shocks. The RBA said today that the monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked. Yet here we find ourselves, colleagues, with 10 consecutive interest rate rises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA is responding to a problem it admits its models can't understand with a solution that it admits is the wrong tool for the job. This is a form of institutional madness. The central bank is out of control, and it needs to be reined in. This is where the government should act. Specifically, Treasurer Jim Chalmers needs to wake up from his slumber and take action to save the renters and mortgage holders of Australia from being smashed by the RBA's relentless and dogmatic interest rate rises. The Treasurer has the power under the RBA Act currently, and he should exercise that power rather than sit idly by while the RBA risks tanking the economy and smashing renters and mortgage holders. Instead of sitting on his hands, he should intervene in the RBA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What he should also do is introduce a corporate superprofits tax. Let's all be clear about where we find ourselves at the moment. Real wages are declining at the fastest rate on record in Australia. Yet corporate profits are going through the roof. We are through the looking glass here, colleagues. This is the dead end of neoliberal economics. People are starving while the corporations announce mega profits, and the government does nothing about it because it is blinkered by its neoliberal orthodoxy. The opposition is the same. This is where we find ourselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury told the Senate estimates committee that the risk of a wage-price spiral remains low, but here we are with renters and mortgage holders getting smashed by interest rate rises in a circumstance where the RBA itself has found that the majority of the inflation spike is being driven by supply-side shocks and corporate profiteering. The government seems to believe that 10 consecutive interest rate rises smashing people, renters and mortgage holders, into poverty is the right response to a non-existent wage-price spiral.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Figures out today show that the volume in retail sales is in decline. People are buying less because they can't afford to buy stuff. The poorest Australians, those who can least afford to be made worse off, are being left behind while the wealthiest Australians continue to make out like bandits. Yet all the government can do is offer some ashen-faced commentary while people are being smashed into poverty and while the banks, the fossil fuel corporations and the supermarkets announce mega profits. We need to tax corporate superprofits, tax the wealthy, freeze rents, put dental and mental health into Medicare and raise income supports. We could do it all tomorrow if the government would work with the Greens.</span>

But the courageous people of Ukraine can do little with our sorrow, so I also move this notion to demonstrate our government's and our nation's resolve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Olena Zelenska, Ukraine's first lady, has said, we are not commemorating a year of war. We are celebrating a year of resistance, a year of courage, a year of solidarity, and a year of Australia and our partners doing what we can to support the people of Ukraine. We have imposed travel bans and targeted financial sanctions on more than 1,000 individuals and entities in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We've committed more than $500 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including, most recently, $33 million for additional uncrewed aerial systems.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In late January I had the privilege of visiting the training grounds where ADF personnel are training members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as part of a UK-led multinational training program. We do many things in this job which are moving, but that was amongst the most moving of engagements I've had. I was deeply moved by interactions with the new Ukrainian soldiers, who only a year ago were teachers, farmers, professionals and more, now standing ready to fight against Russian aggression. Mr Putin and Russia have underestimated the courage of Ukrainians like these soldiers, and they underestimated the resolve of the global community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in the UN last year, Russia is to be condemned for its illegal and immoral invasion. It should be condemned as an attack on all smaller countries. What it represents, fundamentally, is the assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a smaller neighbour. On 24 February, Australia was one of 141 UN member states that again rejected this assertion—141 countries voted in support of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine; only seven voted against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine has prompted many of us to look back at our history, at the horrors in Europe and Asia that led humanity—that led the global community—to establish the Charter of the United Nations. For many living through those times, it must have seemed that power and lies would succeed. In 1942, George Orwell published his reflections on the competing propaganda that swirled around the Spanish civil war. He saw competing propaganda and lies—what we would now call disinformation. He wrote of his fear that the very concept of objective truth was fading out of the world, but we know now that he was wrong. The truth, at great cost, eventually won out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to Russia and to its apologists and cronies: your crimes and your lies will not stand. In fact, you have only strengthened our collective resolve. You see, we have reflected anew on the type of world order we treasure—the lives lived to potential, the dreams and ambitions fulfilled and the common aspiration around this world that our children prosper in peace and live better lives than our own. Russia has reminded us again that these treasures, important to so many people around this world, are born of a system of rules and order respected by all. One year on, let us commit anew to these rules and laws and, in doing so, commit anew, one year on, to stand with the people of Ukraine.</span>

But Ira is from Mariupol. Ira is one of so many human faces with human stories that have been told as part of the bloody war that has struck Ukraine. Ira has buried her friend's parents, helped her disabled father to flee, seen her mother trapped in Russian territory and lived on stinking mattresses in the basement of her former building. In Ira's words:</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Putin 'liberated' us from our home, from our studies, our work, our future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, in Australia, thousands of kilometres away, care about the war in Ukraine because there are important principles at stake. We condemn the barbaric, illegal and immoral actions of Vladimir Putin and the Russian government he leads. To do otherwise would be to imperil us all by tacitly condoning the actions of violent autocrats. But, amidst our important principles and our strong condemnation, we should remember Ira and the countless other stories of unnecessary loss and suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">UNICEF analysis suggests that 80 per cent of Ukrainian children are now living in poverty. These children are not just facing the obvious physical risks of war from shelling, firing and combat. Such children are not just facing the mental health scars that will stay with them throughout their lives. Their lives and long-term health are imperilled in other ways. The destruction by Russia of more than 800 Ukrainian health facilities means children are missing out on vital vaccines that would otherwise shield them from future disease. Then there are the horrific instances of war crimes committed by Russia. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has identified mass graves, massacres and torture chambers. In one of its reports, the OSCE spoke of the mutilated bodies of murdered men, women and children discovered in a basement. Some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amid such horrors and crimes, it would be easy to be despondent. But, if there is one thing Ukraine has shown itself to be the antithesis of, it is despondency. Ukraine has come to be defined by defiance, stoicism, bravery, resolve and triumph. Putin expected a quick victory, but Vladimir Putin was as wrong in his military strategy as he is in his moral compass. This war was unprovoked, unjust and unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty-one years ago, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, proud Ukrainians rose up and seized their national identity to once again recreate their nation. Using their rights under international law, Ukrainians embraced their sovereignty, celebrated their nationality and built their nation. Although imperfect, like all of us, Ukraine has much to be proud of and much to defend. Ukraine and Ukrainians can be especially proud of their defence of their nation. They and much of the world have been inspired by the acts of courage and bravery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inspirations have come in many forms, most visibly in the leadership of President Zelenskyy. As President Zelenskyy said, Ukrainians made a choice on 24 February last year—not of a white flag but of a blue and yellow flag. He has spoken in defence not only of territory or people but of principles—the right to self-determination, to security and to live without being threatened. These principles form the basis of our call to arms, Australia's call to arms, even from the other side of the world. No small or mid-sized nation should tolerate seeing another invaded by or made subservient to a bigger or more powerful regional neighbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In helping to defend Ukraine, we defend the principles, the norms and the international laws that help to defend Australia. The previous coalition government proudly stepped forward with $225 million of defence military equipment, $65 million in humanitarian assistance, thermal coal to support energy supplies and humanitarian visas for Ukrainians forced to flee. We applied financial sanctions against hundreds of Russian individuals and entities as part of coordinated action with like-minded partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government has built upon this foundation with more support and more sanctions, and our bipartisan support for these actions is emphatic. We will continue to encourage and welcome further actions and encourage further humanitarian assistance for people like Ira and others, as well as encouraging the reopening of Australia's embassy in Kiev.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If democracies have suffered from self-doubt in recent times, the Ukrainian spirit reminds us to have confidence in ourselves, confidence in the enduring nature of our values, confidence to speak truthfully about threats to freedom and confidence to show resolve in confronting evil wherever it lurks. As we acknowledge this first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine we say confidently: Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  On 24 February this year the Ukrainian community throughout not just Australia but the world joined with supporters to commemorate one year since Russia's illegal and immoral full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I was honoured to be invited to speak at the Hobart rally and vigil. We couldn't bring on this motion that day because parliament was not sitting; however, bringing it on today ties in well with this evening's launch of the Australia-Ukraine parliamentary friendship group, which I understand is now the largest friendship group in the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As chair of the group, I would like to thank those members and senators who have joined and to encourage anyone who hasn't joined to join. I would also like to thank Senator Van for serving as deputy chair. I'm looking forward to the launch tonight and to catching up again with the ambassador of Ukraine, His Excellency Vasyl Myroshnychenko, with whom I have developed a great working relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge two members of the Ukrainian community in the gallery here today. There are other members already in the building, off having meetings with various ministers and other people. I thank you for being in the chamber and thank you for coming to the parliament. Please be assured that you have very, very good friends in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me a great sense of pride that Australia is one of the largest non-NATO contributors to Ukraine. We've provided $65 million in emergency humanitarian assistance and over half a billion dollars in military assistance, with our most recent support including sending ADF personnel to the United Kingdom to train Ukrainian soldiers and contributing $33 million in drone technology. Our significant assistance to Ukraine is complemented by actions to impose costs on Russia, including sanctions targeted against more than 1,000 organisations and individuals and import and export sanctions against a number of commodities, including Russian oil, refined petroleum products, coal and gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our assistance to Ukraine has been maintained through the transition from a coalition to a Labor government, and it has continued to have bipartisan support through both. In fact, I understand it has the unanimous support of the parliament—at least I haven't heard any dissent. There is no better demonstration of parliament's support to Ukraine than when both houses gathered for a group photo with the ambassador, in which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition stood shoulder to shoulder with the ambassador. That was a historic moment. The Australian parliament has never done that before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But parliament doesn't stand alone in its support for Ukraine. Our stance is a reflection of the overwhelming support of the Australian public. Australians understand that, even though we are almost on the other side of the world, Australia needs to be in this fight with Ukraine—not just for Ukraine's sake but for our own national interests. Russia's actions threaten the stability of the rules based order that governs international relations. Australians understand that Russia's actions are a threat to every country and the rules based order that maintains global stability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am certain the assistance given to Ukraine and costs imposed on Russia by Australia and our allies have been instrumental in ensuring that Russia's invasion has been a monumental failure, but international solidarity with Ukraine is not the only thing holding Russia back from achieving its objectives. What is also standing in its way is the patriotism, resilience and fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people. I am in no doubt that Russia underestimated the Ukrainian people and that they expected to be in a much better position than they are now. While 24 February marks one year since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it is the culmination of over 30 years of Russia's attacks on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, Russia has interfered in the domestic politics of Ukraine, illegally annexed Crimea and backed separatist militias in the Donbas region—the very militias who were responsible for downing Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, murdering 298 people, including 38 Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of people know that my interest in this conflict, like our nation's, is motivated by an aspiration for global stability and security, but my interest is also very personal. My surname is Ukrainian. I have family ties with Ukraine by marriage, and my husband, Robert, who is of Ukrainian descent, still has a strong connection to his Ukrainian heritage. We are both involved in the Ukrainian community in Tasmania and have been for many, many years. So we see and hear how Ukrainians are suffering, and it affects us deeply. So, given that this is personal, I have the following message for Russian President Vladimir Putin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Putin, the blood that has been spilt—Ukrainian and Russian—in this illegal and unprovoked invasion is on your hands. You have failed to appreciate that Ukrainians are a proud people with their own language, their own culture and their own identity, who have embraced democracy and want to determine their own future. For this reason, your invasion will fail. That is inevitable. The important question for you is how much more blood has to be spilt before that happens. I commend the motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  I would like to thank Senator Bilyk for being chair with me on the Parliamentary Friends of Ukraine since I came into this place in 2019. We have worked very well together on this issue, and I thank her for her hard efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are celebrating the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 24 February 2022, it can't be lost on any of us that this war has been running since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. We have learnt lessons from that, as have the Ukrainian army. We are now seeing a complete rout of the Russian troops. They have effectively lost this war. They have certainly lost the war that they set out to fight, and that is to decapitate the Zelenskyy administration in Kyiv and then go over and take over the country. That is never going to happen. Why isn't it going to happen? Because like-minded nations have stood side by side with Ukraine and given them the arms, material and financial aid that they deserve. They deserve it richly, because, as we've seen, they've fought these fights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen these Russian tactics before, whether in Aleppo in Syria or in Grozny in Chechnya. We've since seen how they fight a war of attrition, in Mariupol and now in Bakhmut. These aren't new tactics for the Russian army, but they are tactics that are bound to fail as long as the West keeps on arming Ukraine and as long as the West keeps on giving Ukraine the weapons they need to fight the war. I've been saying for close to a year that the West needs to supply the main battle tanks and fighter jets. Thankfully, we've seen those main battle tanks promised and some delivered. What we need to do now is convince like-minded countries to send in those fighter jets, which are so desperately needed for air defence and ground strikes, to hit those dug-in trenches where the Russians are hiding away through this winter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As most of you will know, particularly our foreign minister, I visited Ukraine in August last year. It wasn't unauthorised; I was invited by the Ukrainian government. It was an incredibly eye-opening trip. I went for two reasons. The first was to go there—I did a lot of interviews with media there—to tell Ukrainians that we haven't forgotten about them and that even a country as far away as Australia remembers what they're going through and is there to support them. The second was to be able to come home and say to Australians, 'We need to stand with Ukraine.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen the damage that this Russian army has done in Ukraine. It's not pretty. I wouldn't suggest that anyone go there just for sightseeing purposes. I went there and I saw the Bushmasters that we donated, which are being used in this battle incredibly well. I met with the troops that are using them. Sadly, now some of those troops are no longer with us. They've been lost in this war. It reminds me every day that we in Australia, and all our like-minded countries, need to do more. We need to do far more. Yes, we have promised $475 million in military aid. Sadly, not all of that has made its way into the country yet, and I encourage this government to speed up those deliveries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On my first morning in Kyiv, I went for my morning run and I ran past our embassy. We share a building with the Canadian embassy. You can see the Canadian flag flying there. The Australian flag is not there, because our ambassador is not there. The most important thing I learnt while I was there was the resilience of the Ukrainian people. Every person I met was waiting to be called up. Whether they were a taxi driver or a barista making a coffee—anyone you met in the street—everyone was saying: 'I'm up for this fight, and I'm dying to go.' Every person I spoke to—and, I think, every person in that country—will fight to defeat Russia. We need to be doing our bit to support them, and we must.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  War is a most terrible thing. Those so-called leaders who would pursue wars of aggression, to dominate, to subjugate and to profit from their neighbours for political purposes are committing, in that act, one of the highest legal and moral crimes possible in the human community. In their illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and his regime have joined a dark pantheon of despots, dictators and sometimes democratically elected officials who have committed such vile crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking to this motion today, I once again extend the solidarity of the Australian Greens movement to the people of Ukraine in their struggle to retain and reassert their sovereignty and to face down this vicious dictator and his brutal regime. In doing so, I also reiterate the calls of the Australian Greens for all nations that are party to the United Nations Charter to work collectively in accordance with the Uniting for Peace resolution, No. 377 A, to deliver coordinated international support to the people of Ukraine. It is absolutely incumbent upon Australia to work as part of the international community to ensure that the words of solidarity that are so often and so easily spoken in political chambers throughout the world are translated into material action. One of the ways in which those words must be translated into that material action is to now begin organising an international program of debt relief for Ukraine to support them in the urgent work that will need to be done for the rebuilding of their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, as we sit here, the Ukrainian army is engaged in a great battle with Russian forces over the city of Bakhmut. Much has been said in relation to the military strategic value of this engagement and this location. But we must not forget that this is a town which before the war hosted 70,000 people. Seventy thousand people called Bakhmut home, and it is now little more than rubble. Should the Ukrainian army and their allies achieve their strategic objectives, should tomorrow the Russian forces be thrown back over the border, should Crimea be liberated, the very next day the residents of Bakhmut will have no more home to return to than they do right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a profound moment of danger for the people of Ukraine in that moment if, in the aftermath of victory on the field, the international community declares 'mission accomplished' and moves on. We cannot let that happen. We must ensure that the Ukrainian government are provided with that plan of debt relief so that they can invest in the rebuilding of their communities and the reknitting together of those communities, to be able to once again have the services and supports that people need to ensure that a state is able to function in a time of peace, and to do more than simply deliver ammunition, materiel and troops to a battlefront. If we fail in that moment—if we turn away and say, 'You've got your battle tanks, but it's a very hard conversation for us to have with the IMF or the ECB or global moneylenders in relation to your national debt'—then in that moment we will condemn Ukraine to struggle to re-establish itself as a sovereign nation and a functioning, peaceful nation. We will continue this work. We will continue to advocate alongside the Ukrainian community for these actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

This illegal, unprovoked and unjust conflict has resulted in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians at the hands of Russian forces, according to the UNHCR, with more than 7,000 civilians killed and 11,000 injured, including 177 girls and 221 young boys. The UNHCR reported in September last year that 12.3 million people had fled the Ukraine, while seven million had been displaced internally. That's 19 million Ukrainians that have left their homes. Many thousands more have been forcibly deported to Russia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historic cities that have taken hundreds of years to build now lie in ruins. Ukraine estimates that Russia has caused US$1 trillion worth of damage since the start of the full-scale invasion last February, and that it is not even allowing for the costs in Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were invaded in 2014. The Ukraine government has estimated that 150,000 residential buildings, 1,500 schools and 20,000 kilometres of roads have been destroyed. And Russia, in its indiscriminate attacks, has targeted hospitals, schools and energy supplies. Russia's blockade of the Black Sea ports is equal to economic blackmail, with some of the world's poorest people now paying higher prices for food, energy and the very means to survive. In the areas liberated from Russian forces, Ukrainians have uncovered mass graves as well as evidence of rape and torture on an unimaginable scale.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is President Putin who is responsible for this. He could stop it at once by withdrawing his forces from Ukrainian land, but he continues with his delusions of imperial grandeur and expansion. He blundered into a war that he cannot and will not win. Ukrainians were always going to resist a hostile attack aimed at wiping out their country. Russia was warned that if it instigated the conflict Ukrainians would defend their homeland ferociously, and they have. Today, Ukrainians are more unified, proud and determined than ever, and the overreach of Russia has united the world in the common purpose of peace and to defend the principles of the UN Charter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians remain united and resolute in our support for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Today, to be in the chamber and to hear the Labor government, the Liberal and National parties in coalition, the Greens and the Independent senators stand as one, united in our support for Ukraine, is a demonstration of what is occurring. This is a microcosm of what's occurred, particularly in Western democracies around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, as a nation, are doing our part in helping Ukraine fight this illegal war and abate the global economic impacts Russia has caused. It is the former coalition government that stood with Ukraine 12 months ago, offering substantial humanitarian, economic and social support, and that has been continued by today's Labor government, and we thank them for that. We played a major role in food supply and fuel for Europe and the wider economic community. We've donated 70,000 tons of thermal coal to support Ukraine's energy security. We've banned the import of Russian oil, petroleum, coal and gas, banned the export of alumina, bauxite and luxury goods to Russia, and introduced an additional tariff of 35 per cent on imports from Russia and Belarus. We will continue to provide bipartisan support to the Australian government to ensure we provide more military and humanitarian assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our former coalition government committed $285 million of defence military assistance, including 40 Bushmasters from my home state in Victoria, produced in Bendigo, and $65 million of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine's fight for freedom. I'm proud to say that Bendigo Bushmasters have played a central role in Australia's military assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a David and Goliath battle. As a middle power in the global order, Australia stood strong at the start, and I think it was particularly due to our efforts at the beginning of this war—I don't think it was an assured assumption that everyone was going to come to the table 12 months ago— that we stand as united as the Western democracies in particular have been against the aggression of this illegal war. So, practically and philosophically, this nation stands with Ukraine. We stand for peace, but it's not peace at any price. The sovereignty of this nation matters, and we won't stop supporting them until they can be sovereign again and Vladimir Putin and the Russian forces are behind their own borders.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I thank the Senate for this opportunity and I thank my fellow senators for their contributions. We've watched on for over a year now at the horrors of the war in Ukraine, a country being invaded, a people fighting bravely and against all odds for their families and for their country. The world has rightly grappled with what to do with such an immoral, illegal and unjust invasion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we can learn much from the words of a moral giant, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor who grappled with this question in the face of Hitler and what to do in that situation. He left some wisdom for us: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The global community has made clear the condemnation of Putin's actions. We must call for an end to this war and we must call for peace. We must stand alongside the Ukrainian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really proud to represent so many people here in the ACT who have been protesting, fundraising and looking after Ukrainian refugees. Many of them have put their lives on hold to focus on this. I'd really like to take this opportunity to read out some of the words of a few of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is Canberran Marusya Jacyshyn. She said: 'My parents were forced to leave their beloved homeland, Ukraine, due to the twin horrors of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. They were never to return to their families. Our family arrived in Australia in July 1949. Australia provided a safe haven and hope to rebuild their shattered lies. My late parents worked tirelessly for Ukraine's freedom, sovereignty and independence. This was passed on to their children and grandchildren. The Ukrainian community in the Canberra region, with their loyal friends and supporters from many countries of origin, have protested for over 12 months, every Saturday, outside the Russian embassy—not just in support of Ukraine's fight for self-determination, freedom and democracy but for that of the free world. I urge the Australian parliament to continue to provide bipartisan support for Ukraine with humanitarian aid, military aid and economic aid. This full-scale war waged on Ukraine by the Russian Federation impacts on all of us. Thank you, Australia. Slava Ukraini.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next one is from Andrew Liszczynsky. He said: 'We're 12 months into this war, Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine, and the Ukrainian community here is still outraged about the invasion. Ukraine is a sovereign nation and is grimly defending that sovereignty. The Ukrainian community here and all over Australia, and the rest of the world, continue to protest this Russian aggression and will continue to do so whilst Russian forces are in Ukraine. Let's make no mistake, Putin is trying to destroy everything Ukrainian—identity, language, culture, religion and cultural icons. But he will not win, because Ukraine, led by President Zelenskyy, is strong in its resolve. Ukraine is determined to defend all things Ukrainian, and the world is showing massive support because this is simply wrong. Putin will lose and Ukraine will prevail.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I have a contribution from Dimitri Kun. He said: 'Thank you, Australia, for supporting Ukraine. We must continue the support. Russia's disregard for international norms and laws must be stopped by Ukrainians now or else we may find that other dictators, inspired by Putin, start territorial conflicts and wars. That is not a good prospect. We stand with Ukraine and we call for an end to this war. Slava Ukraini.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, this is an issue that we need to continue to speak up about. I thank the major parties for their support of Ukraine, at this time, and the many thousands of Australian people who, in their own way, have protested or shown their support to people in Ukraine. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300134" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CADELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  On 24 February 2022, after months of Western intelligence agency warnings and Russian denials, the armed forces of Russia invaded the land of Ukraine. We saw on TV live pictures of helicopter landings in Hostomel Airport, armoured columns advancing on suburbs and cities and the Ukrainian population filling bottles to make Molotov cocktails, sending children away from their homes and arming themselves in response. In what was meant to be a three-day easy victory, as we heard, we are now on day 377, and Russia retains control of a very small portion of Ukrainian sovereign territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen war crimes. We have seen targeting of civilians. We have seen and been reminded of the horrors of war over and over again, in Bucha, in Mariupol and now in Bakhmut. Even overnight there was a video of a Ukrainian prisoner of war being executed on camera. His last words were, 'Glory to Ukraine.' But we have also seen the best of humanity, people coming together in unity of purpose, helping each other, protecting their country, their way of life, working to survive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the globe there has been humanitarian military aid in response to the needs of Ukrainians and their government. Just hours after the invasion, President Zelenskyy was quoted as saying: 'The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride.' The world has heard that, and it has answered. The people of Ukraine, inspired by its armed forces and political leadership, turned the tables and drove the invaders completely out of western Ukraine, with the famous tractor corps of Ukraine claiming hundreds of pieces of military equipment that could be repaired and then reused against the invaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is not fuelling Ukraine's ability to fight. Ukraine's ability to fight is fuelling the world's appetite to stand up for what is right and what is wrong. I searched for better words than those of the German foreign minister, but I couldn't find them. She said: 'If Russia stops fighting, the war stops. If Ukraine stops fighting, there is no more Ukraine. It is that simple.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not going to be a defeat of Russia. It is a defeat of decency, it is a defeat of diplomacy and it is a defeat of humanity. We must do better. Russia has a right to its own security and to feel safe within its own borders. It does not, however, have any right to act with such hostility across and within the borders of another sovereign country. That is not the way to achieve this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Russia I say: tell the world what security you need to pull all of your forces and all of your arms back to the borders of '91. What can the world do to stop sending the sons of the Rodina to their deaths? What can the world do to halt your illegal, immoral and corrupt slaughter of the innocent and the destruction of such beautiful, historical and productive lands? It's not just the future of Ukraine you hold in your hands; it is the future potential of Russia. No-one wants to see a generation of young men taken away from their families, their homes and their jobs. These men that Russia is sending to their slaughter deserve so much better than that. The Stalinist phrase 'quantity has a quality all of its own' should not be measured in body bags.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This war must end because no-one will win it. The war must end with guaranteed safety of Ukraine and Russia within their own borders, and in Australia we've done our bit. We have sent our aid, we have sent our arms, we are sending our training and we have sent our love and support to Ukraine. Respected independent open source intelligence like Oryx has observed the loss of six of our Bushmasters and three of our M113 APCs. It is likely that more has been lost, but we have seen these put to action and the crime is that people have died while they were in them. We must continue to seek opportunities to assist the Ukrainians, we must continue to seek opportunities to support peace and when all of this madness ends we must seek opportunities to support reconstruction and reconciliation, for the absence of armed conflict does not in itself represent peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> But the war rages on. People are dying today, they will die tomorrow and the risk is we will all become so used to it that we become desensitised to it, we stop caring and we stop helping. I say to Ukraine: I will not stop caring, Australia will not stop helping. We must do whatever it takes to deliver peace to your country and your people, and please, until that day, stay safe, fight hard, and we salute you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 February 2023, I attended a rally in King George Square in my home state of Brisbane. In that place, the Ukrainian spirit was there for all to see and feel. It was there in King George Square: the spirit of freedom, democracy, sovereignty—a spirit that has survived the horrors of the Stalinist Soviet Union, which survived World War II and which now, against all odds, is surviving.</span>

There were representatives from our wonderful Vietnamese community, our African community and our Indian community. The very, very best of Australia was in that square in Brisbane on Saturday 25 February 2023.</span>

Cameron Dick was there, representing the state Labor government. David Crisafulli MP, the state opposition leader, was there. The Deputy Mayor of Brisbane was there. There was a unity of purpose in that square on that day. It was the very, very best of Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians elected the 47th Parliament with a mandate for real and ambitious climate action. The government may have their mandate of 43 per cent, but there are many MPs and senators with a mandate for action more in line with the science. Scientists have spent decades telling us that we need to act now to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change—effects that we are already seeing and that communities across the country are experiencing. The costs are mounting. We're seeing natural disaster after natural disaster, but we're not seeing the kind of action from politicians that we need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safeguard mechanism presents an opportunity for us to show the children who come through here and watch Senate proceedings, children across the country and children who have taken the government to court to say, 'You have a duty of care to look after us.' And we've seen the Australian government challenge that, and say, 'We don't have a duty of care to young people and to future generations.' We have an opportunity, with the safeguard mechanism, to begin to bring our climate action in line with the science. The safeguard mechanism has to work. It has to actually reduce emissions, and this means ensuring that emissions reductions are real and not just on paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the proposed reform, Australia will join Kazakhstan as one of only two countries in the world that allow unfettered access to offsets, and it's obviously no good. There is a huge amount of evidence and agreement on the need for an emissions reduction hierarchy. Companies must first avoid and then reduce their own emissions. Offsets can only be used as a last resort. To quote the former Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Offsets can't be a device which big emitters use not to change their behaviour, not to do something about reducing emissions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no doubt that coalition senators will stand up and speak about how the safeguard mechanism will put industries at risk and push up prices. What they're missing is the opportunity for industry in a low-carbon economy. What they are missing is the moral obligation to act on the biggest challenge humans have ever faced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're blessed with an incredible wealth of resources in this country. We hear a lot about resources, and resources will be a big part of our future, but not fossil fuel resources. We need to focus on the resources of the future and stop allowing politicians to conflate the two and present people who want a livable future and a transition away from fossil fuels as people who are against resources. Our major trading partners are decarbonising and starting to give preferential treatment to low-carbon imports. That is a massive opportunity for Australia, with our incredible mineral wealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the government, we will likely hear that finally something is being done and put in place for real climate policy. But we don't have time for incremental changes. We can't just say we're heading in the right direction. The fires and floods of the last few years should be a wake-up call for all of us. We owe it to those communities. We owe it to Australians. We owe it to Australians who haven't been born yet to deal with this now, and we have an opportunity with this legislation. We will likely hear that a hierarchy of mitigation is assumed in the legislation, but there is nothing explicit to ensure that we are avoiding emissions, reducing emissions and then, as a last resort, using the land sector to offset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend this to the Senate. This is a really important policy, but we have to get it right and we have to ensure that it reduces emissions in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I thank Senator Pocock for the opportunity to speak on his urgency motion relating to the safeguard mechanism reform, which of course is a live issue in this parliament and something that there's been much deliberation upon. I note that, in the matter of urgency that Senator Pocock put before the chamber, he references global warming and keeping it to 1.5 degrees and goes on to talk about the design needing to be based on an emissions reduction hierarchy—which we've just heard him speak about—that delivers genuine emissions reductions while also ensuring a future for essential industries. I think it's important to focus on a couple of points in that as I provide a response from the coalition on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of climate change is, as this motion points out, a global one. It's one where there is a global responsibility. So it is right for us to do what we can here in this country. I think it is imperative that a country that can should show responsibility and do what it can to minimise its impact on the environment, including when it comes to carbon emissions. But the problem with the matter we're dealing with, when it comes to the safeguard mechanism that is the subject of consideration here, is that there is a difference of opinion in this place about exactly how best, under what is being proposed, we can achieve what we seek to achieve: minimising human impact on the environment and, in this case, minimising carbon emissions, without having an undue and damaging impact on the economy. It's something I've talked about a couple of times here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For what it's worth, the coalition's view is that the proposal that is referenced in broad terms in the motion is one whose environmental impact we haven't seen properly assessed. We actually don't know what impact it will have on emissions reduction. There are some projections. We've just dealt with a motion on some of the modelling that the government refuses to reveal to us. We don't know what the impact will be—what reliance on carbon credits. Similarly, we don't know what impact such a proposition will have on the economy. It is something we've flagged as needing more serious consideration and more thought put into it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of Senator Pocock's matter of urgency, particularly at the tail end—'delivering genuine emissions reductions while also ensuring a future for essential industries'—is, I think, absolutely important. Part of the concern the coalition has about what is currently before us is the idea that we will see industries that cannot meet the emission reductions mandated under this legislation and under matching regulation and that cannot access carbon credits, either through the safeguard mechanism credits or through ACCUs, faced with this increased cost of doing business here. Despite promises that there will be a scheme whereby these trade exposed industries like cement manufacturing and aluminium production, will be protected through a formula, we're not convinced that that is the case. The proposal doesn't ensure a future for essential industries, and that is as important as making sure we get right what we need to when it comes to reducing emissions. If we don't get both of those things right, then we're failing on both counts, and no-one is better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, when you don't protect these trade exposed industries and try to bring them on the journey with you—try to work with them to invest in innovation and technology and to work with academic and educational institutions to provide better technology to minimise the impact on the environment—then those businesses, because of this penalty of $275 per tonne of carbon above the baseline, will either reduce production here, in the best case, or simply shut up shop and go offshore. Then those emissions, which we could otherwise be working with them to minimise, will be generated offshore, somewhere else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to that original point: it's a global responsibility; it's a global problem. We can't simply offshore our problems and make someone else try to deal with them, because we will still have the issues Senator Pocock talked about before. That's why it is right to expect the information needed to understand the government's proposal and to ensure that we're getting it right in what we're putting in place to reduce emissions but also to minimise the impact on the environment for our future generations.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Thank you, Senator Pocock, for bringing forward this afternoon's urgency debate. Action on safeguards is urgent. That is something we can both agree on. It is exactly why the government has legislation before the parliament right now that alters the safeguard mechanism so that facilities covered by the mechanism must reduce their direct emissions in the future. We can also agree, I think, that reforms to the safeguard mechanism must ensure that Australia's biggest emitters do their fair share when it comes to emissions reduction. On that basis, we're happy to support the motion and have this conversation here in the Senate. But we think it is important to be clear about the safeguard mechanism reforms that we propose and what we are doing, because we don't agree with the whole of the senator's contention in the motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is unapologetically focused on transforming Australia's domestic economy to a low-carbon economy. It is the most important thing we can do to support the ambitious international action that is necessary to contain global warming to 1½ degrees. It's why one of our first acts in government was to legislate an ambitious but achievable emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030—a floor, not a ceiling—and our safeguard reforms have been carefully designed to support that and to support Australia's biggest emitters to remain competitive in a decarbonising global economy whilst reducing their emissions. A fit-for-purpose safeguard mechanism does provide the policy certainty for businesses to invest in decarbonisation and seize the opportunities from global energy transformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mechanism we propose will progressively lower baselines, consistent with our legislated target. We estimate it will deliver 205 million tonnes of abatement by 2030. With respect to Senator Pocock, this is not trivial and this is not, as characterised, incremental. These reforms are significant, and they are designed so that all facilities, whether they are existing or new, reduce their emissions. The proposal creates strong incentives for facilities to reduce those emissions on site and for the industrial sector to decarbonise. Of course, facilities who may reduce emissions below their baseline will have the opportunity to create and sell safeguard mechanism credits. It is part of arrangements for flexibility that secure both our economic capacity and our emissions reduction. We want to ensure not only that these facilities meet their obligations but also that they can grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many safeguard facilities are in hard-to-abate sectors, like cement and steel, where technologies have not yet been demonstrated or aren't yet commercially available. The access to flexible options is incredibly important for these sectors. ACCUs are part of this. The land sector is part of this. An ACCU represents a tonne of emissions avoided or sequestered. We are strengthening confidence in that scheme to ensure the continued integrity of that abatement. We've done that through the Chubb recommendations, which found that the scheme is sound. Of course, Professor Chubb made recommendations for reform, and we're committed to implementing those. But let's be real about this. These ACCUs contribute to our legislated targets, and they are not a free pass. Facilities that choose to use ACCUs will have to buy them on the open market, and many businesses will choose to permanently reduce emissions in their own facilities on site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as indicated just now and in recent weeks, those opposite have made themselves irrelevant to this process by opposing a policy that they themselves proposed to implement when they were last in government. The former government had grand plans for safeguard crediting. In fact, it was their policy right up to election day, included in their election document 'Our Plan for Resources'. Yet here we are, with coalition senators repeating the same old lines. After a decade of delay, denial and dysfunction, all that there is on offer is half-baked scare campaigns that are made up from the same old talking points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, for the first time in a decade, we have a parliament comprising members and senators who are willing to deliver what the Australian people have been crying out for for a decade: action on climate. They called for action loudly at the election, and now they have a government that is willing to deliver. But we cannot do this on our own. We require a majority in this place, and, when the legislation comes before senators, it will be a choice of real significance. We can seize or squander the only chance before us to get down emissions from our largest industrial emitters. I thank senators for their constructive engagement with Minister Bowen and with the government, and I look forward to the debate proper when it commences in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Gr</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">eens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  To have any chance of getting the climate crisis under control and meeting even this government's weak emissions target, there can be no new coal and gas projects—not one. The inquiry into Labor's safeguard mechanism heard from expert scientists and economists. The conclusion was clear: under the safeguard mechanism as it is currently proposed, actual pollution from coal and gas goes up. We're not talking about incremental progress that the Greens just don't think goes far enough; we are talking about a flawed scheme that will actually make the climate crisis worse. Surely the measure of a good climate policy is whether it makes pollution go down. On that measure alone, the safeguard mechanism fails to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the inquiry, the government was asked repeatedly to show evidence that the safeguard mechanism would bring down pollution from coal and gas. They made no such commitment. The department offered no evidence. Their own projections confirm that emissions from gas will increase. The emissions from the first five years of the Scarborough gas project alone will wipe out the entire claimed benefit of the safeguard mechanism. It is difficult to have any confidence that the scheme will do anything to curb business-as-usual behaviour from coal and gas companies. It's no wonder that it has the support of Woodside, of Shell, of Rio Tinto and of Origin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safeguard mechanism targets only scope 1 emissions, and only 4.9 per cent of coal and gas entities covered by the scheme will face a price signal. Any cost impacts imposed on this fraction of a fraction of overall emissions can be completely offset, with facilities able to buy their way out of the scheme at a very low price for a very long time. Already-contracted ACCUs—Australian carbon credit units—account for nearly 70 per cent of the total abatement goal. So not only can coal and gas pollution continue to rise as long as enough offsets are bought but also more than two-thirds of the modest ambitions of this scheme will have been achieved without a single dollar of new investment. Lax exit arrangement for government contracts will see 84 million land based offsets from the Mr Angus Taylor era flooding the private market, to be scooped up by coal and gas companies that are planning new projects. This could push out exposed industries that actually need assistance to abate their emissions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want genuine Australian industry and manufacturing to thrive. Aluminium, steel, bricks, fertilisers, glass and cement all have a future in the clean economy, but coal and gas don't. We should be supporting genuine Australian industry to transition, not asking them to make room in a finite carbon budget for more coal and gas. We must limit the use of offsets and ensure that offsets have integrity. The scheme allows entities to keep going on, as long as they buy enough dodgy offsets. It's a clever accounting trick, but it won't fool the planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have made an offer to support the safeguard bill if the government commits to no new coal and gas. But we've also said that we're open to other ways of achieving that end, including through a climate trigger. This nation has squandered the last critical decade for climate action under a climate-denying government. We need this government to design a scheme that makes pollution from coal and gas go down, not up.</span>

However, we do not support all of the substance of Senator Pocock's motion. Let me be clear. The Albanese government does agree that action on safeguards is urgent.

The safeguard legislation will be a test for senators in this place. For the first time in a decade we have a parliament of senators and members who are willing to deliver what the Australian people have been crying out for: real action on climate. At the last election, Australians voted for an end to the division, the climate wars that have plagued government policy for a decade.

So I ask Senator Pocock and other senators: what will you do when the safeguard legislation comes before the Senate? There is going to be a clear choice that will need to be made. Senator Pocock can join with the government and take decisive action to get emissions down, to take 205 million tonnes of emissions out of the system to 2030—the equivalent of taking two-thirds of Australian cars off the road—or it can choose to join the obstructors. And let's be clear. They have been obstructing action on climate change in this chamber for decades, both in government and in opposition. That is their record. He can sit alongside the climate wreckers and climate deniers on the opposition benches and block action on climate. That is the choice senators will be facing. We know what happened when the Greens faced that same choice in 2009 and 2010. Instead of voting for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, they sat with the Liberals and Nationals of Tony Abbott and blocked climate action. The reality is that their choice derailed climate action for a decade. I say to Senator Pocock and other senators thinking of standing in the way of safeguards: do not let history repeat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are good-faith discussions happening between the government, the Greens and other senators, including Senator Pocock. I thank these senators for their engagement, which stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who, under the Leader of the Opposition, are determined to oppose everything and take no responsibility for cleaning up the mess that they created. The Albanese government will continue to work constructively with those who are willing to be constructive and important partners on this task as we look to reduce emissions. But this is an opportunity too important and too urgent to miss. That's why we agree that this is a matter of urgency today, and we will be acting on this issue as a matter of urgency in coming weeks. But if Senator Pocock really believes this is a matter of urgency and wants to keep faith with the people of the Australian Capital Territory, who have been national leaders when it comes to climate action, he will back our legislation when it comes to the Senate later this month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, I was with Minister Bowen in Gladstone when he announced our proposals around the safeguard mechanism. The important point about that is that we want to work with industry to ensure that they can lower their emissions, because a lot of these industries are very important not only to our national supply chains but to the task that we face in rebuilding manufacturing in this country. Unlike the Greens, who operate in a silo on these issues, we know how important it is to work constructively with industry, who want to bring down their emissions, and we want to provide the government leadership to enable that to happen. That's what we want to do through the safeguard mechanisms. That's what Minister Bowen announced when we were in Gladstone in January. That's what the government intends to deliver on over the coming weeks in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on all senators to engage in constructive discussion to ensure that we can pass this safeguard mechanism, because it is of vital importance for Australia's future. It also of vital importance for Australia's industries that they can continue to operate and deliver the employment that so many regional families rely on. That's what we want to deliver.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  The northern jarrah forests of my home state of Western Australia are some of the most beautiful, diverse and vulnerable forests on planet Earth. The preservation of these forests and their continued contribution to action on climate change is paramount. They have indeed been identified as an ecosystem of particular risk due to the increasingly drying climate, which is a reality of climate change. It is places like this that I want to see protected. It is places like this and the contribution that they make to our planet and our community that call on us, among so many other things, to pass climate laws which take on corporations and actually tackle the climate crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Corporations such as Alcoa have gotten away with far too much for far too long. Not only have they been clearing our forests; just last month it was revealed that they have built a pipeline carrying toxic waste across Western Australia, right over the top of a key water supply dam. Toxic waste is flying over the top of a drinking water reserve! This toxic waste contains forever chemicals, known to cause serious adverse health issues, including cancer and impacts on reproductive health. This wasn't an unforeseen accident. This wasn't an unfortunate whoopsie. Alcoa made an application to build this pipeline. The application was under assessment, and Alcoa went ahead and built the thing anyway. You'd rightfully assume that such wilful disregard for human health and the law would result in harsh penalties. Significant fines and criminal charges strike me as appropriate. So what happened? Alcoa was forced to purge the pipeline and—nothing. That's it. That's all they were required to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, again, not something that went unforeseen. Alcoa knew that this was exactly how it would play out, just as Rio Tinto knew when they misplaced a radioactive capsule somewhere in the Pilbara, and the worst they faced was a $1,000 fine. In WA, mining companies know that it is better for business to ask forgiveness than permission. These corporations must be held to account, via climate laws, for their impact on the climate crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  It was good to hear Labor senators today acknowledge that millions of Australians—after more than a decade of climate inaction in this place—voted to get climate action in this parliament. Isn't it ironic that the first piece of legislation we have before us in this parliament is an ex-Tony Abbott piece of legislation? Soon we are going to debate whether you can polish a turd. But let me tell you, right here and now: the only things this legislation will safeguard are the profits of big polluting companies and the cosy relationship between the Labor political party and the Liberal political party and their big fossil fuel donors. It won't safeguard the children who are here in the chamber today, watching this debate, and their futures. It won't safeguard our climate or our environment or our communities that are suffering and have been in parliament this week urging us not to pass this safeguard mechanism as it is. You can't fix a problem by making it worse.</span>

Some of us have been in this chamber day in, day out for over a decade, trying to get climate action. I thank Senator David Pocock for bringing this debate here today.</span>

We were very proud of that. I'm not sure why you and the Labor political party keep writing her out of the history books, going back to 2009. The world's changed since 2009. In case you haven't noticed, the physical world is changing. The Barrier Reef is bleaching. </span>

                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  While some might say the government is still in its honeymoon period, it has broken more promises than any newlywed in history. It's been only 10 months since the election, and I have a list of 10 broken promises from this government, one for each month in government. They're not little promises, either; they're not small ones, but they were all sweet nothings that the Labor Party whispered to the Australian people over a year ago, during the election campaign, to reassure them that it would deliver for them. Instead, the Australian people have been completely dudded and these promises have been completely broken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the top of the list is the oft-repeated promise to cut people's power bills by $275 a year. In fact, the now Prime Minister made that promise 97 times before the election. Ninety-seven times Anthony Albanese said to the Australian people that he would cut power bills by $275. Guess how many times he's repeated that promise since the election: zero, nada, zilch. He doesn't mention it anymore. It was a sweet nothing said before the Australian people walked down the aisle with the Australian Labor Party. Once the vows were said and the ring was on the finger, he completely forgot about it, as if he'd never said it before. Anyone who's opened up a power bill in recent months knows that they certainly haven't gone down by $275. My power bill hasn't. It's skyrocketed up, in the opposite direction, and now the Labor Party won't even give an inch of support to the fact that they made this promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party also said there will be no changes to superannuation. The Prime Minister said that on radio many times. He said he had no plans. He said on 31 January last year, 'We have not planned for changes on superannuation.' In the last two weeks we've seen a doubling of superannuation tax rates for—we now know, thanks only to the Senate yesterday—10 per cent of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The now Prime Minister also said that he would increase real wages for the Australian people. In fact, a couple of weeks ago it was confirmed that we've had the biggest reduction in real wages in recorded history—another broken promise from this Prime Minister. We had a promise that there would be no increase in the tax burden. As I said, that has already been breached by the superannuation promise. We've also had the Treasurer out there in the last couple of weeks saying that he might tax the family home, too. He hasn't ruled that out of contention.</span>

                  </a>  Who knows? Who could trust what you say here today, when you're definitely not keeping up with what you said last year?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party also promised that people's franking credits wouldn't be touched. Remember that? They wouldn't be touched. We learnt this week that they're back on the agenda to be taxed. When the Australian people elected the Labor Party last year, they thought they were getting Anthony Albanese as Prime Minister. They're actually getting Bill Shorten. All of these policies are what Bill Shorten took to the 2019 election. The Labor Party tried to drop and hide for the 2022 election, but Bill Shorten is back. He is back with his agenda of taxing superannuation and taxing franking credits, and, we expect, probably taxing the family home and investment properties in the future as well, like the Labor Party wanted to do in 2019, which was rejected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party also said there would be no return to industry-wide bargaining. That was removed late last year—another promise broken just before Christmas. They promised wage rises for aged-care workers. Like the rest of us, they're seeing their real wages go down. Mr Albanese promised that he would deliver cheaper mortgages for the Australian people. He promised cheaper mortgages, and then today, just in the last couple of hours, we saw the tenth increase in interest rates—nine on this government's watch. We've seen nine interest rate increases in the space of 10 months from this government, after promises of cheaper mortgages. Finally, he promised that Australian families would be better off. Clearly, with rising interest rates, rising power prices and increasing taxes, Australian families are not better off under this government. No-one could make that claim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My opponents here will get up and say: 'There were all these problems. We've had the Ukraine war and all these things.' Guess when Ukraine was invaded: February last year, three months before the election. It happened then. Guess when inflation started peaking: about 18 months ago. He should have known that then. The Labor Party knew they were telling fibs to the Australian people a year ago. They tried to hide it. It's been exposed. Now they have a litany of broken promises that are going to be held around their necks until the next election, in two years, when the Australian people have their say on how they think broken promises should be treated.</span>

Public trust in government has been at an all-time low after a decade of the Liberal coalition government. I will put up Anthony Albanese as Prime Minister against Scott Morrison any day. The Australian people finally saw through the Liberal coalition under Scott Morrison for their rorts, dishonesty and lies. They made their judgement based on what they had experienced for over a decade.</span>

That is what this opposition will be remembered for, for some time to come. It's very unfortunate that those opposite have the audacity to come in here and make these claims about broken promises when, in fact, the Australian people still see us as the government of hope, the government that will put their interests first and the government where they know the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister, not a prime minister who tries to take on other ministers' portfolios.</span>

It's not just a problem of the Australian government. It's actually Australian people's debt that we have inherited from a lacklustre, dishonest, rorting government. They're the facts, so it doesn't matter how many times those opposite come into the chamber and want to rewrite history. They want to make everyone feel that they haven't been looked after or the promises that we made at election time have not been fulfilled. They know that they have cheaper medicines. They know that they have affordable child care. They know that we will be addressing climate change. They also know that there are 180,000 fee-free TAFE places. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When those opposite were in government they were very proud of the fact that they were running down TAFEs, with their state colleagues in Tasmania, and did nothing about building Australia's skills. They did nothing to protect manufacturing in this country—not a thing. Under the former government we saw manufacturer after manufacturer leaving this country and going overseas. Why? Because they were never on the job. Now they come in here and bleat about the 0.5 per cent of the population who have $3 million in their superannuation funds. They're crying crocodile tears for those people, but they don't give a damn about the average Australian who has $120,000 or less in superannuation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You never hear those opposite come in and defend Australian workers. We saw them do nothing to address the concerns about the crisis in aged care, where we can't get people to work. We didn't see them doing anything about legislating to bring more nurses back into aged care. We heard absolutely nothing. We heard nothing from them when it came to instilling the support of their government to skill up Australians. They did nothing for low-paid workers, and they come in here now and try to rewrite history. </span>

I will guarantee one thing: history will actually hold Anthony Albanese, the Labor Prime Minister of this country, in much better esteem than history will ever show Scott Morrison and his government, with their rorting and dishonesty—and the fact that Scott Morrison had so much faith in his ministerial colleagues he took over responsibility for their portfolios! I mean, come on: give me a break. It is just ludicrous for those people to come in here and try and defend their record—the record of rorters, cheats and people who are dishonest with the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  As a servant to the many different people across Queensland who make up our amazing Queensland community, I'm speaking to Senator Canavan's matter of public importance. This MPI quite fairly criticises the Albanese Labor government for their record of broken promises already, including a promise not to raise taxation and a promise not to change superannuation. The Prime Minister is now raising tax on unrealised earnings of large superannuation funds. Way to go! Labor are running a two-for-one sale on broken promises, just in time for the New South Wales state election, where 5½ million voters are going to ask themselves: 'Do I trust Labor with government? Will they keep their promises?' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be fair, the Albanese government has not resorted to dividing promises into core and non-core promises—yet. But wait; it's early days. Their promise to bring down the cost of living is already broken. Today, Brisbane's <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail</span> newspaper reported that an average household in Queensland now has to spend an additional $1,150 a month to pay their bills and keep a roof over their head. That is a hell of a lot of money for everyday Australians to find every month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government is wrongly trying to blame international pressures for gas price rises. Gas was already increasing rapidly before the Ukraine conflict. The gas price rise has nothing to do with war between countries and everything to do with the war on coal. As the government closes down energy-intensive coal power and introduces more weather dependent solar and wind power, the grid needs more and more gas to firm the supply and maintain reliable power. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Household gas is costing more as large electricity generators bid in the market for the gas they need to keep the electricity grid functioning. Increasing gas prices are demand inflation. Housing price rises are demand inflation. Four hundred thousand new Australians arrived in the last 12 months—400,000—all needing houses in which to live. Of course the price was going to rise. No wonder the Albanese government changed their election promise from 'cheaper power' to 'power going up less quickly'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every coolroom in every farm and dairy, and every Coles store and every other supermarket is now more expensive to run. Every bakery, restaurant, butcher, store and shopping centre is passing on huge increases in power prices. Mortgage repayments are rising because the previous government's money printing caused increasing interest rates. Labor went right along with those measures and is equally to blame for the inflation that that's now caused. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, Treasurer Jim Chalmers recklessly, wrongly, uncaringly claimed the worst of inflation is over. Really? On what basis? New South Wales voters should not believe that for a moment. Inflation is a direct result of this government's core energy and spending policies. And this government is not going away until 2025. </span>

If the best we're going to get is an ex-Tony Abbott scheme, adopted from the Liberal Party and from Angus Taylor, Australians are going to be bitterly disappointed. They will see this as a broken promise when you campaigned on climate action. That's okay, because the Greens are here to help. It might feel like a thin green line, some days, but we are here to hold that line for the millions of Australians who voted for climate action and make sure that we put our communities, our country and nature first, and make sure that we get an outcome on reducing emissions. </span>

It is very regrettable that there isn't more time. For the enjoyment of the chamber I'll focus on a couple that are known to me in some level of detail. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2019 election there was a policy statement by the Labor Party that it would turn off refundable offsets and thereby, effectively, destroy franking credits for many retirees. This was an agenda put forward by Mr Bowen, now Minister Bowen. He said, famously, in a radio interview in Sydney that if people didn't like that policy they should vote for the coalition. That's what people did in 2019. This time, they've come back and tried to attack franking again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Franking is a policy that the Treasury probably doesn't like. I'm sure Treasury's advice to the government is that they should try to damage franking, much to the chagrin of former prime minister Paul Keating. But rather than being upfront with the Australian people and saying, 'We want to stuff franking,' the Labor Party said they wouldn't touch franking. The quotes are really quite good. On 4 March 2022 Mr Albanese said in Perth that they were not touching them, when referring to franking credits. Just two weeks later he said, 'Labor won't have any changes to the franking credits regime.' The Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told Queenslanders, when it came to tax: 'We won't be doing franking credits. We won't be doing them. I couldn't be clearer than that.' He's certainly doing them. He's doing them over. What we're seeing now is a very sneaky and underhanded way of taking on franking credits. Rather than remove the ability of the funds to receive them, they're trying to turn them off from the corporate end and are thereby trapping $86 billion in credits that are on balance sheets today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum is very interesting. It says that if any entity has never previously made a distribution, then the entity will not have a practice of making distributions. That is the key test in this bill—that it will effectively stuff franking by removing the ability of a company to pay a franked dividend when it has raised capital—at any point in the past, possibly. The link between a company raising equity and then paying a distribution is going to be there in the bill. Therefore, the whole franking system is, frankly, at risk. This will have very serious consequences for Australia as a competitive jurisdiction. People will be less likely to invest in Australian companies. It will be harder for Australian companies to raise equity, and Australian companies will be more reliant on debt as a result of this change. The political point here is that the government should have been upfront and said, 'We are going to change franking.' Instead, they wrapped themselves in these promises. It's very disappointing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the government has done since the election is move the goal posts. Clearly, there has been an agenda to try and feather the nests of their favourite rent-seekers, but this substantial tax change is really going to be a significant change to the system over the long term, because over the long term it's going to be younger Australians who will pay a much higher level of tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we heard in this chamber that 10 per cent of people will be hit by the tax over the long term, and that in the short term it will be about 100,000 people. The point is that, if you've gone to an election saying you won't change the tax settings on super and your promises last less than a year, it shows breaking promises is part of your DNA. Whether it's in this policy area or on climate or on a range of other things across the board, the government has shown itself to be very unreliable when it comes to making promises and keeping them.</span>

                  </a>  In 10 years, they made an art form of it. Four point seven billion dollars in funding to universities was cut, hundreds of jobs at the ABC and SBS were lost, and the former government scrapped the last two years of the Gonski reforms, and those were just the warm-ups. It just got worse and worse and worse. There were billions and billions in entrenched cuts that devastated the services that everyday Australians rely on, including the tearing up of $56 billion in funding under the National Health Partnership Agreement. Ask any Australian how hard it now is to get in to a doctor. Those were the kinds of broken promises that we saw day after day, year after year, during nine wasted years in Australia's history when we could have been really advancing on so many fronts. Mr Morrison was the PM with so many portfolios that he failed to do his day job and failed to fulfil his promises. He promised a religious discrimination bill, but his own party revolted against it. He promised a national integrity commission. He didn't even get up to bringing it into the parliament. He didn't even introduce it in the House. I don't have enough time to list the litany of pretences from the former government. So I'm absolutely not going to take any notice of the crocodile tears from those opposite when they come in here and talk about broken promises.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a joke to see the coalition going in to bat for the richest superannuation holders in Australia at the very same time that the scandalous robodebt program that they instituted is unfolding before the eyes of Australians in the royal commission. Minister after minister, day after day, has been admitting to covering up systemic theft, with debts being illegally raised against their own people. And they dare to come in here and have a go at a government that's actually making a positive difference in the lives of Australians. Let me tell you: when I'm out there, people are saying to me, 'I'm so relieved to wake up in the morning and not feel as if there's a disaster landing on my head.' That was the characteristic of the former government. People know that the former government were happy to send illegal debt notices out to hundreds of thousands of Australians, hound them with debt collectors and then systematically lie and bully their way out of accountability for this tragedy. It was supposedly to improve the budget bottom line, yet they've left Australian taxpayers with a trillion dollars in debt. That's their record in economic realities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, instead, is undertaking a responsible, orderly, predictable cabinet style government such as has not been seen in generations. We are making sure that we bring Australians along with us in facing the challenges that we face. The world changes, and our world needs a careful response from a government that pays attention to the detail. We know that fair and sensible measures need to be undertaken to restore our nation's finances. Those opposite think it's just fine for those people with millions and millions of dollars in super to actually pay a smaller marginal tax rate than a pay-as-you-go earner on a $44,000-a-year salary, and they think it's fine to borrow billions of dollars to keep in place those tax arrangements in super for people who have balances over $3 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I love the endeavour of people to get into business, create jobs and get the benefits of business. If you've got $3 million in super, good on you. But, if you've got more than $3 million in super, I don't think you should be getting more of a tax break than is being applied with this option, at 30c in the dollar. I think there are people in your committee who probably need to be able to see a doctor. I think people need services from this government. People need services a lot more than somebody with $3 million needs the protection of those opposite, who are standing up for 0.5 per cent of Australians who are clearly not doing it that tough. We're going to continue on with our plan to support workers, families and small businesses with cheaper medicines, cheaper child care, wage growth and more paid parental leave—game-changing reforms that are real and will make a difference to the bottom line of families across Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300706" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BABET</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">United Australia Party Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was elected to government in no small part because he insisted that his government would be one of integrity. In February 2021 Mr Albanese told the nation it was time to bring integrity back into politics. Well, it has been almost a year now and we're still waiting. Where is the integrity? Should we expect integrity anytime soon? Will Mr Albanese bring it back this year or perhaps next year? Perhaps in 2024 is when we will see the integrity. Now, don't tell us that the war in Ukraine means that the government can't do integrity anymore, because we have used that as an excuse in this place for absolutely everything else. Or is integrity something that he needs crossbench support to deliver? Well, good luck getting the teals to agree to that one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what's funny? The only thing that Mr Albanese talked about more than integrity pre-election was $275 off your power bill. Almost a year in we are still waiting to see a sign of integrity, and the cuts to power bills are nowhere to be seen. Perhaps when the PM promised integrity what he actually meant was dishonesty, like when he promised the $275 cut to power bills. He made that promise, might I remind everyone here, 97 times. Maybe he actually meant rises in power bills, not cuts—kind of like when he promised no changes to super. That's what he promised, but maybe what he meant was changes to super. Much like when he promised that Labor had a plan—a clear plan—for cheaper mortgages. Maybe he meant that the Labor Party would preside over 10 consecutive interest rate rises to now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Less than 12 months into the Albanese government we are actually seeing quite a clear pattern: the government promises one thing, and the government goes and does something else. How is that for integrity? They say this, but they go and do that. The Prime Minister says you can absolutely, most definitely rule out changes to capital gains tax on the family home, just like he said you can rule out changes to superannuation, and then he goes and announces changes to superannuation and he doubles the tax rate. Why would you believe a word that this government says? Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister was so confused by the constant changes to super policy—a policy that, of course, we were assured before the election wouldn't happen—that he couldn't answer basic questions when he was on Sky News recently with Peter Stefanovic. No wonder the Deputy PM was confused: he has no more faith in his government and their policies than the rest of us do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a special kind of dishonesty to promise integrity and then break so many promises to the people that believe the claims of integrity. Mr Albanese can sure walk across the harbour bridge in a pride march, but do you know what he can't do? He can't walk in a straight line; that's what he can't do. The Treasurer, 'super' Jim Chalmers, can write 6,000 words on remaking capitalism—that's what he did—but he'd be hard pressed to write 60 words on what it means to operate with integrity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time that we bring integrity back to politics, Mr Albanese—it's time. We're all waiting for it. We're waiting for integrity from your government, just as Mr Chris Bowen is patiently waiting for his taxpayer funded Tesla—that's what he's waiting for. We're waiting for integrity from this government in the exact same way that Tanya Plibersek is patiently waiting for her chance to assume the top job. Actually, the way this government is going there is far more chance of seeing that than of seeing any integrity. Mr Albanese started with so much promise. What a pity he has not kept any of his promises. Does Mr Albanese not understand that democratic nations run on trust? The citizenry grant permission to government to exercise authority in exchange for a government's commitment to act honestly and to act fairly. That's the deal, and Mr Albanese has trashed that deal in less than 12 months. The litany of broken promises shows all of us that. Next election, vote differently. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The media reports which prompted this inquiry suggested Mr Martin is a former member of an outlaw motorcycle gang and that the joint committee was conducting an inquiry or held briefings which examined matters relating to such gangs. In considering whether Senator Thorpe's failure to declare the relationship obstructed the work of the joint committee, the Privileges Committee examined not just the specific impact of her failure to declare the personal relationship but also whether there was a wider impact on the operation of the joint committee. The committee sought and considered submissions from Senator Thorpe and the joint committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter relates to alleged conduct which, if proven, could only be addressed by the Senate exercising its power to determine and punish contempts. Media coverage of this matter was clearly intended to suggest that Senator Thorpe had utilised her membership of the joint committee to further the interests of an outlaw motorcycle gang. A senator using his or her position on a committee to access sensitive information from law enforcement agencies in order to further the interests of a criminal organisation would, of course, be amongst the most serious possible contempts. To the extent that it was conduct forming part of the proceedings of parliament, it could only be sanctioned by the Senate. However, the evidence to the Privileges Committee demonstrates that the media coverage of this matter was inaccurate in some important respects. In particular, the implication that Senator Thorpe used her position inappropriately or even had access to information of the type speculated about in the media coverage is not borne out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint committee advised that it had no evidence that Senator Thorpe had declared a possible conflict of interest in relation to a personal relationship. Senator Thorpe accepted in her submission that she should have declared this possible conflict. The committee agrees that Senator Thorpe should have declared her relationship as a potential conflict of interest with her work on the joint committee. It was possible that she would receive sensitive material of interest to outlaw motorcycle gangs through her work on the committee; however, on the basis of evidence it has received, the committee is satisfied that no disclosure of such material has occurred and that the operations of the joint committee have not been impeded. The committee therefore concludes that a contempt should not be found in relation to the matters referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also wishes to make some recommendations concerning the strengthening of the process for declaring conflicts of interest. The committee urges all senators to exercise caution in relation to possible conflicts of interest as well as the perception that their personal relationships may conflict with their official duties. All senators should take a scrupulous approach to such matters. Where there is any doubt, they should seek the advice of colleagues or of the Clerk. Senators must be aware of their responsibilities to perform their roles in the public interest, to declare any possible conflicts, and to comply with the standing orders by not sitting on a committee where they have a conflict of interest. Transparency in relation to such matters serves to resolve most issues and is critical to maintaining the confidence of submitters and witnesses in the integrity of committee proceedings. To support a more consistent approach on these matters, the committee has recommended that declarations of any conflict of interest should be a standard agenda item at all private meetings of all committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their considered approach to this matter. I commend the report to the Senate, and I do wish to say that the manner in which the Privileges Committee has dealt with this has been very much in the interests of the Senate as a whole. It is not just a bipartisan committee; it is actually a nonpartisan committee. Certainly Senator O'Neill as the deputy chair—I know she has made this reflection on a previous chair, Senator Abetz—has said that the operation of this committee for a long time has been nonpartisan. I certainly hope, and it is my intention as chair, that it will stay that way. Once again, I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

Over months and months, my family and my children have had to wait with bated breath about the process, the outcome and the transparency in this whole situation. I was basically mauled by the media in that time. I had no relationship with that person. I was given legal advice by the Greens lawyer that I had to say that I dated this person. I got a call from that person, who said, 'Did we date?' We kissed once at a rally. We kissed once at a rally on 26 January. I had no idea who this person was, or his background. My legal advice was to say I dated this person. I got mauled by all of you. I got mauled by the media.

I think I deserve an apology from the Leader of the Greens, for one, because I lost my position as well. For what?

On 15 December 2022, the President received a submission from Mr Jason Riley relating to a speech made by Senator McMahon in the Senate on 30 March 2022. The President referred the submission to the committee under privilege resolution 5. The committee has considered the submission and recommends that Mr Riley's response be incorporated into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. The committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of the statements made by senators or the persons referred to. Rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the motion to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. In the lead up to the Federal election of 2022 I became aware of statements Sam McMahon made in her valedictorian speech to Parliament, in which she identified me by name in connection to a number of issues she said she experienced during her time as a Parliamentarian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. The first comment made by Sam McMahon reflected upon her decision to resign from her Party, as extracted from the relevant Hansard, "<span style="font-style:italic;">My reason to resign was driven entirely by my former staff member, Jason Riley</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">who did abuse and terrorise my office, including myself"</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any and all suggestions I did "abuse and terrorise" former Senator Sam McMahon's office, or Sam McMahon, herself, are completely false, defamatory and without foundation. Available to her throughout the period I was employed by her, and since, were numerous avenues to address issues of staff exhibiting such conduct, including immediate dismissal. Sam McMahon did not avail herself of those remediations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. Sam McMahon went on to say, "…and the party's decision to place him into a position on their central council…"</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the time Sam McMahon alleges this decision was taken, she herself was a member of both the CLP Management Committee and Central Council, however, the Country Liberal Party made no such decision. Furthermore, I neither sought, nor was appointed, any position on the Central Council. In its entirety, the abovementioned statement by Sam McMahon is a prevarication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">4. The final part of the comment Sam McMahon made was, "To have to sit in meetings with such a person was a very stressful experience…".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The only meeting I participated in with Sam McMahon at that point was the Country Liberal Party Central Council meeting, attended by approximately 70 people. I did not participate in any meetings with her subsequent to that event. Prior to that event, I had not participated in a meeting with Sam McMahon for more than two and a half years. In the context of the paragraph from which this comment is extracted, Sam McMahon's words are once again a mix of mistruths and fabrications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">5. Sam McMahon's false statements in her speech have had a direct impact on my wellbeing and future employment opportunities, a condition that continues to today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6. Immediately following Sam McMahon making these comments about me, she embarked on a media campaign, spanning multiple radio and television stations, to discuss her comments made under Parliamentary privilege, with particular focus on the comments she made about me. That practice was detrimental to my character and reputation. Again, I will draw your attention to the fact Sam McMahon had access to a wide range of remediation options and services to deal with the issues she alleges, over an extended period of time, yet she failed to employ any, preferring instead to make her statements under Parliamentary privilege.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">7. I formally request my remarks contained herein are entered into Hansard to form a response to the false and misleading statements Sam McMahon made about me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While employed by Sam McMahon I did not, in any way or at any time, conduct myself in a manner that could be characterized to "abuse and terrorise" either her or other staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am in no way responsible for Sam McMahon's demise with her Party, nor her decision to resign from her Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Should the members of the Privileges Committee require, I stand ready to provide details of witnesses who have agreed to speak on the matters raised by Sam McMahon in her speech to Parliament and to verify my statements made here-in. In each instance, those people can offer first hand, direct evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I rise to take note of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill, which has already been tabled by the government whip. I wish to make some comments in relation to that report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition strongly believes that any discussion or consideration of constitutional change should be—in itself—considered, measured and balanced. The changes proposed in this bill will set a precedent for future referenda and should not be considered as temporary or be adopted lightly. The government's decision to rush this inquiry over the Christmas and summer holiday period is disappointing because it has limited the ability of JSCEM members to effectively scrutinise witnesses and the proposed legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are a number of sensible and constructive changes included in the bill, it is clear that the government has put forward other changes that are not in the interest of an informed and robust process for conducting a referendum. We are pleased to note that the government has agreed to our recommendation that there should be the publication and communication of an official pamphlet. However, coalition members are very disappointed that there will not be a designation of official campaign entities in addition to the adequate and equal funding of 'yes' and 'no' campaigns. In particular, we believe that our recommendations negate recommendation 2 of the chair's report, and we are concerned that the government's report puts at risk a successful referendum process with integrity and appropriate protections against misinformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, along with numerous stakeholders and submitters, remain greatly dissatisfied at the government's decision not to create and fund official 'yes' and 'no' organisations. We believe, regardless of your view on the Voice, that the cases for and against should be dealt with in an appropriate and adult manner across the community and that the referendum should be managed in a manner that is most similar to how a federal election has been run, considering that a referendum has not been conducted in this country for over 20 years. It is for that reason that the coalition do not support the passing of the bill. Further comments will be made when the bill comes before the Senate chamber later this week.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  In respect of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on its inquiry into community safety support services and job opportunities in the Northern Territory, I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As chair of the committee, I tabled the report out of session last week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to first thank those who engaged in this inquiry—specifically the community members, Aboriginal organisations and frontline service providers who gave evidence. Unfortunately, it was not possible to get across all communities in the Northern Territory, due to the time frames. However, we did visit Darwin and Alice Springs, and we had a delegation of Maningrida community members come to Canberra to put their concerns to us. We held virtual hearings with community members, peak organisations, Commonwealth and Northern Territory government departments, the alcohol industry and leading researchers. We also received submissions and private briefings as part of the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was important to hear from all of these witnesses because they brought a breadth of perspective forward. There was not one witness who denied the social or economic difficulties being experienced by Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. However, almost all the witnesses came with practical, holistic and strength based solutions. I'm so grateful for their time, patience and generosity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were asked by this chamber to undertake an inquiry with particular reference to the preparation for the sunsetting of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act, community safety and alcohol management, job opportunities and community development program reform, justice reinvestment community services and any related matters. This was important because these policy areas are all so interconnected. We heard consistent themes about the need for locally led initiatives, for more data sharing and for outcome focused efforts and investment. We heard that the status quo has not worked and change is required. As a committee, we made findings across each of these areas and made nine consensus recommendations to the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments. Many of these are about the importance of local, place based initiatives. They recognise that past attempts by governments through the Northern Territory National Emergency Response and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act were ineffective. We commented that, in fact, the Intervention and the Stronger Futures legislative packages:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… systemically disempowered communities—in their delivery, implementation and transition—causing immense trauma that now requires concerted effort by all levels of government to enable and invest in the re-empowerment of these communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to alcohol management, under these past regimes, the Commonwealth government overrides the Northern Territory by exercising powers to legislate alcohol restrictions. The committee considers it is the appropriate role of the Northern Territory, rather than the Commonwealth, to make such legislative decisions. We also heard extensively about the ineffectiveness of focusing solely on reducing supply of alcohol and not properly supporting people at risk. Witnesses such as the Alice Springs Hospital personnel told us that, instead of focusing only on alcohol:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We really need to go back to looking at the social determinants of health. We really need to start looking at housing, meaningful employment, education, hope and despair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it's so important that the Commonwealth is supporting the Northern Territory government, by committing to a $250 million package under the title 'A Better, Safer Future for Central Australia', which intends to address service, community and infrastructure needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard far too regularly about the failures and, in many cases, the entire lack of service accessibility in remote communities. Where you live should not determine the services or basic amenities you receive, and yet it does for people living in remote communities. As a committee, we all agreed that investment in services and support programs in remote communities is fundamental. We also considered that there needs to be a greater focus on the following: working with communities to determine that service investment; opportunities to enhance place based models of funding and support collaboration amongst local organisations; embedding holistic health approaches to service provision that focus on social, emotional and cultural wellbeing; and sharing real-time data with local communities as necessary. We know that governments need to transfer both power and resources to communities to improve the outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of economic development, we heard a breadth of advice about the potential of a reformed CDP. We know that currently the CDP does not adequately consider what real job opportunities there are in remote communities. We also heard about the innovation in some organisations as part of a trial underway to give greater flexibility in the CDP. The report also makes recommendations to the government to consider how to stimulate economic activity outside of CDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to justice reinvestment, we've heard about the benefits of justice reinvestment models and alternatives to custody initiatives. Many witnesses talked about their experiences and their hopes for this. The committee recommended that both Alice Springs and Katherine be sites as part of the Commonwealth government's landmark $81 million commitment to community led justice reinvestment programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the Intervention and the Stronger Futures legislation failed to improve conditions for Aboriginal people living in remote Aboriginal communities. These acts did not work. In fact they did the opposite. Children born in 2007 and 2008, at the height of the Intervention, are the children at risk of causing harm today. I'm grateful to those young people who spoke with us in private briefings, because it is critical that their voices are central to this discussion. Too often they are talked about instead of engaged with in the solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory are incredibly resilient, but they have been let down enormously by governments of all stripes. Yet they continue to show up with solutions and preparedness to work with governments in good faith. This is despite their right to self-determination being entirely denied. In response to that resilience, this report makes recommendations that seek to address the disempowering legacy from the top-down approaches of the past 15 years. There are additional comments to this report added by Senator Thorpe and Senator Liddle. I commend this report to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="280304" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THORPE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I too would like to comment on the inquiry into community safety, support services and job opportunities in the Northern Territory. During this inquiry we heard from First Nations people across the Territory—families, communities, young people and some services, including community leaders—about the devastating impacts of the Northern Territory Intervention and, later, the Stronger Futures legislation on communities. The Intervention represents one of the darkest eras of First Nations policy this country has seen. Implemented by John Howard and then continued by subsequent Liberal and Labor governments, the Intervention was racist and paternalistic and undermined First Nations' rights to self-determination. The Intervention is evidence of the violent colonisation in this country and its oppressive regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our people have never ceded sovereignty over these lands, waters and skies, which we have cared for since time immemorial. As the oldest living culture on this planet, we know very well how to care for one another, how to look after our old people, how to teach and look after our young people and how to care for country, because that's what we've always done. This knowledge, passed down through generations, remains as strong as our culture and our sovereignty that always was and always will be ours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stronger Futures legislation packages disempowered our communities and added to the trauma caused by colonisation that has impacted our people across generations. Alcohol consumption is a symptom of the impact that trauma has on our communities—trauma that is complex and is only compounded by racist policies that lack proper consultation and certainly lack consent. They undermine our right to self-determination, as we saw with the Intervention and Stronger Futures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This shows the importance of finally ensuring our laws comply with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and of UNDRIP being enacted in this country. While Australia officially adopted the UNDRIP in 2009, this country has no regard for human rights, let alone the rights of First Nations people. The principle of free, prior and informed consent of First Nations people, one of the core principles of the UNDRIP, is of particular importance to ensure First Nations self-determination as well as best outcomes for First Nations people, culture and country. This government refuses to acknowledge that First Nations people are sovereign nations and refuses to go out into communities and sit down and talk with our elders and leaders, who know what is best for their people. Consultation is not consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the committee's acknowledgement of the ways in which these policies disempowered First Nations communities and the inadequate consultation and planning for the sunsetting of Stronger Futures. Despite knowing years in advance that this legislation would be ending, the government failed to properly consult with communities about what should come next. I fully support the committee's acknowledgement of the importance of local community led solutions and initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country, we have a long way to go to make this a reality. Our people, especially our elders, hold the solutions to the challenges we face. This is why we need a treaty with First Nations people. Treaty is a long-overdue end to the war that was declared on First Nations people at the invasion of these lands. It would acknowledge that First Nations sovereignty was never ceded and would provide a pathway for us to move forward. A treaty would enable us to address the underlying oppression and injustices our society was built on. Treaty can create true systemic change to allow much needed healing. Treaty is what First Nations people in this country have been calling for ever since invasion. It will be negotiated sovereign to sovereign and allow clans and nations to determine their own destiny. And it is the way to create jointly a brighter future in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue advocating for a treaty and for the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report to be implemented, because these are what my people across the country have been calling for, and they would actually have a real impact on people's lives. Bringing those messages into parliament is an act of sovereignty. I look forward to bringing all peoples across this country along the journey of this movement towards justice and towards peace.</span>

I think that goes to the very point that I was trying to make: that so little detail has been provided—and here we are, in March—in relation to so many of the issues that we should have had more information on but don't. We're trying to seek that information. Just for the record, you have corrected the advice that I received this morning from the minister in relation to there being no issues in relation to IT. Clearly that was not necessarily accurate.</span>

I put the TGA in there as an example. The TGA changes have a significant impact on the costs of the implementation to the private health sector. I'm asking more broadly, in terms of the increased costs to the sector from the changes in this package of bills and the overall reform package that's here, if any concerns have been raised. Has the department raised any concerns about increasing costs that may be associated with the limitation of innovation and time to market of products that sit within implantable devices? </span>

I really appreciate that because, to be fair, all I have heard in the last few months leading to this package of legislation, which was listed a few weeks ago and now has been relisted, is that there has been a lack of consultation and a lack of information. There has been a propensity to say, 'Don't worry about what you've got here, the outline; we'll give you the details later.' We're standing here today at the start of March. We have started consultation on one part of it that is ongoing. We haven't even started the consultation on another part of the really important detail in regulations and requirements that sit behind the overall operation of the changes that are due to come in on 1 July. Then you tell me that people will have the opportunity for consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that my feedback so far has been quite significantly that people feel like they haven't been consulted. People feel like they have been railroaded. An example that I used this morning is that the mechanism by which the bundling funding is likely to be delivered appears to have been predetermined by the consultation paper that's gone out, which has three possible scenarios through which the new funding model for the bundling might occur. Clearly, the department has drawn a line underneath it and decided that it wants to do it by facility, despite the fact that the sector has been really clear that it believes that it should be done by procedure. To that end, if the department is so hellbent on the bundling funding model being decided by facility, has the department done any work to understand how that is likely to affect rural, regional and remote Australia? Medical health facilities in those communities are often challenged by circumstances that are quite different from those of larger city hospitals. We know that a lot of private health is delivered in rural and regional areas by necessity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have said that this consultation process is going to enable the sector to have significant input into the cost recovery framework. Is the department open to consideration of a model that would be based on the procedure that is being undertaken instead of the facility in which it is being undertaken, or has the department already made up its mind about that? Maybe the department can answer through you, Minister. It does strike me that the department's going out with a preferred recommendation doesn't sound very much to me as though the department is prepared to listen to the sector about what they believe, as the people closest to the coalface, is going to be in the best interest of their ability to deliver for their patients.</span>

I can ensure you that these stakeholders have been seeking to speak to the Department of Health and Aged Care and the minister. I have to tell you that many of them are extremely disappointed at the lack of access that they have been able to have to both the minister's office and the department, so I'm surprised that you would stand there and say that when clearly these people would love to have the opportunity to get access to the department and to the minister. It's something that is just not happening.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also would say this isn't a contested space. This is not a contested space. The opposition, when in government, was very clear. There was a lot of work that went into getting this reform package together. It was not easy. There were a lot of stakeholders with different requirements, and to try and get this to where it is is a credit to the good faith with which the sector has negotiated with the previous government. It is a situation that obviously was inherited by the new government, who has been in the position to bring this legislation forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am merely saying that we have framework legislation that has got no substance to it at all. This is something that is completely consistent with the track record of this government— coming in here and expecting the Senate to vote on something when they don't know the details. It's a bit like: 'Nothing to see here. Trust us. It will all be okay on the day.' You refer to legislative instruments. There are many legislative instruments that, from what I can gather in my discussions, do not even have to come back into this place in relation to regulations that sit under many of the subordinate pieces of activity that sit under this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, if you'd bothered to wait for a little bit longer and had actually done the work on the cost recovery arrangements and the funding model for those items that were no longer going to be on the list and are going to be contained in general use, and if you had bothered to go and do all this consultation and then brought this piece of legislation back into this place, knowing that the sector had had the opportunity to speak and to provide information more broadly to other members of this chamber—because I know there are many other members of the Senate who would have been very keen to understand what the stakeholders, who are the private hospitals, the suppliers, the private health insurers, the patients and the clinicians, think of the details that sit underneath these changes—it would have given us a great deal more confidence that we actually had got this right. We have got no idea whatsoever whether what sits under this is going to be acceptable to the broader sector. Most particularly, we do not know, because we have no detail, whether it is going to be something that is of overall benefit to patients and whether it's going to be something that is more broadly accepted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an example, I ask you: can you guarantee to us, without any information here about what is included and how the funding model is going to work and the like, that there will be no changes to surgeries in hospitals because they are no longer able to afford to deliver a particular type of surgery because the funding mechanism for the bundling means that the hospital decides that it's no longer going to undertake that procedure? Can you give us the guarantee?</span>

In terms of whether or not surgeries can change or won't change or whatever, private hospitals make those decisions all the time based on a range of factors, so I don't think any person in this place could ever say that no surgeries would change at a private hospital, because they change all the time based on a whole range of factors.</span>

It doesn't stop you from having undertaken the consultation so the clarity of what will be contained in those instruments and the detail about what will actually happen on the ground is known before the framework is put in place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst I appreciate the lecture on how legislation works, I don't think I was suggesting for a minute that we put legislative instruments into this place before we had the enacting framework in terms of legislation. I was simply saying that it would have been an entirely respectful thing to finish your consultation with the sector on the details of some very significant implications from changes that have been four years in the making. For four years the sector has been working together to try and come up with this reform package to make sure that Australians are getting cheaper access to implantable devices, that the Prostheses List is streamlined and fit for purpose and that we continue to be able to provide, through the private health system, access to these life-saving, life-changing procedures. It would have been respectful to finish the consultation. In some instances, this government hasn't even started the consultation for something that is going to have to be in place by 1 July. It seems like it is rushed. I'm sure you're going to move your amendment in a minute. Once again, it seems like we've rushed the legislation in an attempt to tick and flick and say: 'We've got this legislation done and out of the way. Don't worry about providing any detail; we can fix it all up later.' I really do hope that your categorical commitment that this is not going to have any impact holds true in due course.</span>

Where are we at in terms of the development of the prescribed list guide used for administering private medical device listing processes from 1 July?</span>

                    <a href="243273" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Oppositi</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">on Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  The reason I want to speak to this amendment, which relates to the exercising of the powers by the minister, is that I think it once again speaks absolutely to the fact that we have a piece of legislation that clearly has been rushed in being put together. It hasn't been well thought through. It hasn't been broadly consulted on. So what we find ourselves with here—and this is out of your own explanatory memorandum—is an amendment seeking to require the minister to have regard to matters when proposing to remove a listing from the rules or proposing not to carry out activities in relation to a debtor if there are unpaid fees and levies—because one of the bills that are sitting here actually provides the capacity for somebody who hasn't been paying their levies to have their devices or instruments removed from being eligible for reimbursement. It was very much a blanket requirement in this bill for that to be the case. Nobody had actually sat down and thought about what the implications may well be for the patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we've seen here is that today, at the eleventh hour, this amendment is being rushed in here. It was rushed in 20 minutes before it might well have been voted on had it not been that there were so many issues that I wanted to seek clarification on. This amendment now requires the minister, in exercising his powers to make a determination where somebody is going to be removed because they have not paid their fees or levies, to have regard to whether the exercise of that power 'would be detrimental to the interests of insured persons'—that is, the patient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have this piece of legislation that would allow the minister, without any regard whatsoever for the potential implications fora patient, to remove a particular supplier because of unpaid fees or levies. We know that, in many instances with implantable devices, there are often ongoing requirements for the supplier to continue to provide support et cetera. So here we are. We have a situation where no-one actually bothered to think about the impact on the patient. It also requires the minister to determine whether the exercise of these powers will significantly limit the professional freedom of medical practitioners to identify and provide appropriate treatments. So we have not bothered to worry about what the doctors might have thought. So here we are, with this piece of legislation being put through here, with no notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also point out that there was no discussion with us either, clearly with the understanding that we have quite a strong interest in this particular suite of bills. Nobody bothered to tell us. It just arrived here 20 minutes before it could have been voted on, which significantly points out that one of the bills in this package of legislation completely and utterly disregarded the impact it potentially could have on patients and on doctors. There's a lack of detail. It's policy on the run. It's a bit akin to building a plane while you're trying to fly it. It doesn't always end up terribly well. This government should consider attending to the detail in the first place and making sure that its legislation has been thoroughly consulted on, taking into account all of the implications, not just the implications of the top-line stakeholders but looking at who is the most important stakeholder in our health sector, and that is the patient. The government clearly forgot to bother about that here. As we've seen in the discussion I've been having with the minister, we have no detail whatsoever. It is expected that we are just going to wave this through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said earlier that the opposition would be supporting this suite of bills because we believe that it has been a long time coming. We must say, though, that we are hugely disappointed, on behalf of the sector, patients, clinicians and doctors, hospitals, private health insurers and device manufacturers, that we have got so little detail here. Once again, we have created a massive level of uncertainty that we have also seen in the aged-care sector. Right now, we have aged-care facilities out there that don't know whether they're going to be closed down because of their inability to meet the mandated requirements of the legislation that has been pushed through this place, which were impossible to deliver. Everybody knew at the time the legislation went through here that it would not be possible to deliver the mandated requirements because of the workforce shortages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we don't want to stand in the way of policy reform. We absolutely don't, and we won't. I have to say, putting the government on notice, I'm getting sick and tired of coming in here and being expected to ask my team—and I'm sure many of the other frontbenchers on this side are sick to death of coming in here and being told, 'We want you to vote for a piece of legislation.' Then they ask you a question about that legislation, because one of their constituents has raised a particular issue, and we have our hand on our heart and say, 'I don't know what the government's going to do, because they're not going to tell us what they're going to do; they're just expecting us to take this in good faith.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we will be supporting this amendment because the amendment is a good amendment. I'm really pleased that the government has actually seen that this is a good amendment. But I just really, really hope that this wasn't the only mistake that was made in the legislation. If there are more mistakes like this one in this legislative package, then we will be in a world of pain. The consequences won't be felt by the government, the opposition or the Greens, or anybody else in this place; the consequences will be felt by the patients of Australia who need medical procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we have a situation with the requirement of the government to push through its legislation and get it off its legislative agenda. Sadly, we are in a situation where the needs and the wants—and, I think, the obligation—that we have in this place, to pass fully informed, good legislation that is in the best interests of the Australian public, have been denied to us because of the lack of clarity and the lack of consultation that has been provided. I say to the minister: please guarantee that this is the only muck-up in the legislation that is being fixed by this, because, of course, we're more than happy to support you in your rectification.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  For a start, if you'd paid attention you'd know it's not a rectification; it's in response to a scrutiny report. This power has existed as is since 2009 and has never been used, so if it's an issue for us it was an issue for you, for 10 years, that you didn't rectify. I think you should do your homework before you come in here and start raising a whole range of rubbish that is, frankly, just wrong.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in response to the scrutiny report, which recommended some additional protections which have not existed with this power since 2009—a power that's never been used. It's not an error. It's actually responding, as government should, to a scrutiny report. It's not rectification—that's the beginning. I would say: the lecture about failure to consult is a bit rich coming from a member of the former government, which announced some of these changes two years ago but—surprise, surprise—didn't see them through, negotiated behind closed doors without consultation and signed an MOU with the industry without consulting anybody else. Coming here and lecturing us about actually going through a proper process, proper consultation, is not right either. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe it's the end of a long day, but, Senator Ruston, I think you know the record on this, which was a secret agreement between you and the industry. You signed an MOU, didn't consult with anyone, went out two years ago and didn't implement it. Now we're finishing the work and we're putting in place appropriate consultation mechanisms through this bill. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  For the benefit of the Senate, I want to briefly read out the relevant passage of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report in relation to this amendment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is … concerned about the breadth of each discretion, particularly given that the exercise of the power … appear to have the potential to affect an individual's rights or interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the point that the finance minister has shared with the Senate this evening that the amendment is in response to the recommendation of the committee. Governments should respond to scrutiny committee reports. I would say, though, that that functions in this place as a fail-safe, a last bastion of defence against the unintended consequences of badly drafted legislation. It can't be relied upon, by either side of this place when they're in government, to pick this stuff up, let alone to ensure that it is actually done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reason, I would hope, that each side of politics strives to get into government. One reason, surely, is to have the resources of governmental departments at its disposal. You would think those departments would be able to pick this stuff up before a parliamentary scrutiny committee would be able to pick it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is true that the government is responding to a report, as it should, the very fact that we've come to this space is quite concerning to the Australian Greens. I would join with the minister in their criticism of the former government's seemingly systemic inability to effectively consult with relevant affected communities. Being in the disability space, I've experienced a lot of that. However, that's a very low standard against which to judge yourself. I should hope we can raise it just a little bit higher and we can do just a little bit better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to health policy more broadly, we will have the opportunity, either this evening or tomorrow, to really have the rubber hit the road in relation to consultation. We all know that coming up tomorrow is a bill in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We all know that right now this place is in the middle of negotiations over the implementation of a long-fought-for recommendation resulting from the Senate inquiry that considered, among other things, the impact of the transvaginal mesh scandal upon women. The No. 1 recommendation of that report was to have a mandatory framework for reporting of faulty medical devices by medical practitioners. It was supported at the time by the AMA, the RACGP and the Consumers Health Forum. We will have an opportunity tomorrow to consider an amendment by the Greens to put that recommendation into effect as a product of consultation with the affected community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will have an opportunity in that moment to see just where the government's—and indeed the opposition's—priorities lie. Do they lie with ensuring that Australians are never again subjected to the humiliation and pain of a faulty medical device inserted into them, used upon them, and yet never reported to the relevant authorities, or will we see this government say: 'That sounds like it'll be a bit too much to ask of medical professionals. Even with a one-year lead-in, I think that'll be a bit too much. I think we might just have to wait, even though it has been however many years since that inquiry reported.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am well aware that there are individuals in the AMA who are lobbying this evening against the proposed Greens amendment in this space. I say to them: shame on you. You submitted in support of such a proposal when the inquiry took evidence. To the others in other parts of the health sector who are holding the line tonight: thank you. To those in this chamber keeping an open mind to this amendment: thank you. We keep alive tonight the possibility that this place might put in the work. It might require government departments to do their job and to not just reflectively accept the moaning of peak bodies who don't like having something sprung on them even though this has been waiting in the wings for years. I agree with the minister. The coalition government was absolutely abysmal when it comes to consulting with community, particularly in health. This is your opportunity to do a bit better. We will see, come tomorrow, whether you take it up.</span>

This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to implement a number of measures that seek to ensure continued access to critical prescription medicines. We will be supporting this bill in recognition that it continues the work of the coalition and our very strong commitment to ensuring affordable medicines for all Australians and strengthening our world-class health system, of which Australians are rightly very, very proud. This bill will also support the safe use of therapeutic goods by strengthening post-market monitoring and compliance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need to safeguard patient safety and ensure the early detection of adverse events related to medical devices was emphasised as long ago as during the 2017 Senate inquiry. It is absolutely imperative that, whenever we put legislation through this place, first and foremost, we put the safety of patients at the forefront of all of our decision-making. In 2017, the Senate inquiry followed an investigation of medical devices that were developed in the late 1990s which had later reported widespread complications with patients. We heard Senator Steele-John before refer to a particular incident and inquiry in relation to the adverse impacts of a particular device that had absolutely devastating and quite widespread consequences for the women who were implanted with that device. But, from that inquiry, recommendation 1 noted that adverse event reporting plays a vital role in a post-market surveillance and proposed a scheme of mandatory reporting by health practitioners to prioritise health safety. It is obviously very important that we continue that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequently, this bill introduces a framework for mandatory reporting requirements for hospitals to report adverse event information, supporting improved monitoring, early detection and timely action to safeguard patients from harm. There were a number of other recommendations that were included in that report, many of which I hope that the government will have a look at implementing over time. As I said, we're very happy to support this important piece of reform legislation, which is absolutely putting patient safety at the centre of its intention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also make a number of amendments to improve requirements, codify current practices and remove certain provisions from the legislation. The bill will also introduce a dedicated marketing approval pathway for 'export only' biologicals to support the important export market for Australians. I don't know that many Australians actually realise how huge the export market is or the kind of respect that Australian biologicals have in the international marketplace. This bill will ensure that we have a system that allows our fantastic Australian based manufacturers to be able to get easy access to a world market so that they can continue to provide world's best practice when it comes to these particular products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also enable the Department of Health and Aged Care to approve the importation of overseas prescription medicines that are substitutes for medicines which have previously been approved in Australia, assisting to relieve supply shortages. Sadly, at the moment, we have significant supply shortages, particularly for medicines, so this seeks to remedy against that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition absolutely supports the intention of this bill to ensure continued access to potentially life-saving and life-changing and life-improving medicines for Australian patients. However, more can and must be done to safeguard accessibility to critical health care for Australian households currently facing significant cost-of-living pressures. Recently, it was reported that the out-of-pocket costs for general practice consultations have risen to $60 for some practices, and the cost to fill a prescription has also risen quite significantly, at the same time as we've seen increases in things like energy bills and mortgage payments, and everybody knows that when you go to the supermarket the bill at the checkout is significantly higher than it was. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Action to ensure continued access to critical health care must include a plan to relieve these significant cost pressures of living, which are only continuing to rise as we stand here today. This is why the coalition has been so concerned by recent notification of the government's decision in relation to a life-changing medicine, Fiasp, which is currently on the pharmaceutical benefits list—this particular drug is an insulin product. It's a new and innovative product that was listed in 2019, I believe. Over 15,000 Australians who have access to this particular product rely on it to manage their diabetes and their symptoms and alleviate the conditions and consequences of this. The former coalition government listed this product on the PBS in 2019. That ensured affordable access to this fast-acting insulin for diabetic patients. But now it appears as if access to this product will no longer be available in Australia. That means those 15,000-plus people who have been relying on this innovative product will no longer be able to get access to these scripts. This puts extraordinary cost-of-living pressure on them because, if they are no longer able to meet those requirements or get access to it, the costs of other product options are significantly higher. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only important that we look at ways in which the government can continue to supply critical medicines for Australians that rely on them. They must also make sure that those medicines are affordable and Australians can continue to have access to them, because the reliance on those medicines in this healthcare system is so important. The coalition were really pleased to have listed over 2,900 new or amended medicines on the PBS during the time that we were in government. This came on top of a 2012 admission by the previous Labor government that they'd had to stop listing medicines because they couldn't afford to list them. I hope the decision in relation to Fiasp is not one that will signal the return to new medicines not being listed and existing medicines coming off the PBS because they can't afford to continue to list them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I absolutely want to reiterate that the coalition supports the necessary intention of this bill, and that is to strengthen the safe use of therapeutic goods and to support continued access to critical medicines. We do have concerns with some elements involved with this legislation, and we are particularly concerned by the way schedule 10 of this bill removes the natural justice hearing rule regarding publication of certain product information by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Product sponsors currently have access to natural justice prior to the proposed publication of information by the TGA, providing them with an important opportunity to respond to potentially damaging allegations made by the TGA in relation to their products. Removing this provision would deprive product sponsors of access to that natural justice before the product information is published, which could have potentially serious implications for these providers. It is also absolutely an underlying principle of this nation that natural justice is something that should be afforded to everybody. For this bill to seek to deny that natural justice to an organisation without the appropriate recourse that should rightly be afforded to them is a significant oversight. Obviously, we are particularly concerned about that, and we are hopeful that the government intend to rectify that. By removing this provision we deprive the product sponsors of access to natural justice. While we support the need for the TGA to be able to urgently publish information relating to critical safety issues that significantly affect public health, this bill, in its current form, also allows the TGA to publish efficacy and quality related information where there is no corresponding urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these reasons we are keen for the government to amend this particular bill and to make changes to schedule 10 to only relate to the release of information on issues that relate to safety. On behalf of the coalition, I am more than happy to say that we will be happy to support this bill, although obviously we're very keen to make sure that the amendment to schedule 10 is moved.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens particularly welcome that the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022 has come from recommendations as a result of many people across the country sharing their really horrific experiences with the Senate community affairs inquiry into transvaginal mesh implants and related matters. Before I get to the end of my allocated time tonight and get cut off, I want to acknowledge the energy that it takes to share your lived experience with a Senate committee. And I want to thank the committee—including the then chair, former Greens senator Rachel Siewert—for their work in developing the recommendations that have led us to this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of transvaginal mesh for women was devastating—absolutely devastating. As quoted in the inquiry's final report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">[W]e believe this is a catastrophic failure of the health system to protect women and ensure they have access to safe health care. We feel that women have been let down by their doctors, by the manufacturers of mesh and by the TGA as the regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the keywords I want to keep in people's minds—a 'catastrophic failure of the health system to protect women' and 'we feel that women have been let down by their doctors, by the manufacturers and by the TGA'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the decision that will come before this Senate tomorrow will be whether we answer those calls with action—actually implementing the recommendations of the inquiry. So many gave their time and energy to generate those recommendations for a full mandatory reporting framework, not the half-baked half-measure the government is putting forward this evening in the form of its definition of what healthcare facilities should or should not have to report. Let me state this clearly: the report really did not mince its words. All medical practitioners, as defined in the act, 'should report'. They should report to keep people safe. The Greens will be putting forward an amendment tomorrow to give effect to that recommendation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  In 1977 a group of French leftist intellectuals signed a petition for children to be able to legally give sexual consent. Now, there are some sections of society that have wanted to lower the age of consent for decades, seeking to characterise it as legitimate sexual orientation. Today, these same people argue for the use of the term 'minor-attracted person' to replace the term 'paedophile'. Why? Because the term 'paedophile', they say, carries with it too much stigma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot allow this movement to gather steam. We have to close the loop on this now, and on those who seek to normalise this behaviour. But unfortunately the filthy underbelly of leftist academia has other ideas, with one academic from Columbia University writing:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If paedophiles are no longer forced to live underground and to be secretive about their relationships, but instead their desires are recognized as legitimate, and they are guided towards a responsible expression of their desires, we might prevent some cases of genuine sexual abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This recognition is cloaked under the pretence of preventing abuse. But anyone with common sense knows that the real-world impact of recognising these desires as legitimate will actually be the opposite. It's a trojan horse. Many dismiss the concept of the slippery slope, yet it gets proven true time and time again. We've seen it with euthanasia, COVID restrictions, climate alarmism and so on. The pattern's predictable. People like me express concern and get ridiculed—and a short period of time later, those predictions come true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent SBS article described a drag-queen story-time event in Sydney that was protested. Counter-protesters chanted, 'Love is love.' Now, what does 'love is love' have to do with grown men dressed in women's clothes reading to children? Why the focus on a children's event? Can anyone explain that? Can anyone explain why a Mardi Gras mural in Sydney featured a man in a BDSM outfit wearing a teddy bear mask? How about the Balenciaga photographs featuring children with stuffed animals in bondage? Rest assured, something is deeply wrong with our culture. In the United States, babies and toddlers are being exposed to grown men dancing in G-strings in strip show-style performances, and it won't be long before that behaviour makes it to our shores and we will be told it's 'just a colourful bit of fun for the kids'. I expect that sooner or later we'll be having discussions in this place and in state parliaments all around the country about lowering the age of consent, and those who oppose it will be called all sorts of colourful names—'prudes', 'bigots', 'reactionaries'. We'll be mocked for being discriminatory against minor-attracted persons and not sensitive to their feelings. Then, again, we'll be saying, 'I told you so,' while the Left celebrate their so-called progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a society that's attacking the innocence of children and the sanctity of the family, which is the foundation of our society. Without strong families with a loving mother and father, society falls apart. Today children are bombarded with sexual concepts from all sides, and parents are often ill-equipped to deal with it. Our children deserve to be protected. Yet the political class and the passive apologists of this nation are failing them. Australia, be warned: you are witnessing the precursor attacks designed to lower the age of consent and normalise the sexualisation of children. I, for one, will fight it with every fibre of my body, and I suspect that millions of Australians feel the same away. To those who are listening out there, I say: rejecting this behaviour is the right thing to do. It doesn't make you a transphobe; it doesn't make you a homophobe. If men want to dress in women's clothing, that's their business. But stop trying to sexualise the children. Leave the kids alone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I rise to speak about a recent visit to Hillwood Berries farms, at Hillwood in northern Tasmania. Hillwood Berries is a national supplier of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. You will often see these wonderful Tasmanian-grown products in Coles and Woolworths across the country. The Dornauf family are proud Tasmanian farmers who have built a strong business that plays an essential role in agriculture and farming across Tasmania. I visited their farm gate with the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, the Hon. Pat Conroy, to announce reforms to make skills training more accessible, flexible and affordable for Pacific Labour Mobility—PALM—scheme workers and their Australian employers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hillwood Berries employs over 550 workers from the Asia-Pacific, mostly Tonga and Samoa, as part of this scheme, and they continue to return to Tasmania annually, strengthening ties between our nation and the region, improving their family's opportunities and social mobility at home. Hillwood Berries is a great employer. It has a 70 per cent return rate of workers. Once they work at Hillwood Berries, so many islander workers return again and again. The efficiency and success of this workforce is also building full-time equivalent positions within the business. Consequently, Hillwood Berries is going from strength to strength, with their Bundaberg operation growing to the point where they can now supply berries nationwide all year round.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to many of the workers at Hillwood, and they all have inspiring stories. Rufina represents just one of those special stories. When she picks berries, she counts the number of punnets she picks to know how many bricks she will be able to purchase that day to build her house back home in Timor-Leste. Every two hours of work at Hillwood translates into one stone to build her family's new house. Such stories are a great example of what this scheme is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour mobility is a powerful way of supporting economic development in the Pacific. One-third of Pacific islanders live on less than $1,000 per year. In contrast, the government estimates that the average PALM scheme worker in Australia sends home between $1,000 and $1,300 every month they're working here in Australia. We have 4,200 PALM scheme workers in my home state of Tasmania right now, making a valuable contribution to their home economies and filling critical work shortages in Tasmania. Across Australia there are more than 35,000 PALM scheme workers filling workforce shortages in regional Australia and sending valuable earnings to the Pacific and Timor-Leste. In a region where more than one-third of people live on less than $1,000 per year, long-term PALM workers send home on average $15,000 each, boosting Pacific economies and lifting families out of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the comments of Hillwood Berries General Manager Simon Dornauf:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">PALM scheme workers are critical for businesses such as ours but they are also a long way from home and it's vital that we support their development and look after them as best we can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Workers are making such a valuable contribution both here and at home and they bring so much to this business and community in our part of Tasmania. We regularly receive photos of houses the workers are building at home and the improvements they are making to their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pacific workers are making such a valuable contribution both here and back in their own communities at home. They're putting food on the table of Australian families and they are the backbone of agriculture in Tasmania right now. They should be celebrated. We thank them for their work. We thank them for enriching our communities. And we thank them for what they're able to contribute back in their home communities to help raise the living standard of their community members. This is a great scheme. It's one that has been improved by the Albanese Labor government. I want to again place on the record my appreciation for Minister Conroy making that visit and allowing me to join and have the opportunity to not only meet many of these workers but hear them sing and dance for us. It was very moving. I want to thank the Dornauf family for what they're doing in helping to build relationships between the Pacific islands and Australia, as this Labor government is doing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  The Australian Senate spent an hour today debating a motion on the first anniversary of the start of the war of aggression by the Russian government on the sovereign state of Ukraine, an illegal, unethical and immoral invasion of a sovereign nation. I wondered how many senators today in this chamber were also aware that in just two weeks time, on 20 March, we have the 20th anniversary of another illegal, immoral and unethical invasion of another country, which our nation shamefully participated in: the invasion of Iraq.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said in my first speech to the Senate that, one way or another, that event was a major part of my journey to being in the Senate  that night. I'd never been so angry about anything in my life as I was when our nation participated in that war of aggression. And I wasn't alone. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Australia. Millions took to the streets around the world. It was the biggest protest seen in Rome at the time and, indeed, in London. There were half a million people in Hyde Park in Sydney, where Simon Crean, the Labor leader at the time, spoke out against this war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, nevertheless, even though there was this groundswell of foreboding and fear and anxiety that we were going to get dragged into a war that didn't need to happen, it happened. The people were ignored. And we were right. We were right about our fears and our concerns, because this conflict is still being felt today, nearly 20 years after it was initiated by the so-called coalition of the willing. Hundreds of thousands of people were directly killed, many of them innocents, in this war of aggression. There was instability across the entire region for over a decade, including the Syrian civil war. The invasion of Iraq and the insurgency gave direct rise to Islamic Sate and more global terrorism and, ultimately, to a wave of millions of refugees, a wave of human misery, across Europe following this conflict. And what did we achieve from it? More importantly, what have we learned from it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday 18 March and on Sunday 19 March, there will be two rallies for peace in this country: a big one in Melbourne on Saturday the 18th, which I will be attending, at the State Library at 1 pm, and one on Hobart Parliament Lawns on Sunday the 19th. I know there were many Australians that participated in protesting this war who must feel very strongly about this. I also know there are a lot of young Australians who don't remember the Iraq War or the lead-up to the Iraq War, but one of the reasons we have to remember is that the media played a really big role in taking us to that war. And I do want to say I was horrified at the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>and the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Age</span> this morning: 'Australia must prepare for the threat of a China war'. And it clearly just wasn't me who was horrified. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating said today that this article represents:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">the most egregious and provocative news presentation of any newspaper I have witnessed in over 50 years of active public life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">   …   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">the extent of the bias and news abuse is, I believe, unparalleled in modern Australian journalism.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes to explain why this is so dangerous and that our media are either complicit or actively beating the drums for war. Recently the UN Secretary-General said we are 'not sleepwalking' into another global conflict, given what's happening around Ukraine and with NATO and the threats and tensions in our region involving China, we are 'eyes wide open' walking into another global conflict. This is the last thing we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do is remember that, while the media may have largely failed us, one media outlet didn't, and that was WikiLeaks. The only truth teller of the Iraq War, Julian Assange, is sitting in a maximum security prison.  No-one else has been brought to justice because of this illegal war, and it's time we came together on the 20th anniversary, in two weeks time, to remember and remember why this must never happen again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip in the Senat</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">e</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  If you were to assign a symbol that would recognise human ingenuity and encapsulate the technological advancement of our society, what would it be? A plane or a car? Perhaps a computer, or something that might appeal to our younger generation? A smart phone? I want to make the case tonight for something a little bit humbler, a bit more traditional but, nonetheless, remarkable, the windmill. Whether it's for milling grain, pumping water, milling timber or generating power for our cars, computers and smart phones, windmills have many uses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about windmills, you would be forgiven for thinking that they're better known as an icon of Holland, but hear me out. My home state of Tasmania also has a strong connection to windmills, and one in particular. When you travel around Tasmania there are many landmarks you can see. If you are travelling to Hobart on one of our major highways, there's one landmark that might just stand out a tiny bit more than the rest: Callington Mill at Oatlands. This mill is the oldest operating Georgian mill in the Southern Hemisphere. It was built in 1837 and has been an integral part of the village's history. Callington Mill has had a turbulent past. Its ups and downs have been inextricably tied to the ups and downs of the Oatlands economy itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five years ago it was reported that Oatlands was not riding the wave of success that other regional towns across Tasmania were. Despite the mill having undergone a refurbishment of over $2 million, tourists were not stopping. The supermarket, shops and other tourism businesses were at a standstill. They were losing money, and some had even closed their doors. But, in the fashion that has become exemplary of Tasmanians, Oatlands has been quietly undergoing a transformation thanks to the dedication of its community leaders. This transformation is in no small part thanks to the revitalisation of Callington Mill. A nod to the village's history, the mill has become a thriving tourist hotspot, complete with distillery, restaurant and playground. The site also offers heritage tours to ensure history will never be forgotten. It was a site that had been lost to the relentless march of time, but what owner John Ibrahim and his team have done is to create a new vision and future for the mill without erasing its historical significance. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate them on this remarkable achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, while what has been achieved at Callington Mill is incredible, it's only one small part of the village's transformation. Along with the Callington Mill development, Oatlands has also recently opened a $10 million aquatic centre, and the Southern Midlands Council is also working on a project to establish an $18 million boutique hotel. The proposal, from THN Hospitality, which currently operates the Old Woolstore Apartment Hotel in Hobart and Hadley's Orient Hotel in Hobart, would result in a 43-bedroom hotel and associated retail infrastructure. This rebirth has been driven, in part, thanks to the ingenuity of businessmen and entrepreneurs and also by the Southern Midlands Council, who have reinvented the town for tourists and for its residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That laser focus on the future has paid off in dividends for Oatlands. The village was recently announced as the Keep Australia Beautiful Tidy Towns state winner for 2022. Oatlands will compete against all the other state winners at the national awards to be held on King Island—another Tasmanian success story—later this year. Keep Australia Beautiful state judge Lona Turvey noted the number of initiatives to improving the financial and social wellbeing of the community and noted not only the financial developments but the enormous impact of the town's volunteering community. One example of that is the highly successful Heritage and Bullock Festival, which injects about $280,000 dollars back into the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Turvey also recognised the Callington Mill destination playground as a perfect example of how the council valued the opinions and needs of the community to help it grow. The playground was developed with the input of Oatlands District High School students and has opened to great fanfare and much pleasure from young people. The Callington Mill is the symbol of Oatlands. It's used in the town's wayfinding sign and branding, and its rebirth has heralded a new future for that quaint village to ensure any visitors who are travelling past will stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This town's evolution deserves an accolade, and I want to take this opportunity to wish Oatlands well in the national Tidy Towns awards later this year. Congratulations to the Oatlands community. All of Tasmania is behind you when you represent our state on the national stage.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Jacqui Lambie Network Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  Hear, hear for Oatlands! I love me a bit of Oatlands.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What kind of words are there to describe what it's like to be homeless? Is it possible to really communicate what it feels like to someone who's never been through it? I've spent the past few weeks talking to people up and down the chain of homelessness: people who are in the middle of it; people who've been there and come through the other side; people who run support services; and people who build crisis accommodation. Homelessness can happen to anyone. It could be you or me—people with a job; a family. If something happens—maybe they've split up with a long-term partner and there's no family home anymore—they can't afford rent on their own. They think it's just for one night, but that night turns into another and another. Where are they supposed to go? One night you're sleeping in your bed, the next you're out on your own—no bed, no shower, no food, no water, and no idea where you'll sleep tonight—no idea where you'll sleep tomorrow night either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, I was speaking to someone who's been there. She told me that you hear all the stories about homelessness and you think it will never happen to you until one day you're out in the cold. You sleep in your car with nothing but the clothes on your back. She told me that, until you've been there, you don't know what it's like, so I tried it. Now I can't know exactly what it feels like, but I slept for one night in a park, and it was bloody awful. I'm lucky, I had somewhere safe, sound and secure to go to the morning after. People in Tassie sleeping rough don't have that. It was 11 degrees the night I slept in my car, and that's pretty warm for Tassie. But my car is a Jeep. It doesn't have an insulated roof, and that makes it seem a lot colder than it is. I can't even imagine how brutal sleeping in your car in a Tassie winter would be. And what if you don't have a car? Temperatures in Tassie get really cold, and I'm a bit of a softy when it comes to it—cold is cold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I made sure to park in an area with a lot of light so I could see who was coming and going in every direction. But that didn't stop me from jumping at noises. I tried sleeping in all the seats—front seats, back seats. The front seat was definitely better, I can tell you. I picked a car park where I thought there was an open bathroom. It turns out they're locked from 5 pm to 5 am. There is only one 24/7 public toilet in Launceston. The experience reaffirmed what I already knew: nobody chooses to do this; nobody wants to be in this position. People do this because they don't have any other option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent the last 20 years of my life talking to people at different stages of homelessness: my employment services clients who couldn't afford to rent on their welfare payments and people who came to Jacqui's office desperate and crying because they had nowhere else to go and they felt the system had let them down. A lot of the time I felt that I had let them down. I'd call Housing Tas for them, I could tell them where to get food vouchers and groceries and I could give them the numbers for some crisis accommodation. But I couldn't put a stable roof over their heads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm standing here asking the government to guarantee a minimum of 1,200 homes for Tasmania from the Housing Australia Future Fund. But 1,200 is not enough. Twelve hundred homes will barely scrape the sides. There are 4½ thousand people on the housing waiting list in Tasmania at the moment. We're putting a bandaid over a gaping wound that needs stitches. But it's a start, and without this guarantee we'll only get about 600 homes. That means we'll be going backwards. The Housing Australia Future Fund will build 30,000 homes. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2022 housing assistance report says Tassie has four per cent of the country's population with the greatest need for housing. We have four per cent of the need and we are asking for four per cent of the homes. I'll say this: if the fund doesn't build houses where they're needed, what's the point of the fund? If the minister will not guarantee that the fund will build homes where homes are most needed, what the hell are we doing here?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing minister is a Tasmanian. Julie Collins is in the other place because the people of Tasmania elected her to represent them. She knows just how bad things are in Tasmania right now. She's seen it firsthand. Is she really going to stand up and say Tasmania shouldn't have these homes? Twelve hundred homes of 30,000 homes is a pretty reasonable ask. It's our fair share based on the government's own statistics, and the ball's in the government's court right now. It's up to them to decide if they'll help staunch the bleeding or rip the wound open, so that's my message to the government. If you need my vote—if you need our vote—Tasmania needs homes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">INPA PRICE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I want to talk today about priorities. There are few matters more fundamental to government than the safety of its citizens. Providing the conditions for safety and prosperity should be No. 1, but we know that's not the case for this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been nearly two weeks since a senator from South Australia, my colleague Kerrynne Liddle, who was born in Alice Springs, highlighted the plight of an Aboriginal family living on a concrete slab in town. The family left the Utopia community, north-west of Alice Springs, and made the 300-kilometre journey to Alice Springs, seeking health care and support for a 30-year-old woman with third-stage kidney failure. These are good people. They're not drinkers. They're not gamblers. They don't cause problems. They send their kids to school. They try to set a good example and they try to do the right thing, but they're still living on an open concrete slab with nothing but a tarp for protection in the harsh Alice Springs weather. It got up to 38 degrees over the weekend and down to just 14 degrees at night, but in winter it can get below zero at night. They've had nothing but a tarp.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be considered a national shame that in this country we have families left to live unsheltered on a concrete slab, but, as far as this government is concerned, out of sight equals out of mind. Two weeks they have known about this and nothing has been done to help the family. I ask: why aren't they a priority for the Labor government? Why aren't they a priority for the member for Lingiari? Why? It's because the member for Lingiari is more focused on Labor's Voice. That's Labor's priority, but I assure you it's not a priority for the members of the family or anyone like them in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ignoring the voices of her own constituents crying out for help, the member for Lingiari and her Labor colleagues claim to want to correct a system that she believes discriminates against Aboriginal Australians. What's more discriminatory than neglecting the urgent needs of Australians right now so you can use their plight for political gain while campaigning for your own self-interest? What's more discriminatory than ignoring Indigenous Australians while telling the rest of the country that they have no voice? Where are the government funded service providers? They're there to help people in need, but they don't seem to notice the problems. How sad is it that when service providers like Congress and Purple House drop patients off at a concrete slab it seems completely normal? How sad is it that they don't advocate for better housing for these patients? When Tangentyere Council were asked about the situation, they didn't even know who they were talking about. Why are they taking millions of dollars of taxpayer money if they don't even understand the make-up of town camps? Referring to them as rough sleepers is outright dismissive and disrespectful. This is a family living together, doing the right thing, sending their children to school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia doesn't need a voice. We just need people to do their jobs. We need the local members to do their jobs. We need the bureaucrats to do their jobs. We need the taxpayer funded service providers to do their jobs. Two hundred and fifty million dollars was promised by this Labor government to Central Australia, to Alice Springs. They can make a promise of funding, throwing cash about, but they can't address the immediate issues, the crisis right now on their doorstep. Do we know where this $250 million is going to go? Do we know how it's going to be spent? The Territory government have demonstrated for some time that they do not spend wisely. They spend everything in Darwin. They spend where they want to support their supporters, not on vulnerable people like this. We need the government, democratically elected, to stop looking the other way, to stop passing the buck and to actually get on with the job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:59</span>):  Sometimes the happenings of New South Wales politics are so deeply dystopian it seems like it couldn't really be that bad. Surely, you'd think, no serious adults could behave like that, but then the curse of Macquarie Street strikes and everybody in New South Wales says: 'Please, not again; let it stop!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A classic case of the Macquarie Street curse is the Design and Place State Environmental Planning Policy. This started as a good news story, announced by then planning minister Rob Stokes in December 2021. It was that super-rare New South Wales case of a proposed planning law done well, one that recognised the importance of climate resilience for new homes. It wasn't revolutionary, but it proposed a few environmentally sustainable reforms that would have done supersensible things, like preventing black-tiled heat-soaking roofs on new developments in Western Sydney, requiring new builds to be more energy efficient to reduce energy costs, and putting a few eaves on buildings so that houses are kept cooler in summer. It's simple, positive stuff that's good for the planet and good for anyone moving into a new house. Then along comes the curse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021, Premier Perrottet put the notoriously anti-environment Anthony Roberts in as the new planning minister. The rest, as they say, is history. A few days after the fateful appointment, billionaire developer Harry Triguboff, the owner of Meriton Group, wrote to the New South Wales government complaining about the Design and Place SEPP. The developers' lobby, who cemented themselves together as the Urban Taskforce, were also unhappy. They said it might be good for new homeowners and the planet, but it would impact their profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coincidentally, their property industry and Meriton are big donors to the Liberal and National parties. In 2022, the Liberal and National parties took $3.2 million in donations from developers. In New South Wales, Meriton gave the Liberal and National parties at least 200 grand in political donations in 2021 alone. They all just love democracy, it seems. When developers pay and come knocking on government doors, meetings are made available and policy change is on the table. Roberts met with the Urban Taskforce on 15 February and the Property Council on 2 March.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It turns out that he had another critical meeting in April. The Greens used the powers of the New South Wales parliament to force the release of documents about what happened to the SEPP, and the findings were grim. The property industry undermined the government architect, undermined good policy and pushed the right buttons. Then, on 5 April 2022, this one bit of decent law reform was scrapped by Minister Roberts. Here's the kicker: it turns out that on that exact same day, the planning minister, Minister Roberts, met with Meriton Group to discuss planning matters, according to his now public ministerial diary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So who's the real planning minister in New South Wales? It's not Anthony Roberts. He's the tool of the developer industry. Let's acknowledge that the one calling the shots is Harry Triguboff, not his mortgaged puppets sitting in Macquarie Street. Of course, this isn't the only threat to good planning that Mr Triguboff poses. He now has his sights set on beautiful Little Bay in Randwick City Council, planning to override the master plan for that community using the Liberals' appalling Rezoning Pathways program. If his Lane Cove puppet is still planning minister after 25 March, then heaven help Little Bay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good governments are not afraid to give people information. Good governments should not be afraid of FOI, because they know that transparency fosters democracy and public engagement and drives good decision-making. It's not a surprise that the former coalition government systematically eroded the FOI scheme, creating a damaging culture of secrecy and cover-up. It certainly wasn't a good government. They did this through systematically starving the agencies, whose job it was to make FOI work, including the Information Commissioner, of the funds they needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government was particularly blatant about this, when, in its first budget, it abolished both the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Freedom of Information Commissioner--a position that was vacant for seven years. Roll forward to 2023, well into the first year of the new Albanese government, and the FOI Commissioner has quit just one year into a five-year term. The resignation comes as a result of years of whittling away at information access schemes and his office being starved of the funding needed to do its job. This was a statement of exhaustion and frustration delivered to the new Labor government, and it should trouble anyone who cares about open government. It's a public indictment of the current system, highlighting the urgent need for an immediate funding injection to deal with the problems allowed to build up under the former coalition government. This is a test for the Albanese government--fund FOI, support transparency, support good government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  Last week, I did something that the Prime Minister of Australia still hasn't bothered to do. I visited the Western Australian northern Goldfields towns of Laverton and Leonora. The people of these towns are crying out for our help. They are crying out for their voices to be listened to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many contrasts on display in these places. In Laverton, I could hear the unmistakable joy emanating from the community swimming pool as kids played after school in the cooling water. It's without a doubt a sound that warms your heart and brings an instant smile to your face as you're walking past. Sadly, that joy stands in stark contrast to the very different screams locals told me they hear as night begins to fall. It is a more confronting chorus that greets them time and time again. 'You can hear the screaming and the wailing, and you know what's going on; it's horrible,' one local, new to the town, told me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard a series of devastating stories about life in Laverton and Leonora. There is clear evidence in both towns that the Albanese government's abolition of the cashless debit card has been a disastrous policy failure. In Laverton the present situation of a dramatic increase in alcohol consumption, assaults, domestic violence and general antisocial behaviour was described to me by one Indigenous leader as being 'like a speeding car going backwards'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The locals can pinpoint the descent as having started in November of last year, directly after the cashless debit card was abolished in October. The local shopkeeper has the evidence in his sales figures. The sales of meat and vegetables have dropped significantly, and his biggest selling items are now noodles and coke. The kids are no longer being fed properly, if at all. People who were previously on the cashless debit card now withdraw up to $2,000 directly from the ATM in one hit to spend mostly on booze.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Laverton shire president Patrick Hill told me how, as well as cartons of beer, locals are now buying bottles or even cartons of spirits and drinking it like coke. He showed me a picture of a woman who had been brutally bashed and kicked by her partner on the street for over an hour outside the shire chamber. It was sickening. The night before I was in town another woman was stabbed by her partner, and the police were running an operation to locate the alleged offender. Emergency respondents say they are continually seeing women who have been bashed because of alcohol fuelled violence. Police in both towns do a brilliant job but are run ragged dealing with the violence and antisocial behaviour. Well over 90 per cent of all their work can be directly attributed to the abuse of alcohol. They are dealing with people addicted to alcohol on just about every job they attend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A worker at the Leonora Community Resource Centre listed a catalogue of issues that have arisen since the cashless debit card was abolished, including people presenting as drunk or stoned and saying that they're hungry and adult children hacking into their parents' accounts, draining the cash and leaving them destitute. With all funds now available as cash, they now spend it quickly with nothing left for food and other necessities later on. Designated carers and single mothers whose payments used to go into the cashless debit card are now spending most of their money on drinking and then looking for food handouts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The clear message from both towns is that the cashless debit card was not perfect and didn't solve all the problems but it made a big difference. Now that it has been abolished, things have gone back to how they were before it was introduced. One Laverton local said to me, 'Anyone who thinks it didn't work has rocks in their heads.' Leonora shire president Peter Craig said: 'As well as quarantining 80 per cent of their money that could not be spent on alcohol, the card also helped teach those on it a better understanding of money, how to budget and how to pay bills. Some of that knowledge was being passed on from the women to the young people in the community. Much of those gains have now been lost as family members use cash to buy booze, and it's all gone before the bills can be paid.' Many of the kids, who are dealing yet again with the consequences of drunken adults and unsafe environments at home, are no longer going to school or are attending much less frequently than in the past. There is a fear in both towns that suicide will again become an issue in the district, as it was before the cashless debit card was introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigenous leaders that I met with in Laverton are very clear that alcohol is the scourge of their community and they need help in dealing with it. They all agree that alcohol is not culture. They have strong views about the sale of alcohol and the controls that could be put in place but reluctantly accept it is a legal product being sold by legitimate businesses. Their biggest concern is for their people, who they say are dying at an alarming rate. They all know others who are on dialysis because of the damage done by their alcohol addiction. It is well known that the publican in Laverton has, at the request of police, imposed his own restrictions on sales when things have gotten dangerously out of hand, which they have on a number of occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Rishworth yesterday in the other place blamed an increase in the issues in these towns on an increase in the number of people travelling to these towns from the NG Lands and spending mining-royalty money. I can say to the minister: if you go and visit there, the locals will tell you that this is only part of the problem—and part of the problem that has always been an issue. The biggest change, however, has been the Albanese government's ending of the cashless debit card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The presidents of both shires have written to the Prime Minister setting out a way forward and pleading for his assistance. They want the assistance to enhance the welfare of Indigenous people in both towns and also the transient population coming into their communities from the NG Lands, an area that makes up about three per cent of mainland Australia. The plan they set out in their letter covers improved community safety and cohesion by expanding youth engagement and diversion programs, job creation, better services, addressing the issues caused by alcohol, investment in families, and on-country learning and education. They have specific ideas in each of these six categories and have worked on costing each idea. They are requesting a total investment of $81 million across both towns over five years, which could be split between the federal government and the Western Australian state government. So far their letter, written on 20 February, has not even been acknowledged by Prime Minister Albanese. Most of all, when I was there, their message was that they just want the Albanese government to listen to them and to hear their voices. They think the Prime Minister should visit their towns and see firsthand what is going on and what they are going through. That's what the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, did; that's what local federal member Rick Wilson did; and that's what I did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government should immediately restore the cashless debit card in these towns. That's what these towns themselves—the voices on the ground, the people who can directly see the impact of the withdrawal of the card—are pleading for the Albanese government to do. Just because it was an election promise to get rid of the card doesn't mean the government should persist with a policy that, on any analysis, is a complete failure. Further to that, the Albanese government and the McGowan state government need to listen to the voices of the people in these towns. These are the people who know, every day, as the afternoon sets in, that that's when the trouble starts. These are the people who every day, just before the bottle shop opens, see the queues in the streets. Look at what these people are asking for. They've written it. They've put it in black and white to you, Prime Minister. Do something to stop what is without a doubt a catastrophe playing out in these remote towns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, just as the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, knows and just as the local member there, the member for O'Connor, Rick Wilson, knows, that we want to be able to return to Laverton and Leonora in years to come hear the joy of kids playing in the streets and see the kids being properly fed, not wandering the streets and wondering where their next meal will come from because their parents have withdrawn the cash, as they can now do, and have literally spent it on booze and consumed it. My fear, though, is that the Albanese government is just not listening and that there won't be many left, and all the joy in future years will be gone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:14</span>):  In 2015 the residents of Footscray, in the western suburbs of Melbourne, secured a curfew on heavy trucks from the Andrews Labor government. Footscray is my home, so I know what a huge win this was for the local community. It was a triumph for grassroots and community campaigns. Massive trucks powering down our residential streets have caused massive problems of diesel pollution and noise through their sheer bulk dominating the streets. And they endanger people's lives. Yet, eight years later, the Andrews government has failed to adequately enforce and monitor the curfew, and Footscray residents continue to be appallingly impacted by the continuous presence of heavy trucks and road trains. The massive problems of these massive trucks continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About 25 road trains use Footscray's Moore Street every day to deliver material to the West Gate Tunnel project, as well as around 2,000 other trucks. Despite a statement in 2018 by the Premier that material for this project would be delivered by rail freight, Footscray's streets have become a major thoroughfare for road trains and other heavy vehicles delivering material to the West Gate Tunnel project. Disappointingly, a growing number of these trucks have exemptions from the government to access residential streets in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These trucks have a huge negative impact on the wellbeing and health of this community. Constantly breathing in diesel pollution from dirty vehicles is bad for people's health. A recent study by the University of Melbourne found that air and traffic pollution likely claims more than 11,000 Australian lives every year. And I have heard countless stories from residents who have been woken in the night by the loud noise of trucks turning or accelerating through their streets. Many people have told me how difficult it's been to get the children to sleep through the night, and others have shared how they've begun to experience ongoing sleep deprivation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more alarmingly, not only are these heavy vehicles disturbing the sleep and hearing of residents of Footscray but they are endangering the lives of pedestrians and cyclists. Just a month ago, a 22-year-old cyclist, Angus Collins, was tragically killed by a truck on Footscray Road at an intersection that was made incredibly dangerous by the construction of the West Gate Tunnel. My heart goes out to his family and friends. I recently heard from Elizabeth, a local resident, who was nearly run over by a truck while walking to school with her son. She told me that, while turning left from Moore Street in Footscray, the truck mounted the kerb and came so close to her and her son that she could have touched it with her hands. Elizabeth told me that the experience left her feeling angry and disempowered—angry that her son can't walk to school safely and disempowered by the broken promises of the Andrews government to the Footscray community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also angry. I was elected to the Maribyrnong City Council 20 years ago this month, and a big part of my council election platform was campaigning about trucks. The community has seen little to no change regarding heavy vehicles in the decades since. It is so wrong that cyclists are still being killed by trucks and that Elizabeth is worried about the safety of her kids walking to school on the very same intersection on which I was worried about my kids walking to school 20 years ago. The community have been stonewalled and stymied, with minimal action being taken by the state government in that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Footscray community fought hard for the truck curfew in 2015, and it should be upheld. I call upon the Andrews government to adequately enforce the truck curfew, to immediately end all exemptions given to heavy trucks and road trains during the curfew hours in Footscray and to fulfil their commitment to transport material for the West Gate Tunnel project by rail. I also call upon the federal government to pressure their Labor colleagues to take these actions, to introduce tough new federal pollution standards for heavy vehicles and to put in place measures to rapidly shift freight transport to rail and to hydrogen and electric trucks to help my fellow residents of the inner west of Melbourne and, indeed, people across the country to live safe and healthy lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've done many times in this place, I would like to talk about the crucial need to raise income support, particularly after hearing evidence from our latest poverty inquiry hearing. Being forced to live in your car or in a tent while your government delivers tax cuts to those on over $200,000 a year is not okay, but this is the reality for those hit hardest by the Lismore floods. I recently visited Lismore to chair the fifth hearing of the yearlong Senate inquiry into the extent and nature of poverty in Australia. Over 3,000 homes in the Lismore area were impacted by the 2022 floods, and more than one year on our inquiry heard harrowing reports of locals still camping in tents in their backyards, couch-surfing, or living in cars or in pod villages. We heard about the kindness and the care of strangers and community organisations who selflessly uplift those in need in the absence of government support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The resounding issue that has been raised in these inquiry hearings is meagre income support payments. The inquiry heard from Nimbin resident Chibo, who shared his experience over the last few years:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I must say, I've never felt so mentally tortured as when I was unemployed, starting with Centrelink treating you like you're the last dirt from the street. Just coming into the whole situation … really impacts on your lifestyle, on your nutrition level, on anything. As soon as something goes 'pop' which wasn't being calculated for, like if you have a car and you have one tyre problem or something, that's $50 to $150 … That just throws you out while you were maybe saving up for getting the fridge repaired or something. It is such a stressful state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Centrelink payments he added:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are really making people sick—that's my opinion—by having them on such a small amount of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we heard the same thing in Lismore as we've being hearing at every poverty inquiry hearing to date. People are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and they need help to make it through this cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who are still doing it tough: please know that we hear you and we'll continue to fight for you inside and outside the parliament. Between low wages, having no affordable housing, and starvation payments of around $47 a day for people on JobSeeker, communities across the country are facing dire financial circumstances. That is why the Greens are pushing Labor to invest $5 billion a year in public and affordable housing and to raise the rate of all income support payments to $88 a day in the May budget. We need action, not words. Poverty is a political choice—a choice that continues to be made by this Labor government. These people in our community have been punished by 10 years of a callous coalition government. As we saw in the budget last year, they will continue to be chastised by a Labor government who profess to speak for the people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am calling on Minister Rishworth, Treasurer Chalmers and the Labor government to financially support people who have been forced into poverty—forced into something that is out of their control. The government has the power and the ability to lift the rate of income support above the poverty line.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to note, in the time remaining, that Friday marks Tibetan Uprising Day, which commemorates the 1959 Tibetan uprising that ultimately resulted in a violent crackdown on Tibetan independence movements and in the flight of the Dalai Lama into exile. The Chinese government have continued their attacks on Tibetan people and culture to this day. Peaceful protests in Tibet have resulted in people being arrested, including monks. We have a broader pattern by the Chinese government of oppressive actions against Tibetan organisations and people. I've consistently noted my concerns about the disappearance of the Panchen Lama. I will continue to push, here in the Australian context, that we recognise only a Dalai Lama appointed by Tibetan Buddhist traditions and practices, without interference by the Chinese government. To the people of Tibet and to Tibetans around the world: we are in solidarity with you and with everyone facing injustice and human rights violations. We urgently urge the Chinese government to immediately cease its violations of human rights in Tibet, and we call upon the Australian government to advocate at the highest level for human rights in Tibet and around the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  I rise to speak this evening in relation to the Labor government's review of religious educational institutions and antidiscrimination laws, which, to be frank, has become an absolute car smash—an absolute train wreck. The evidence that was presented before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee during estimates was absolutely gobsmacking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I provide some particular comments in relation to the state the Labor government has gotten itself into with respect to this review, I first want to talk about the importance of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is one of the key individual freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of religion. It's a freedom that isn't just exercised by an individual. It's a freedom that is exercised in community, and it is well and truly accepted as a matter of international human rights law that people have a right, in community, to practise their religious faith freely. That includes religious schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament, I participated in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee's review of the proposed legislation from the Morrison government. During that process, my door was open, and it will always remain open to everyone who has views with respect to this issue. That committee conducted itself, in my opinion, in a very balanced and reasonable way, in obtaining the viewpoints of all stakeholders, as it should. Hence, it is extraordinarily disappointing to see the feedback that has been provided from people of faith in relation to the consultation paper issued by the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Religious </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ducational </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nstitutions and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nti-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">iscrimination </span><span style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aws</span>, released in January 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first want to refer to a media release issued by the National Catholic Education Commission. It should be noted that the National Catholic Education Commission's executive director, Jacinta Collins, served in this place for some 21 years. Whilst Jacinta Collins served on the other side of the aisle, I deeply respect her contribution to this place. One would reasonably expect that a person with that experience, when they go to print on matters like this, would do so having carefully considered the issues. The media release of 31 January 2023 is entitled: 'Proposed reforms to discrimination legislation would make it impossible for Catholic schools to be Catholic'. That's a media release from one of the largest providers of religious faith based schools in Australia. To quote further:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the National Catholic Education Commission meeting today, our educational leaders across Australia were very concerned by the narrow approach taken in the ALRC paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed reforms fail to provide real protections for religious schools to effectively operate and teach according to their religious beliefs and ethos …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Collins said the review has been limited to exemptions in the Sex Discrimination, Fair Work and other Acts and does not address the need for protections for religious rights in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Changes to anti-discrimination laws … must go hand-in-hand with proactive legislation to protect religious freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"International law recognises protections to establish religious educational institutions and the right of parents to choose a school for their children that is in line with their religious values and beliefs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"In a pluralist society, Catholic schools should be free to be Catholic," Ms Collins said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree wholeheartedly with that proposition, that Catholic schools should be free to be Catholic, just as Anglican schools should be free to be Anglican, Muslim schools should be free to be Muslim and Jewish schools should be free to be Jewish. That should be a fundamental, important basis for a pluralist society, bearing in mind that many people of many different faiths have come to this country. They've come to this country from lands where they couldn't practise their religious faith, whether individually or in communion. I again quote from the media release of the National Catholic Education Commission:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is an important tipping point for faith-based schools in Australia … We need to find a fair and reasonable balance to ensure staff and students are not discriminated against on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy, while enabling faith-based educational institutions to continue to express their faith identity, ethos and values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a very measured and balanced view with respect to this topic, the right of Catholic schools to be Catholic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsequently, another letter was received. This letter was sent to the Hon. Mark Dreyfus, our Attorney-General, from a range of faith leaders—again, with respect to the consultation paper. It was sent by the Right Reverend Dr Michael Stead, Anglican Bishop of South Sydney. It was co-signed by leaders of many faiths—the Catholic faith, the Anglican faith, the Greek Orthodox Church, Muslim schools, Presbyterians, Adventists, Australian Christian Churches. There were pages of signatories. This is what they say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Paper proposes that the right of religious schools to preference people of their faith in the selection of staff be strictly limited only to those teaching roles where the "<span style="font-style:italic;">teaching, observance, or practice of the religion is a genuine requirement of the role, ha</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ving regard to the nature and ethos of the institution</span>".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the ALRC consultation paper proposes. They then say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For every other teaching role, it would be become unlawful for the school to give preference to employing teachers who share or are willing to commit to supporting the religious beliefs of the school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they go on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Faith-based schools in Australia have long been free to give preference to employing staff who share or who are willing to support the faith and beliefs according to which the school is conducted. They do not seek the right to discriminate on the basis of a protected attribute, but simply to be able to employ staff who share or are willing to uphold the religious beliefs of the school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's unreasonable about that? That's balance, from my perspective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has brought these faith leaders, education leaders, to write in these terms? It's the fact that they consider the Australian Law Reform Commission paper, which was released in January 2023, is not a balanced document. It's not a balanced document, and it stands, in my view, in stark contrast to the religious freedom review that was the report of a panel of five experts—not one expert but five experts—including the current president of the Human Rights Commission. During Senate estimates I was told: 'Senator Scarr, it's a consultation paper. We're getting feedback on the consultation. Isn't that how it's meant to work?' The problem is that, when you start from this point, the religious faith leaders, important stakeholders in our community, now have absolutely no confidence in the process. It has become a train wreck. They have no confidence in the process. This is the starting point. It appears like a fait accompli, and so they've lost faith in the process. The letter from the religious faith leaders dated 13 February 2023 to the Hon. Mark Dreyfus MP said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Having carefully considered the proposals in the Consultation Paper we are doubtful that the ALRC process can reach any balanced outcomes, as contemplated by the terms of reference, by starting with these proposals. We agree with the comments from the National Catholic Education Commission that the proposed reforms fail to provide real protections for religious schools to effectively operate and teach according to their religious beliefs and ethos, and that if the proposed reforms were adopted it would be a major blow to authentic faith-based education in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the situation we're now in because the Labor Party embarked on a consultation process which was a farce. They started with a fait accompli and the consultation—I call it 'consultation'; it has been very direct consultation—process has failed. This will be an albatross around the neck of the Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus.</span>

The Therapeutic Goods Administration, our TGA, did not check patient-level clinical trial data for the mRNA vaccines. Instead, it used documents that Pfizer supplied and modified after the United States Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, requested it. It's now very relevant to ask: how diligent was America's Food and Drug Administration, the FDA—that's America's equivalent of our TGA—in overseeing drug approvals?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 2 November 2021 the <span style="font-style:italic;">British Medical Journal</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">BMJ</span>, published an article titled 'Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer's vaccine trial'. I'll quote from this article about whistleblower Brook Jackson reporting on the Texas trial sites:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told <span style="font-style:italic;">The BMJ</span> that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration. Ventavia fired her later the same day. Jackson has provided <span style="font-style:italic;">The BMJ</span> with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These were provided to substantiate her allegations. Brook Jackson used FDA whistleblower provisions—and a lot of good that did her, because the FDA dobbed her in to Pfizer anyway. She was fired, and her complaint was ignored—start of cover-up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, on 16 November 2022 the <span style="font-style:italic;">British Medical Journal</span> published an article titled 'FDA oversight of clinical trials is "grossly inadequate", say experts'. In recent months a court ordered release of documents surrounding the FDA's approval of Pfizer's vaccine confirmed Pfizer's malfeasance. The documents are known as the 'Pfizer papers', the FDA contested their release to the public. It wanted this information kept secret for 75 years. The Pfizer papers show the FDA knew or reasonably should have known at the time of approval that the clinical trials were incapable of supporting an approval. Let me say that again: the Pfizer papers show the FDA knew or reasonably should have known at the time of approval that the clinical trials were incapable of supporting an approval.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pfizer then did this: their USA and European trial sites were getting so many adverse reactions that Pfizer had to cheat and at the last moment added 26 new trial sites in Argentina, recruiting 467 doctors almost overnight to create 44,000 new glowing patient records, overwhelming the legitimate bad data. In Argentina some sites and many patients do not appear to exist. Adverse events were hidden, and patients who were harmed or killed were removed from the data. That's what the United States Food and Drug Administration rubberstamped, and that's exactly what the TGA rubberstamped. And now every day Australians are dying.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know people are tired of this whole thing. One Nation is as well, yet there is a far larger issue that has gone without comment, that is too monstrous to simply let go. It relates to why the TGA refused to have anything to do with an Australian developed conventional attenuated virus vaccine that would have been safe to use. Queensland university discontinued their conventional vaccines on spurious grounds with real conflicts of interest. This opened the door for an entirely new class of drugs and supposed vaccines, mRNA, medicine by gene editing. This was not about Australian patient health; it was about patents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 15 years 47 market-leading drugs have aged out of patent, costing pharmaceutical companies $30 billion a year in lost sales, including drugs that made up to 42 per cent of Pfizer's drug revenue and 62 per cent of AstraZeneca's drug revenue. This patent cliff is set to get worse, with another 15 drugs—nine of the world's 20 top-selling drugs—due to expire this decade. Pfizer will face losing another $15 billion in annual sales. The only way to replace so much revenue is with a whole new class of drug: mRNA. Four hundred mRNA drugs are currently in development. The manufacturing plants in Australia are already under construction, before the drugs have been tested. The problem for big pharma was how to get these radical gene-editing drugs accepted. Coincidentally, along came COVID—a miraculous opportunity to use the new, untested mRNA gene editing. The heavens aligned to wave mRNA technology through for humans and animals, untested, with no debate or scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have an explosion of patient death reports and patient harm reports on the database of adverse events notifications, including 940 deaths before doctors gave in to Ahpra's blackmail and stopped reporting vaccine or injection deaths. The actual deaths from COVID-19 injections are known to be grossly underreported due to Ahpra's threats to doctors and nurses. In 2022 there were 22,000 more Australian deaths than usual, and our health bureaucrats can't tell us why. Half are unexplained, and the other half are supposedly people for whom the mRNA vaccines did nothing—but led to their death. Yet the pharmaceutical industry's future is now secure for a generation. That, Minister, is a crime this government refuses to investigate. Health bureaucrats' lies and government deceit directly and indirectly killed thousands of people. Thousands of Australians are dead. Bureaucrats' lies destroyed millions of lives and livelihoods. Unless the Albanese government takes prompt action it will be complicit with the Morrison government's crime. One Nation calls on the government to immediately enact a Senate select committee inquiry to identify the scope and terms of reference for a royal commission into state and federal governments' gross mismanagement of COVID.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:42</span>):  If there's one thing I've learnt in my 3½ years of being a senator it's that, if anyone thinks that this country is being run by the people in this chamber or in the other place, they are kidding themselves. It is run by the bureaucrats. Let's be honest: that's much too nice a term; they're really autocrats. These people are accountable to no-one. We've been fooled with this Orwellian language that they're an independent statutory authority and, because they're independent, they're going to be pure as driven snow. I don't think I've been to a set of estimates yet in the last 3½ years where I've ever had a bureaucrat actually come out and give me a straight answer. Quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of it, so tonight's all about the last set of estimates and the number of lies that were told by Dr John Skerritt. I'm going to go through those lies bit by bit, right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is a real doozy. When asked by Senator Roberts whether or not he would apologise to the people who died from the vaccine, Dr Skerritt said that since the beginning of the COVID pandemic more than 10 times as many people had died from paracetamol or Panadol as from adverse events due to COVID vaccines. We checked that out—</span>

                  </a>  I will continue. As I've just quoted, Professor Skerritt said there were 10 times as many deaths from paracetamol and Panadol as there were from the COVID vaccines. So, upon returning to my electorate office, I thought I'd check this particular quote out. It turns out there were only 52 deaths on the DAEN, the Database of Adverse Event Notifications, website since 1 January 2021, which is the same period that the COVID vaccines have been available. Twenty-four of those vaccine deaths were as a result of self-harm and nearly all of the remaining vaccines were in concurrence with other drugs. Given that there have been 975 reported deaths—and that varies between 975 and 978—according to Professor Skerritt there should have been 9,000 or so reported deaths from paracetamol. I note that Professor Skerritt is more than happy to take every reported death from paracetamol as an alleged death but not do the same for COVID vaccines, so he's also applying double standards. Whichever way you look at it it's an egregious statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing I wanted to pick him up on is a statement that I dispute or on a figure that was misleading was that, when I asked why he made a statement at a press conference that Moderna would provide 100 per cent protection from death, he insisted that he was quoting a study. I've gone back and I've looked again at the transcript from when he gave that press conference and this is exactly with what he said—he was referring to the release of the Moderna vaccine:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's highly efficacious. And of course, we can build on widespread global experience. So in the US alone, there has been over 140 million doses of Moderna used. The other really encouraging thing about Moderna is even after six months, it's proving to be 93 per cent efficacious against any infection, 98 per cent against severe disease and 100 per cent against death. And that's really exciting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's quoted from 140 million doses administered in the US. He was not quoting from a trial. So, again, I will say that he was definitely misleading. I would consider that, given I've raised this with him in questions on notice, he knew exactly what he was saying, and he shouldn't have said what he said. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that was particularly disturbing was that, when I asked why he didn't put a warning label on the vaccines to warn people who had antiphospholipid syndrome and advise them that the vaccines hadn't been tested for people with autoimmune diseases, he quoted a study from <span style="font-style:italic;">Rheumatology</span> magazine that effectively said that vaccines were safe for people with antiphospholipid syndrome. So I went and looked up that study in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rheumatology</span> magazine, and it turns out that that study was conducted on the Sinopharm vaccine—a Chinese vaccine—which is a protein vaccine. So that's completely different. Protein vaccines are completely different to mRNA vaccines. An important distinction is the fact that the mRNA vaccines are encased in a lipid nanoparticle, in which there are four lipids—an ionisable lipid, PEG, cholesterol and a phospholipid. Given that there are phospholipids in the vaccine and because the lipids actually cross the cell membrane—biochemistry students will know from Biochemistry 101 that the cell is a membrane made up of a lipid layer of phospholipids—the phospholipids around your cells are also impacted by this vaccine, because of the pathway it uses. So his quoting a study that relied on the Sinopharm protein vaccine and not the mRNA vaccine is again very misleading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question that was posed to him earlier in the afternoon was about whether or not cardiac arrests were a side effect of the vaccine. That was a question because Professor Skerritt admitted that you could have myocarditis from the vaccine, and it turns out that, in some cases, myocarditis can lead to cardiac arrests. It can cause a lot of lifetime pain. I was on the phone yesterday for 40 minutes to a doctor who was saying it's actually a subclinical condition. I had never heard that term before. What he said was it's like an iceberg. He said a lot of people don't experience any pain with myocarditis and then they'll suddenly pass away if they're not aware of the condition that they've got. That is unlike pericarditis, which is a heart muscle issue but actually has external pain, so you can feel it, and that's often the reason why people are going to the hospital—because they can feel that pain. Myocarditis can actually be subclinical, and you can't always feel it. To put a long story short, yet again, he has tried to downplay the risks of the vaccine by not acknowledging that cardiac arrests are a side effect of the vaccine; you can't say that myocarditis is but cardiac arrests aren't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one I'd like to refer to is a statement that he made about 12 months ago, but I think it's worth raising again. He said that the lipids in the vaccine are like the lipids that you eat in the sausages that you have for breakfast. It turns out that, in December last year, a very diligent and persistent lady managed to get an unredacted copy of the Pfizer non-clinical report, and we were fortunate enough to get pages 17, 18 and 19 unredacted. There's some interesting stuff in here. You've really got to ask yourself why it was redacted in the first place, given that it was particularly pertinent to the risks that this new vaccine had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is interesting is that, at the bottom of page 17 of the unredacted statement—and you won't see this on the website at TGA FOI 2389-6, because the unredacted version hasn't been put up yet, even though it should be—the Pfizer <span style="font-style:italic;">Nonclinical evaluation report</span> actually says that novel excipients are used in the vaccine. 'Novel' means new. So for Professor Skerritt to claim that the lipids used in the vaccine are the same as the sausages that you eat for breakfast is completely misleading, again. As his own document, submitted by Pfizer to the TGA, said, two lipids out of the four lipids in the vaccine—this is quite a complex biochemistry chemical arrangement here—are brand-new. So, yet again, why has he misled us about this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another statement that I asked about as well. This wasn't just Professor Skerritt; a number of people have said this. They said that the vaccine stays in the tops of your arms. If you go to page 44 of this particular document again, the Pfizer <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">onclinical evaluation report</span>, you will see that the concentration of lipids in just about all body organs was still increasing after day 2, before they stopped the trials. It doubled in the ovaries. The concentration of lipids in the ovaries doubled from day 1 to day 2. That in itself should have been a red flag, because women are born with one set of ovaries and they have one set of eggs in there. They're called oocytes. They stay with women throughout their lifetime. So, if it gets into the oocytes, that's going to cause problems down the track, I can assure you. Professor Skerritt replied that the concentration of lipids decreased in the body. But that wasn't the question that I asked. I asked why the concentration of lipids increased in various body organs. Yet again, he has deliberately misled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matters because it comes back to the whole point about the 978 reported deaths, of which the TGA claim only 14 have been a result of the vaccine. Professor Skerritt is trying to override these reports of deaths, of which approximately 70 per cent come from medical professionals and 50 per cent come from state governments. Given that Professor Skerritt and the TGA haven't examined the patients—haven't examined the body—and that in many cases autopsies haven't been done, why is he overriding the expert opinion of people who have actually examined the patient or the body before they passed away? If he can't tell the truth about all these other things, how do we know he's telling the truth about deaths reported to the TGA?</span>
