                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I first introduced this bill more than a year ago—in fact, on 27 November 2019—and it's sat on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> since then because, of course, this government, the Morrison government, does not want to deal with this issue. They don't want transparency around political donations. They want to continue the cover-up, and the recent release from the Australian Electoral Commission on the political donations for the financial year shows why: a $75,000 donation from Clive Palmer to the National Party. It's simply outrageous that the Nationals are accepting donation from Clive Palmer while he's funding his own political party. This government coalition is a coalition between Liberals, Nationals and Clive Palmer. And, because political parties were only required to disclose individual donations above $14,000 during the last financial year, we don't know whether Clive Palmer also made donations to the Liberal Party. He could have donated $13,999 and we wouldn't know about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also don't know which Liberal donors this government has done favours for. Last year we found out that the Leppington Pastoral Company had donated $58,000 to the Liberals and had been paid $30 million for a parcel of land worth, we found out, one-tenth that much. Just last week we found out that Peter Dutton had awarded an $880,000 grant to an organisation eight days after it made a donation of $1,500 to the LNP in support of Mr Dutton. How many other Liberal Party donors have won tenders, grants and approvals funded by taxpayers' money? We don't know because the system lacks transparency. How many donations are we not seeing because the threshold for disclosure is set so high, at $14,300?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor discloses all donations above $1,000. That's our policy and that is what we think all parties should be doing so that donations are transparent and there for all to see. That's why we've introduced this bill, and that's exactly what this bill does. All donations over $1,000 would need to be disclosed. That would mean that the Australian public would actually get to see who is funding political parties, not just a tiny piece of the puzzle. With the lower threshold, a whole heap of donations would come to light. There would be greater media scrutiny and reporting of donations, which would mean greater transparency and more information for voters as they went to cast their vote. This can only be good for the democratic process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federally, we have some of the worst disclosure laws in the country. We're lagging behind the states and territories. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and the ACT all require donations over $1,000 to be disclosed. Western Australia requires the disclosure of donations over $2,500, and South Australia requires donations over $5,000 to be disclosed. All of them are lower than the federal requirements. We can do, and should be doing, better and we have done better in the past. It will not surprise Senator Dean Smith over there to know that it was a Labor government that first introduced a federal donations disclosure regime. That was nearly 40 years ago, in 1983, under the prime ministership of Bob Hawke. All donations above $1,000 were required to be disclosed. In 2006, though, the Liberals, under John Howard, jacked this back up to $10,000 and linked it to CPI. This indexation has caused it to blow out to the current figure of $14,300 for the 2021 year. That's why this bill also removes indexation of the threshold so that it won't increase every year as it does currently. It will be fixed from now into the future at $1,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would the Liberals massively increase the disclosure threshold unless they wanted to hide the donations they were receiving? They will tell you it's about privacy—that the people who want to donate don't want their names published. But it's not mum-and-dad donors who donate more than $1,000 in one year. If people choose to donate more than that then they ought to be transparent about that donation. Under Labor's proposals the privacy of small donors will still be protected, but a light will be shone on those seeking to influence policy and government decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals will also tell you that they don't want to lower the threshold because of the increased compliance burden for these parties—that it's too difficult and too much effort for political parties to fill in the paperwork. Obviously, with a greater number of donations to declare, there will be a greater amount of work, but transparency and accountability are worth the extra effort, and democracy itself is worth it. If that means providing additional public funding to parties and candidates to ensure their compliance then we should be having a conversation about that too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The release two weeks ago of the donations data also highlights how extraordinarily long it takes the Australian public to find out about the donations political parties have received. It took over 10 months for Australian voters to find out that Clive Palmer had been donating to the National Party. If a donation is made on 1 July, the soonest we can find out about it is 19 months later. It's a bit better if a donation is made on 30 June; then it's only seven months to find out about that donation. That is, quite frankly, ridiculous and utterly unacceptable and is why Labor has another bill before the Senate which would require donations above the threshold to be disclosed within seven days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Liberal Party are able to accept donations and keep them secret for 19 months, that means they've got all the time to give grants, award tenders and do dodgy land deals before anyone finds out about them, and we know that that's what they've been doing, of course. If the Liberal Party is able to accept donations and keep them secret for 19 months then it means that voters don't have the information when they're casting their vote in a polling booth and simply can't hold the Morrison government to account. Our bill for real-time disclosure would also aggregate donations so that, as soon as the total of the donations from a single donor reaches the disclosure threshold, the party would need to disclose all subsequent donations from that donor no matter what their value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that transparency is the key to preventing and identifying corruption. That's why we've been driving Labor's reform agenda. It's Labor, not the government or the Greens, who has been driving the agenda for political donation reform, transparency and government accountability. It was Labor who fought for the ban on political donations. The Liberal Party didn't want to stop taking donations from foreign sources, despite the risk of foreign influence to our democracy. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming into accepting our amendments. It was Labor who protected charities and not-for-profits from government legislation that sought to silence and suppress their political advocacy. It was Labor who ensured that public election funding was linked to campaign expenditure, preventing candidates and parties from profiting from the electoral system. It is Labor again who's fighting for a powerful and independent integrity commission. Where is the government's promised Integrity Commission? We have seen delay after delay, because this government and this Prime Minister don't believe in integrity or accountability in government. It is a constant battle to get this government to come to the table on integrity reforms, and it is a battle to stop it eroding democracy with draconian measures designed to suppress the vote and silence their critics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from Senator McGrath's recommendation as the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that the Liberals want to introduce voter ID laws, potentially disenfranchising our most vulnerable Australians; abolish compulsory full-preferential voting, undermining our compulsory voting system; and introduce increased restrictions for charities and not-for-profits, making it harder for them to engage in political advocacy. We will be fighting all of those changes, if the Liberals try to introduce legislation before the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want honesty in government, but they've received the opposite from the coalition. We've had the sports rorts, the community grants rorts and now the safe seats rorts. Are there any grant programs that they won't rort? The Morrison government expects everyone else to play by the rules but thinks that the rules don't apply to it. They want to restrict the abilities of charities to fundraise and restrict their ability to campaign on issues that affect the most vulnerable people in our society. But the government's happy to receive donations from wealthy vested interests and happy with the rules that let it keep those donations secret for as long as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is on the side of accountability and transparency in government. That's what our reforms are designed to achieve. The government know who is donating to them and what they're getting for it. It's information they can use which is hidden from us, the media and the public. Doing a favour for a donor is obviously wrong. It raises questions. But it's not obvious if no-one can see it. We cannot question what we do not know about. We have to trust the government not to take advantage of its position. Given the rorting by this government, you will forgive me for not trusting it. Australians should know about political donations. They should know before they vote, not months—to close to two years—later. With our two bills, that is what is going to happen. Lowering the disclosure threshold is something we can do right now to immediately improve transparency. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  Today I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Transparency Measures—Lowering the Disclosure Threshold) Bill 2019, introduced as a private senator's bill by Senator Farrell. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I am pleased to make a contribution to this debate. Senator Farrell's bill proposes to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 regarding the amount at which disclosure of political donations is required. It claims that amending the act will restore the integrity of our democracy, but what it will actually do is place an unnecessary administrative burden on political parties and increase the red-tape load disproportionately to the amounts being donated. Don't forget: political parties are largely volunteer-run organisations. Do we want to tie our hardworking volunteers up with even more red tape? A disclosure threshold as low as $1,000 could pick up donations or spending by very small groups such as neighbourhood associations, RSL branches, sporting clubs and other small players who comment favourably or adversely on a federal politician or federal party. It would be unreasonable to expect the smallest donors, like your local footy club, to report with the same intensity as major players. Those donors have only limited financial means, and, while their interest in politics may be only at a peripheral or hobbyist level, we do not want to discourage that interest or their willingness to donate to a political cause. Diversity in donors encourages diversity in views, making our political landscape more representative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to strike a balance that ensures transparency for the largest political donations while protecting the democratic freedom and privacy of smaller players. A disclosure threshold that is set too low will mean a loss of privacy, which in turn compromises the ability to freely sponsor participants in public debate. This bill throws up potential consequences, in that it could expose a person to harassment. Aspiring politicians may shy away from further political participation as a result. Privacy rights should not be traded away so lightly. Consider the harassment tactics that have become popular with political activists in recent years. Personal attacks, particularly via social media, have become so commonplace now. We heard harrowing evidence of this during our hearings into the 2019 election campaign. In an environment where such behaviour is becoming accepted as the norm, there is an even greater need to be cautious about aggressive campaigns that demand greater disclosure of political beliefs. Small businesses, which make up the majority of the Australian business landscape, are often owned by the same person who serves you at the counter, who does the books and who markets their operation. They are likely time poor. If they are to donate to support a candidate or political party who champions their values, they do not want that act to be arduous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the red-tape issue, small businesses are particularly susceptible to 'cancel culture' intimidation. Word-of-mouth is a key marketing tool for small businesses, but negative word-of-mouth can cost these small operations dearly. This means they might decide not to make a political donation, for fear of harassment or intimidation. A low donation threshold would take away the platform for the diverse opinions that are otherwise heard in public debate today. Many of these opinions come from small players like mum-and-dad small businesses and local sporting groups. We don't want to silence their voices. We want these players to have a say in Australian public debate. This bill is such a blunt instrument that it not only proposes to lower the cap but it also does away with indexation of the disclosure threshold, by proposing repeal of section 321A of the Electoral Act. This would mean that the $1,000 threshold would be frozen in nominal terms, effectively lowering the cap each year. Thousands more Australians would therefore be caught in the red-tape-reporting net as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has already implemented several reforms to improve the integrity of the electoral system. These include prohibiting foreign political donations, including those from foreign governments and state owned enterprises, from being used to finance public debate; limiting public election funding to demonstrated electoral spending that can be substantiated by receipts; requiring public reporting by key non-party players, like left-wing organisation GetUp; applying the electoral authorisation requirements to modern communication channels, like SMSs; increasing funding for the Australian Electoral Commission to use electronic certified lists of electors, to guard against electoral fraud and ensure that absentee voters have their votes counted in the right electorate; funding modernisation of the AEC's Transparency Register to make it easier to locate and extract data; and making it mandatory for an election candidate to complete a qualification checklist to show they are entitled to run for election to parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We explored the topic of electoral processes and procedures and clarified the relationship between federal, state and territory electoral finance laws just a few months ago in this place, when the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020 was debated. That bill acknowledged that the legislation around elections and referendums held in Australia could be clearer. It also showed how electoral processes could be enhanced and modernised to allow for greater flexibility within the Australian Electoral Commission. More clarity and streamlined election delivery strengthens our electoral integrity and builds confidence in our voting system. To achieve this clarity, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020 amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. In amending the Electoral Act, it clarified donation and disclosure laws relating to the relationship between federal electoral events and those in the states and territories. This followed the 2019 High Court decision of Spence v State of Queensland and reflected the High Court's findings about the exact limits of the Commonwealth's legislative power. The miscellaneous measures bill also provided greater clarity around the relationship between federal, state and territory electoral laws to improve certainty for those who participated in elections across different levels of government. Individuals and entities are subject to different electoral funding and disclosure laws across federal, state and territory jurisdictions, leading to confusion and potentially costly or unlawful errors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After each federal election, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters conducts a review into the election. As a first time member of that committee but a long-time volunteer involved in both state and federal campaigns, I found the process enlightening. Naturally, there are always going to be different views from all sides of politics, and we need to ensure that recommendations made and acted upon improve the outcome for the people of Australia. I'm certain that the committee's chair, Senator McGrath, will elaborate on many of the 27 recommendations made from that inquiry during his contribution later today; however, I want to mention just a few that I believe will provide further confidence in the election process for our community. The first of those is the need to identify voters when they present at a polling booth. With a background in banking, where privacy and security are paramount, I have never understood how anyone can simply walk into a polling booth, state their name and address and be accepted in good faith. Who is to say that they haven't been into every polling booth in the neighbourhood and voted on behalf of their family, their neighbours and anyone else they know the details of? In today's world you're asked to verify your identity in almost every aspect of life using PINs, thumbprints or fingerprints and, yes, occasionally even signatures on a regular basis. Why should voting be any different? Further to this, the chair's report also recommended that the electoral roll be strengthened to ensure only those with photo ID or other forms of suitable ID can enrol or change enrolment. This is a simple no-brainer to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other recommendations included broadening the test for affiliated organisations, exploring the possibility of introducing an electronic certified roll, replacing compulsory preferential voting with optional preferential voting, and introducing the Tasmanian initiative the Robson rotation for ordering candidates on ballot papers for the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further opportunity to gain insight into the transparency and accountability around political donations and disclosure is currently underway, with the current Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters reporting later this year on its review on the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act 2018. This review commenced on the second anniversary of the royal assent of the bill and will allow us to understand the impacts of the amendments made at that time while also providing an opportunity for further community consultation on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that we maintain a balanced approach when it comes to political donations. Yes, we need transparency for the largest political donations, but we also need to protect the democratic freedom and privacy of smaller players. This bill seeks to introduce a disclosure threshold so low that it will rob small donors of their privacy and drive them out of political life. A balanced disclosure regime is one that allows political participation by all Australians. The current disclosure threshold appropriately balances red tape, political participation and transparency of the electoral system. Therefore I call on the Senate to reject this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Transparency Measures—Lowering the Disclosure Threshold) Bill 2019. This is a bill that would lower the disclosure threshold for donations to political parties to $1,000. That is a noble outcome, but I'm extremely disappointed that, whilst we are debating this bill today, the Labor Party are not bringing this bill on for a vote. They could have done so. The Senate could have voted this through. The Greens certainly would have supported it, and we do support it. It is a bare minimum reform but it is a start. I am extremely disheartened that there seems to be an attempt to be seen to be doing something without actually doing the thing. I call on Labor to rethink their plans to not move this bill for a vote, because, surely, when private senators' time is so scarce, we should use those opportunities to pass good laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will talk about how this bill could be further improved, but the major point here is: it is great that we are debating reform, but why not bring it on for a vote? We know the government don't even want to be seen to be doing anything, let alone actually do something, but to have this chance to push them to a vote and to not do so is baffling to me and incredibly disheartening to the Australian population who want reform in this space. They are sick of their democracy being perceived as for sale, so this is a bare minimum reform. Lowering the disclosure threshold is the least we could do to clean up the influence of big money on politics. It wouldn't remove the influence of that money but it would at least have some transparency over the process. But, after today, we still won't have that because Labor are not bringing this bill on for a vote. So one wonders, frankly, about the point of even debating this if you are not going to move it to a vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure everybody knows that big money continues to corrupt our democracy and prioritises private interests over the public interest and over the interests of the broader constituency and people. Figures disclosed last Monday by the Electoral Commission show that, in 2019, nearly $170 million was donated to political parties, and the majority of that money came from just five big donors. The alarming thing is the trend here. Between the 2016 and the 2019 elections, the amount of money that was donated tripled. So the problem of private money buying political parties and funding their re-election campaigns is getting worse. It has become three times worse between the last two elections, and these are just the donations that we do know about—I will talk a bit about dark money in a moment. This is a particularly concerning trajectory, particularly since we are staring down the barrel of the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The usual suspects like the gambling industry, fossil fuels, pharmaceuticals and the banking sector have continued to give very generously, and they have been rewarded with grants, with contracts, with advantageous policy outcomes—or advantageous policy inaction, in the case of the climate crisis. To give just a few examples, the guy whose box factory opening kept the Prime Minister from an international climate summit, Mr Anthony Pratt, donated $1.55 million to the coalition through Pratt Holdings. And Pratt's company, Visy, ended up with a $10 million bushfire recovery grant and now a recycling export ban that strengthens their market dominance. The biggest five fossil fuel giants—Woodside, Santos, Rio Tinto, BHP and Peabody—collectively gave around $10 million to the major parties and to lobby groups in 2019-20. Is it any wonder that we see government paralysis on the climate crisis and this continued fiction of a gas led recovery?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chevron paid no tax on their Australian earnings, but they somehow managed to find $92,000 to donate to the major parties. Crown, who you'll hear a lot more about this week, gave almost $146,000 to the major parties in 2019-20 and they have given $2 million since the year 2000. Given the evidence in the Bergin report just last week about criminal involvement and money-laundering allegations, it really is incumbent upon both big parties to give that money back or, better still, to give it to a gambling support service and charity, and we'll be talking about that later today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have more examples of big money buying big outcomes. The big four accounting firms donated $400,000 to the big parties. Over that same period they got themselves almost $600 million in government contracts. That's a pretty good return on investment. After a brief hiatus during the banking royal commission, the big banks have resumed donating. The banks, the financial lobby groups and the major insurance and credit firms delivered over $900,000 to the government in 2019-20. That wouldn't possibly have anything to do with the efforts to relax responsible-lending laws now, would it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have consistently advocated for lowering not just the disclosure threshold but the amount that people, organisations, companies and unions—anybody—are permitted to donate to a political party. We'd like to see bans on particular industries that have a demonstrated history of seeking influence on policymaking. We don't think they should be allowed to donate at all. But at the very least we think that there should be a cap of $1,000 per year on how much you—no matter who you are—can donate to the big political parties. This would level the playing field. This small modest amount, hopefully, isn't enough to buy influence. It would still be constitutional and allow people to express their desires to support a particular party. Big money should not be running our political system. At the moment it's running rife. It got worse over the last election period. This bill attempts to do the barest minimum of reforms, and we're not even going to get to vote on it today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Real-time disclosure is another issue. We've that in Queensland now. This bill doesn't address speeding up the disclosure time frame. There's a lag of up to 19 months before the public learns who donated what to whom. That delay doesn't help transparency. In fact, it hides possible policy outcomes that may have been obtained from that donating. So we need a rigorous real-time disclosure regime and we need to properly address this issue of dark money not just by lowering the disclosure threshold but by treating as political donations things like membership fees, fundraising dinner fees and the cosy lunches and dinners where you pay a squillion dollars to sit next to the minister and speak in her or his ear. We need to treat all of that as political donations to get some transparency and accountability in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we support lowering the disclosure threshold to $1,000. Whilst this improves transparency, it doesn't remove the influence of that money. Greater transparency would give information but it would still take up to 19 months to disclose. It will tell us who's buying our democracy but not in a timely manner and it won't stop it being for sale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw a report this morning that the extent of dark money is off the charts. Some 40 per cent of the money received by the coalition falls into the category where they don't need to disclose who's giving them that money. It's called dark money because it either falls under the disclosure threshold or is in a category where you don't otherwise have to disclose. It includes things like fundraising dinners, membership subscriptions and donations from support bodies that are affiliated with the party. Dark money is a huge problem. Some 40 per cent of the coalition's funds are dark money and I think 27.7 per cent of Labor's funds are dark money. So, while lowering the disclosure threshold will address some of that, it still leaves those other categories unregulated. We have the chance to fix that, and we should be doing exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill doesn't capture membership fees. It doesn't capture subscriptions or attendance at fundraising events. It doesn't lift the curtain on those holding companies and foundations that warehouse donations. So, without that reform, significant sources of campaign income will remain hidden. This bill also doesn't stop government grants and contracts from going to donors. It doesn't prevent companies from applying for government approvals while donating and donating while their applications are being assessed. In recent years we've seen a litany of examples of companies, including Santos and Adani, making donations at around about the time their approvals were given. That is something that the Greens would like to reform as well. This bill doesn't impose any restrictions on the source of political donations. We've seen in the media this week the revelations about Crown. Clearly, accepting donations from organisations like Crown, which is now embroiled in criminal allegations and money-laundering allegations—it's just past tenable that any party would continue to receive or even retain donations from folk like Crown. The defence, pharmaceutical, mining, property development, banking and alcohol industries should also be explicitly prohibited from seeking to buy favourable outcomes through donations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, this bill doesn't put a cap on the total amount of donations that can be made. It doesn't bring forward that 19-month delay in disclosure. A few weeks ago—as, earlier today, Senator Farrell said when he spoke to this bill—the Labor Party were dismayed that Clive Palmer and his political party had made donations to the Nationals and generally spent an awful lot of money trying to buy electoral outcomes, either for themselves or for the coalition. But despite this outrage, which I note is lacking when it comes to fossil fuel donations and the influence that that industry seeks, just last week they sadly refused to vote for our motion calling for real-time disclosure and donation caps. They said the parliament needed to debate real reforms. Here we are debating some reforms, but you're not even bringing it to a vote. I think you're being hoist with your own petard. I therefore move a second reading amendment standing in my name on sheet 1194:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add: ", but the Senate notes that this bill should be complemented by reforms to: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) cap the total value of political donations that can be received by a political party, candidate, political campaigner or associated entity; and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) require more timely disclosure of political donations above the disclosure threshold".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is drafted in such a way that we hope people will be able to support it. I understand it has now been circulated in the chamber. This amendment calls for a cap on the amount of political donations that can be made. We would like it set at $1,000, but we're open to discussion. It also calls for a more timely disclosure of political donations so that we're not waiting for 19 months. Queensland manages real-time disclosure, and there is a variety of time frames that apply in different states. It can be done; it can be sped up. Let's have that conversation. As I'm an eternal optimist, I look forward to getting some support when the time comes for the second reading amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might flag one final point: were this bill to have gone to a vote, had the Labor Party sought to do so, we would have moved some committee stage amendments to address this point. We don't have that opportunity today, but we may have that opportunity in the future. Lowering the disclosure threshold will impose greater reporting requirements on third parties, and the term 'third party' is defined. The definition in section 287 means that an organisation becomes a third party when its spending on electoral matters is more than the disclosure threshold. If you were to be deemed a third party, you would therefore be subject to higher reporting requirements and, beyond just the disclosure of those same donations, there would be additional obligations that would flow. We are concerned, as we always have been, that that might deter smaller organisations from advocating on important political issues during election campaigns—I'm thinking in particular of environmental organisation, given that's my background. This is a very readily fixed issue, simply by decoupling the definition of 'third party' from the disclosure threshold and instead tying it to an amount of electoral expenditure. I understand this issue is before JSCEM, which I sit on, and will probably be addressed in the review of the electoral funding and disclosure reform, or EFDR, bill. We look forward to, hopefully, having a consensus workable solution on that matter. But I wanted to place on record that we're aware of the issue and keen to see it addressed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had an opportunity here today to debate donations reform. There is such a long list of reforms that are needed. Yes, we need to lower the disclosure threshold, but we've got to cap the amount that people can donate. We've got to make sure that that disclosure happens as quickly as possible. We've got to capture all that dark money by making sure that memberships, fundraisers and those other uncategorised donations actually do have to be disclosed. People have a right to know who is seeking to buy influence, and, frankly, people have a right to a system that is free from being able to be bought. That's why we'd like to see a cap on the amount of donations that can be made to political parties, and a level playing field. No matter who you are, that cap should apply. Individuals, unions, companies, vested interests, lobby groups—you name it. Let's get the influence of big money out of our politics and out of our democracy. This isn't America. Our democracy shouldn't be for sale to the highest bidder. We should be guided by evidence and by the public interest in making decisions, not by who just took you out to lunch and promised to make a motza of a contribution to get you re-elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve that reform. Momentum is building for that reform. The Greens have been pushing for this for 10 years now—that seems to be about the time frame it has taken for other things to get done. It took us 10 years before a federal ICAC was at least agreed to in principle by big political parties. Of course we're yet to see one, but we continue to wait. So we will still be here pushing for reform of our political system, because people want their democracy back.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="16913" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  I've listened carefully to Senator Waters and Senator Farrell outlining their approaches to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Transparency Measures—Lowering the Disclosure Threshold) Bill 2019. I have to say I think there is largely agreement in the Australian community about what the nature of the problem is. There is largely agreement—apart from on the government side—that the influence of unregulated undisclosed money in politics is a deep problem for our political system and a deep problem for the level of trust that there is between people and their government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw, of course, in the last election Mr Clive Palmer—that disreputable businessman from Queensland—spending an enormous amount of money largely directed against the Labor Party. It was tens of millions of dollars across the country, spent in an entirely unaccountable and unprincipled way and directed to supporting—in particular in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia—the candidates that the Morrison government put forward in that election. We've seen scandals about donations being provided by companies and by organisations who later got grants from the Morrison government. People are, I think, entitled to have a deep level of scepticism about this government's commitment to a clean electoral system, to a balanced electoral system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you listen to Senator Waters, it is as if the impetus for electoral reform somehow comes from the Greens political party. It's as if they are the pure source of deep concern about the Australian electoral system and as if nobody else in the system, in the community or in academia has been talking about this issue for decade after decade. The Greens' interest in this area is welcome, though. I do think, having listened carefully to Senator Waters and looking at the Greens' policy position in this area, that they have some similar motivations but they get the answer quite wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do think that the bill that Senator Farrell has spoken to and dealt with offers the right answer to some very complex questions. It only deals with the questions that we've been outlining today. As Senator Waters says, there are other issues in the political system that we ought to be having regard to. So that's the Greens' position: right motivation, but I think they get the answers wrong. I think the Farrell bill is well worth this parliament supporting. But it does beg the question: what is the Morrison government's position about electoral reform? Well, it's two things. Firstly, it's, 'Nothing to see here; move on,' and, secondly, it's, 'How can we use this for our own partisan political advantage, to game the system?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course the regulation of political donations is fundamental to our democracy. Donations are a form of speech, in fact. The High Court has upheld that donations are a form of political communication. Who can donate, how they can donate and the process through which that is disclosed are fundamental for citizens' participation in democracy. The lesson has to be clear from the United States about where you end up going as a society and a community if you allow completely unregulated, undisclosable, not transparent money into the political system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, the laws around political donations are subject to two legal tests: firstly, does the law burden the implied freedom of political communication and, secondly, is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner compatible with a constitutionally prescribed system of responsible and representative government? The truth is that all regulation of political donations effectively burdens the freedom of political communication. The question is: when you regulate, is it appropriate and is it directed towards a legitimate end? We don't want an American-style system that preferences the constitutional rights of a wealthy few over the health of our whole political system, so what should be the legitimate ends of our system of electoral donations?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our system should prioritise accountability, transparency, integrity and equity. The purpose of regulation in this area should be to provide for a vibrant public sphere. It should be to provide for more voices of ordinary Australians in politics, not fewer. It should engage and encourage speech and donations by individuals and organisations that bring more people into the political system and don't force the voices of ordinary Australians out. I don't believe that our election system should be entirely publicly funded. That is a recipe, supported by some, that leads to a sort of dull centrism where the ordinary voices of Australians are locked out. There's a balance to be struck here between proper public funding and ensuring that political parties are able to participate effectively in the political system without being beholden to donations and supporting the rights of political parties to be supported, whether it's by $10 donations from individuals or larger donations from organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been engaged in this argument for many, many years, inside this parliament and outside of it. In 2012, the New South Wales government introduced laws that banned donations from any organisation or person who was not an enrolled voter in the state. It aggregated the electoral communications expenditure of parties and affiliated bodies such as unions under expenditure caps. So the Liberal Party in New South Wales did in its interests what the Greens would like to do in their interests if they were ever in charge: they abolished the capacity of their political opponents to participate in the system. That's what they did. They made it unlawful for unions and community organisations—environment organisations, neighbourhood organisations—to participate in the political system. I supported the Unions New South Wales case, which went to the High Court, which ultimately kicked out the O'Farrell legislation and turned down the New South Wales government on the basis that I described. It was not a legitimate end that the government sought; it was a political end that the government sought for its own political advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is quite some history to the labour movement's engagement in politics in this country. Most of our modern political history was shaped by the labour movement and the Labor Party participating in politics. Almost all of the good things that have happened in modern Australian history have happened as a result of the labour movement and the Labor Party's participation; and people, when considering their approach to donations, ought to have regard to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Nurses and Midwives Association want to use their resources in the lead-up to an election to campaign on nurse-to-patient ratios in a way that's openly declared, spending perhaps millions of dollars worth of members' money, who on earth are a group of politicians to tell them that that ought to be regulated out of existence? If the AMWU want to fight for locally built trains and apprenticeships, if the ASU want to fight for proper funding for better funded domestic violence services, or if the SDA or the United Workers Union want to fight for penalty rates in hospitality and retail, that's what we want in the political system. We want more people making the argument, bringing the argument home, but the Greens bill would see those voices silenced, in many respects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first meeting of the New South Wales Labor Party—I always say the New South Wales Labor Party; I don't want to upset my Queensland colleagues—was on 4 April 1891 at the Unity Hall Hotel in Balmain. That pub is still there. The Balmain Labor Electoral League accepted a donation from the dock workers union, which paid for the registration of all of the Labor league candidates for that election. Our movement has survived for 130 years because of those institutional connections. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, the bill being offered this morning by the Greens is naive. It's partisan recklessness. Excluding individuals should be a product of careful and deliberate consultation, not a list of the people that you wish weren't participating in the public space. It's based on the proposition—I think by many people who approach this area of regulation—that, if all of these voices were removed, somehow the argument that had merit would rise to the top; somehow there would be this process where people would fairly consider the arguments. Well, the truth is that politics is shaped by institutional power, by a struggle for power and a struggle for winning propositions in the public sphere, and, whether your disagreement is with big mining or the finance industry, you can't legislate those people out of having some role. It is true that, where there is a nexus between pecuniary advantage and public policy, it is a legitimate end. For example, in the New South Wales system, I do think that there is a very strong argument for keeping property developers out of local and state government decision-making. That makes absolute sense. I think there is a community understanding that the tobacco industry ought not be engaged in that, given how closely related they are to health industry regulation. The case has to be made out, and it has to satisfy the test that the High Court set out for the parliament. I don't think the list that's provided does that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to spend a little bit of time, though, on the bill before us and the government's approach. Lowering disclosure thresholds is pretty fundamental. Our federal sphere has the weakest political donation laws of any jurisdiction. The disclosure threshold is entirely out of step with the states and the territories. In Queensland, it's $1,000; New South Wales, $1,000; Western Australia, $1,000; Victoria, $1,040, for some reason; the ACT, $1,000; and South Australia, $5,000. In the federal sphere, you can donate up to $14,300, and nobody will know. There is no aggregation. Multiple donations below the threshold can go unreported. As Senator Waters outlined to the chamber, that's why 40 per cent of the money received by the coalition parties to campaign in Australia is dark money—it is unreported, unaccountable, from individuals unknown. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a system where we are watching developments overseas and watching developments in our own jurisdiction with foreign interference, with big money getting involved in politics, with scandal after scandal here, rort after rort here and smug arrogance in the way this government treats government money as Liberal Party money, it is entirely proper that people look at that 40 per cent of Scott Morrison's electoral war chest—40 per cent of it; nearly half—when nobody knows where it's come from. Nobody knows who made those donations. Nobody knows which piper is calling the Morrison tune on any particular day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need proper electoral regulation in this country. We do need a National Integrity Commission to oversee the intersection between money and politics. We saw, just last week, Mr Dutton award a grant of nearly $900,000 to an organisation eight days after it donated to the Queensland Liberal National Party. He took a $36,000 chartered flight to Tasmania to announce a grant that he hadn't even awarded yet. This program wasn't Safer Communities; it was 'Safer Seats'! That's what Minister Dutton was engaged in. That's why people are sceptical about the role of money in politics, and that's why this place and the other place need to get with the program and get a decent system of electoral regulation so we can rebuild confidence in the system.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  The Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability is a historic opportunity for truth and justice. It was created as the result of a vast community campaign, spanning every section of our country, to create a mechanism by which we as disabled people would be able to tell our stories and to disclose the information that we have and the evidence we have gathered—speaking to the violence, speaking to the abuse, speaking to the exploitation and neglect of our community. It should be the case that every person who wishes to give that evidence to the commission is able to do so, their safety guaranteed—safe in the knowledge that giving that evidence, giving that information, sharing that story, will not in any way negatively impact on them. It will not jeopardise their future employment. It will not place them at risk of harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality, however, is that right now, due to a flaw in the law which creates and empowers royal commissions, that guarantee of protection, that guarantee of privacy, cannot be given. Right now, the confidentiality of information given to the commission as confidential only remains and is retained as confidential for the life of the royal commission. This means that, when the royal commission ends, the confidentiality protection ends. That information can be FOI'd. That information can be given as evidence. This flaw in the law removes people's confidence in the protection that is needed for them to come forward and tell their stories. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly harmful in a context where we know that, if you have experienced violence, abuse, exploitation or neglect, you have almost certainly experienced systemic failure. Somebody who was charged with your protection let you down, abused you. In order to get people to come forward and tell their stories, to give the evidence to guide the investigation of these systemic failures, people must be given the confidence that their confidentiality will be protected and that giving this evidence will not do them any harm, because disabled people have been telling our stories for many decades and we are often subject to harm because we've disclosed them. We are often dissuaded from giving our evidence, and it often has a negative impact. The outcome of this absence of protection is that the disability royal commission is not getting the evidence that it needs. It is not hearing the evidence that it needs to hear in order to guide its investigation so that it can make recommendations at the end of this process—having exposed the wrongs and the cover-ups—that we, as parliamentarians, need to form the basis of legislation, which will then eliminate from our society the violence against and the abuse and neglect of disabled people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For 18 months the government have known that this change is needed. At the very first hearing, the chair of the royal commission flagged that this change was needed. The commission then wrote to the government in February 2020 saying, 'This change is needed.' The commission stated clearly in its October interim report that the absence of these protections was serving as an impediment to the investigation, an impediment to this historic opportunity for justice. We Greens have been clear with the Morrison government: if you do not act, we will. We introduced this bill in October. We put the government on notice that this change was urgently needed. The government have failed to be forthcoming, so today this bill is being debated, and I hope it will be voted on and voted for by this chamber. It will, very simply, ensure that if evidence is given confidentially it is retained as confidential. It will provide safety and security to people giving their evidence so that they can begin the process of building up the support they need to tell their story, to come forward and say: 'This is what happened. This is who knew. This is who I tried to tell.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are so many people in the community who worked in governmental institutions—who still work in government—who have observed the profound failure to bring light into dark places, to ensure justice is done; instead, observing cover-up and silence. We know that there are people who want to tell their stories but have not done so because of the absence of these protections. This bill solves that problem. It sorts it, as it should have been sorted 18 months ago. I commend it to the chamber in the hope that it will be voted on and passed, and that finally disabled people will have the protection we need to tell our stories, to heal and to get justice.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  Can I first say how much I admire, and have admired since coming to this place more than 18 months ago, Senator Steele-John's passion with respect to this subject and his advocacy of this matter. I commend Senator Siewert as well, because I know she's had an integral part in maintaining the pressure, which absolutely had to be maintained, to establish the royal commission. I just want to place that on the record. We saw that passion on display once again today. I think it's fair to say that there'd be many Australians suffering under a disability today who look at you, Senator Steele-John, with great admiration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government agrees that there is a problem that needs to be fixed and needs to be fixed quickly, because it is absolutely essential that disabled people have an opportunity to tell their stories and that confidentiality should be maintained where it needs to be maintained. There is absolutely no question about that whatsoever. I commend Senator Steele-John for introducing this private member's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government did announce on 20 October last year—after, as I understand it, the private member's bill was introduced—that it was in the process of drafting legislation to address this very problem. It is hoped that that legislation is introduced in the autumn sittings of this parliament. As Senator Steele-John has said, it is really time critical that this legislation is introduced, because when this royal commission concludes its deliberations we must ensure that, where the confidentiality of those people who have made submissions to the royal commission is absolutely crucial, it is maintained on and from the date of the end of the royal commission. It's also important that the step be taken as soon as possible. The reason for that—and Senator Steele-John touched on this in his contribution—is that we need to send a message to everyone in the Australian community that the Australian government is aware of this issue; that all members of this Senate, including Senator Steele-John, are aware of this issue; that this issue needs to be addressed; and that this issue will be addressed. I'm happy to stand behind that statement I've just made on the record—it will be addressed before the royal commission comes to an end. So, if you have a story to tell the royal commission, please tell your story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparation for this debate I read the interim report from the royal commission, which was released towards the end of last year. I want to read a quote from the front of the interim report which stands out, because I think it really sums up this debate and goes to the crux of why it is so important. The quote that introduces the interim report is, 'What is happening to people is not okay and the stories need to be told.' I commend the chair of the royal commission and the six commissioners for the work they've done, and I note that one of the commissioners, the Hon. Roslyn Atkinson AO, served with distinction in the Supreme Court of Queensland. I congratulate the Hon. Ronald Sackville and all of the other six commissioners: the Hon. Ros Atkinson, of my home state; Ms Barbara Bennett; Dr Rhonda Galbally; Ms Andrea Mason; Mr Alastair McEwin; and the Hon. John Ryan for the work which they've done. It is quite incredible that they've so far received 1,928 submissions, had 7,608 telephone conversations, issued 12 issue reports and received 468 responses—an outstanding response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take some time—and it's not happy reading—to read some of the case studies which have been drawn out in the interim report of the royal commission. I think in doing this we emphasise the need and the requirement for there to be confidentiality, because when I go through these case studies you'll see, Madam Acting Deputy President Fierravanti-Wells, the vulnerability of the people of which I will talk about in terms of reprisals and being disadvantaged or discriminated against because they told their story. In all of these cases there's a footnote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Names changed and some details removed to protect people's identities. Narrative based on a submission to the Royal Commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's quite clear on the face of these submissions that there is a need for confidentiality to be maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first case study, which is from the victim's perspective and by a lady who's given the name 'Jane', reads that Jane:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By the time Jane was in her late teens, Maree was worn out because of lack of support. So she and her husband made the decision for Jane to live in a care home supported by a large agency. She describes it as a traumatic option but the only one possible at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maree told us that Jane was excited at the idea of living independently. But although Jane was very happy with the night and weekend staff, she had many issues with the day staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can try to put myself in the position of the parents of this daughter, Jane, and the angst that they went through when trying to work out what was best for Jane. They came to a decision that Jane needed to be given the opportunity to go into a care home supported by a large agency. They made that decision in good faith. But what they found was this: Jane's behaviour management plan was never followed. Jane was subject to humiliation, intimidation and bullying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maree complained to the day service staff and eventually to the general manager. Her emails went unanswered and she felt that staff avoided her. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, can one imagine the emotional turmoil that Maree, the mother, is going through at the treatment of her daughter Jane, and what Jane is going through?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In her submission Maree describes ringing one night to speak with Jane. The staff member who answered asked if the agency had been in touch regarding the 'critical incident'. Maree hadn't heard about it. Then Jane told her she had been sexually abused by a staff member. Maree told us that when she called the agency the next morning they asked, 'Oh you think that happened? Do you want us to get the police involved?' Maree was adamant that she did. Two weeks later Jane was interviewed by the police. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maree told us that in the 20 months it took for the case to go to trial, Jane was in a constant state of anxiety and the agency offered her no support. Jane developed a fear of new people supporting her. When new support people were introduced, she was scared of them and told Maree they were hurting her. Jane's behaviour escalated and police were called. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maree recounts in her submission that the staff member was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The prosecutor was surprised because it is 'quite rare for a person with a disability to win a case of abuse', as they are not considered reliable witnesses. However, the conviction was overturned on appeal. Maree told us she felt that a factor in this outcome was that Jane had to engage with a series of prosecutors who lacked understanding of autistic people, while the defendant had one lawyer for the entire process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maree says that Jane was left angry, fearful, anxious and distrusting, and behaved accordingly. She says the service provider suggested Jane would benefit from a stay in their lockdown facility to 'help people with challenging behaviours'. Maree wanted to see the facility and a behaviour management plan, but says this never happened. Instead, she says, they placed Jane there one weekend when they were short-staffed and suggested Jane have no contact with Maree or her favourite people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, can you imagine the emotional burden and toll this is taking on Maree, the mother of Jane, let alone what Jane was going through?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maree states that when, after 10 days, she was allowed to see Jane, she was appalled at the conditions – there was nothing to do and Jane had been denied her personal possessions. Maree believes 'this place, and how she was treated, has become a trigger to the fears and nightmares' Jane still experiences. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maree and her husband brought Jane home. Maree told us Jane was severely damaged by the experience and blamed Maree for sending her there. She said Jane was fearful of home support staff and reacted aggressively. </span>

During these attacks, which are like seizures and can last for hours, she requires incontinence pads, rails on the bed, a helmet and a wheelchair. 'This is a young woman who is normally very physically able and is continent,' says Maree. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the perspective of an employee. Employees are in particularly perilous positions if they turn whistleblower and disclose what is happening in a facility which they believe is untoward, unethical or inappropriate. They can be the subject of persecution in terms of their employment, but it can also affect their future opportunity to obtain employment, because future employers might say, 'Well, if they blew the whistle on that employer, maybe they might blow the whistle on me.' Lena is an employee. This is her story:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When Lena arrived for her first shift as a disability support worker in a day centre, she expected it to be as advertised. 'On paper the roster of programs looked fantastic,' she told us. Participants, some with high needs, could choose different activities … 'They should have been enjoying their life, but they weren't.' Instead she was confronted with 32 people, some restrained, some wearing face guard masks and some lying on the floor. There were only two staff and Lena was told to 'get on with it the best you can'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Toby's dad, Gavin, made a submission in which he described Toby's experiences in employment. Toby, who has moderate intellectual disability, knows kitchens. He had been working in different kitchens for businesses large and small for 15 years when he started a job in a hotel early last decade. Toby wasn't too bothered by the initial pranks … until what Gavin calls the 'bad stuff' started. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">What began as 'jokes' soon became unwelcome, prolonged, repetitive, intimidating and harassing. The attacks were mostly perpetrated by a particular chef, Chad, who was often left in charge. Gavin described just a few of these incidents. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another time they sprayed Toby's shaved head with oil and then set his head and T-shirt alight. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Chad told Toby he had to pay him $10 for every day he was kept in the job. Sometimes Toby paid, Gavin said, and, when he didn't, Chad would remind him he was keeping a total of how much Toby owed.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sometimes Chad and his mate would stand behind Toby, grabbing his buttocks and pushing their groin into his backside shouting obscenities. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">One time Chad and his mate took a large kitchen knife, made Toby close his eyes and dragged the blunt side along his arm. Next time, they promised, they would 'do it for real'. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the story of Toby and Gavin. I think their confidentiality needs to be protected. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have the story of Dev and Jana: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jana's son, Dev, has Williams syndrome, is autistic and has a mild intellectual disability. She told us that, in 2014, Dev was admitted to a children's hospital, where he was neglected by staff. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dev and Jana recount how the hospital and, in particular, certain doctors, failed to do what they needed to do in order to give Dev the attention he needed. Again, I think it is important that their confidentiality is protected, so that they can have access to the medical support which they need without anyone referring to the testimony which they have given to the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories go on and on and on and they are an absolute searing indictment not just of the individuals involved but of a system which has not been delivering what it ought be delivering to people with a disability in our country, living here in an advanced economy, a civilised nation. They certainly deserve better and, when their stories are told, they have every right to expect confidentiality, and I look forward to the government's legislation to give them exactly that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Royal Commissions Amendment (Confidentiality Protections) Bill 2020, and Labor will be supporting this bill. The bill will amend the Royal Commissions Act 1902 and make consequential amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to ensure ongoing confidentiality protections for people giving evidence to the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability. Currently, evidence that is received in private sessions conducted by the Disability Royal Commission is treated as confidential and is guaranteed to remain confidential after the commission's work is completed. However, the same privacy protections do not apply where evidence or information is received by the commission outside of a private session, even if prior to the evidence or information being given the commission indicated to the person providing the evidence or information that it would be treated as confidential and, after it was received by the commission, the material was, in fact, treated as confidential. It is quite astounding that such information will not be protected by privacy protections in the same way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disability advocates have argued persuasively that this may discourage some people from giving evidence to the disability royal commission. The amendments in this bill have been sought by disability advocates including the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and also by the chair of the disability royal commission, Ronald Sackville AO QC. In fact, it is difficult to find anyone who is opposed to these amendments. Last year, the Morrison government even announced that it would introduce similar legislation yet the Morrison government is so allergic to following through on its announcements that, as is almost invariably the case, it has done nothing. We will soon find out whether the Morrison government's aversion to following through on its announcements extends to voting against legislation that would do more than implement the government's own policy commitment, a truly bizarre situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: the disability royal commission is ongoing, and the amendments in this bill are likely to have a material impact on the willingness of people with disabilities to make submissions to the commission. There is no reason to delay the introduction of this relatively simple set of amendments, and there are plenty of reasons to expedite them. As we learned from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, it is critical that survivors of abuse in institutional settings be allowed to tell their stories in private and that requests for confidentiality be respected and backed by legislation; otherwise, many will not tell their stories at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 the Gillard Labor government amended the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to allow the chair of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse to authorise a fellow commissioner to hold a private session to receive information from victims and others affected by child sexual abuse. As the then Attorney-General said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A traditional royal commission hearing setting will not generally serve as the best way to facilitate participation in the royal commission by those people affected by child sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For many, telling their story will be deeply personal and traumatic. While we cannot know at this time how many people will wish to participate, sadly we know that this crime has affected many in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 8,000 personal stories were told to commissioners in private sessions during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Many others were able to tell their personal stories confidentially outside of private sessions, and they could do so because of the privacy protections that were inserted into the Royal Commissions Act and the Freedom of Information Act in relation to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, it is important to emphasise that the specific amendments in this bill are consistent with the privacy protections that applied to the child sexual abuse royal commission. Clearly the privacy protections that applied in relation to the child sexual abuse royal commission should also apply to the disability royal commission. That is what this bill seeks to achieve, and that's why we ask the government to support these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The privacy concerns driving the introduction of this bill are not the only issue that people with disability and advocates in the sector have raised in relation to this royal commission. The disability royal commission was established in April 2019, in response to community concern about widespread reports of violence against and the neglect, abuse and exploitation of people with a disability. It set out to investigate preventing and better protecting people with disability from experiencing violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation; achieving best practice in reporting, investigating and responding to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability; and promoting a more inclusive society that supports people with disability to be independent and live free from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government dragged its feet for two years before establishing the royal commission, which Labor first called for in 2017. It was finally announced in 2019, but only at the prospect of the government losing a vote on the floor of parliament. At the time, then Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have to recognise that while ever we are a nation who devalues people with a disability, then we will never actually get to the root cause of violence and the prevention of violence, abuse and neglect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the disability royal commission has been plagued by this government's continuing disinterest in the systemic problems that exist in Australia's disability frameworks. The terms set out by the disability royal commission are at risk of not being properly investigated while the Morrison government overlooks the basic requirements of people seeking to make a submission to the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the inquiry's establishment, Labor has called for the Morrison government to heed the calls of more than 60 disability advocacy groups and address the composition of the disability royal commission, to remove commissioners who have conflicts of interest and to replace them with people who have lived experience of disability and the support of the sector. The royal commission is inquiring into episodes that are highly sensitive as well as confronting for those affected. It is only appropriate that the commissioners be people who can hear such evidence objectively and without any perception that their consideration of this evidence be biased in any way. In 2019 the majority of the Senate supported a motion calling on the Morrison government to remove two of the commissioners and to replace them, with a set of positive criteria identified by the disability community. The Morrison government has ignored these concerns, and people with disability remain uncomfortable with making submissions to a royal commission overseen by former disability bureaucrats with real or perceived links to institutions of abuse and neglect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long people with disability have had to reiterate 'nothing about us without us'. These calls have been frustrated by this royal commission, which has heard from more experts and carers than it has witnesses with lived experience of disability. The vetting process of expert witnesses providing evidence has been questioned following the appearance of Mr Simon Wardale, who a coroner found, in relation to the death of a disabled woman under his care, fell into error by failing to remain alert to the possibility of a serious head injury and to act decisively. Mr Wardale appeared as an expert witness as part of last September's public hearings into the use of psychotropic medication, behaviour support and behaviours of concern. That he has been provided a platform to speak on behalf of people with a disability is unacceptable and raises serious concerns about the process used by the royal commission to invite witnesses to appear before it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often the reason people with disability fall prey to abuse can be directly linked to the inherent power imbalances that exist in treatment or carer-patient relationships. A royal commission investigating violence against—and then neglect, abuse and exploitation of—people with disability should therefore hear from people with disability first and foremost, and properly vetted experts and carers secondarily to supplement that evidence. Despite the issues with confidence in the disability royal commission, Labor supports the people with disability and advocates who continue to fight for ownership of the inquiry. The calls to action so far made by the disability royal commission have been constructive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2020, the royal commission issued a statement of concern that the federal government had not included people with disability in the emergency planning for the coronavirus response. In August, the royal commission held hearings into the experiences of people with disability during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, revealing that the Morrison government did not mention disability once in its first pandemic response plan. The hearings heard stories such as Ricky's, who's aged 45 and in Melbourne. He was forced to survive on muesli bars for nine days while bedridden without access to a support worker when coronavirus hit. What a way to treat our fellow Australians! The oversight of 4.4 million people in a national emergency is symptomatic of the struggle that Australians with disability face in a society that, without leadership from its government, continues to exclude and overlook them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the finding by the royal commission that it was a serious failure that no Australian government agency with responsibility for disability policy, including the Department of Health, made any significant effort to consult with people with disability or their representative organisations during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In its 560-page interim report, handed down in October 2020, the royal commission noted these attitudinal and communication barriers and the high rates of violence many people experience. The report did not make a clear set of recommendations but urged the federal government to do more to support people with disability during the coronavirus pandemic. Labor is calling on the Morrison government to act immediately on the issues presented by the interim report to prevent the further exclusion of people with disability from national planning and response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time Commissioner Ronald Sackville handed down the interim report, the royal commission made a request to the government that, due to the scale of work required and the COVID-19 pandemic, the April 2022 reporting date for the final report be extended by an extra 17 months, until 29 September 2023. Mr Sackville has reasoned that the broad scope of the inquiry's terms of reference—one of the biggest of any royal commission—means no firm recommendations could be made in the interim report and the commission needs an extension to hand down a final report. He is expected to request an extension to 29 September 2023. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the royal commission's request for an extension and urges the government to address the barriers preventing many people from making a submission before the closing date. It's almost two years into the inquiry and it is long overdue that these concerns be addressed. Labor will continue to call on the government to act so that the royal commission can maintain its integrity, and people with disability, their families and carers and the disability sector can have confidence that their evidence is heard independently and impartially.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor will be supporting these amendments. We don't see any distinction between the arrangements that were made by the previous Gillard Labor government in relation to the child sexual abuse royal commission and this royal commission into the abuse of people with disability. Arrangements were changed for the child sexual abuse royal commission to ensure that evidence could be provided confidentially, with privacy protections, outside of private sessions. We think that the same thing should be done in relation to the disability royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People with a disability have been waiting far too long for these terrible abuses and neglect to be properly investigated. We should all be doing everything we can to ensure that their evidence can be provided safely, confidentially and securely, to inspire confidence in this royal commission and to ensure that at last people with disability who have suffered abuse and neglect actually can be heard properly and securely and can have confidence that their concerns will be dealt with. These abuses have gone on too long. Confidentiality is required to make sure that they are properly addressed.</span>

                    <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I rise this morning to speak on the Royal Commissions Amendment (Confidentiality Protections) Bill 2020. While I and the government won't be supporting this legislation, we very much take very seriously violence against and the abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with a disability. That is why the Morrison government established the disability royal commission in the first place. All forms of violence against and abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with a disability are abhorrent. We as a society cannot allow it to happen and we must take action to eliminate it from our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill from Senator Steele-John comes after issues were raised by the chair of the royal commission, the Hon. Ronald Sackville, regarding the confidentiality of information given to that royal commission. The requested amendments to the act are so that people with a disability have assurance that their information is protected both during the life of the commission and after it has concluded its work. I thank Senator Steele-John for bringing this legislation forward. His passion and interest for the disability sector are undeniable. There is no denying that Senator Steele-John had the best interests of those providing evidence to the royal commission at heart when he introduced this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I respect the senator's intentions in bringing forward this legislation, the legislation proposed is, unfortunately, inadequate to deal with all the subsequent issues raised by Commissioner Sackville. However, while we are not supporting this legislation, the Morrison government are committed to amending the Royal Commissions Act. These amendments will address specific matters raised by the chair about the confidentiality of information given to the royal commission and other broader matters not captured in this bill proposed by the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has listened to people with a disability and their families and carers, as well as the broader Australian public, about the importance of ensuring people have the confidence to come forward and tell their stories. As a result of these consultations and the request from the chair of the royal commission, the Morrison government will introduce its own legislation. Our bill will ensure that people with a disability will be able to engage with the royal commission in the certainty that their information will be protected. People with a disability are equal citizens and have the right to the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including respect for their inherent dignity and individual autonomy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We established the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability in April 2019, following community concerns about widespread reports of unacceptable and abhorrent transgressions against people with disabilities. Such transgressions are not acceptable in a modern Australia; they never were and never are going to be acceptable. Since the royal commission was established, it has received more than 1,900 submissions and more than 7½ thousand telephone inquiries and has held 10 public hearings. An 11th public hearing commences in Brisbane tomorrow. It is clear from the evidence the royal commission has received that the Morrison government was right to call that commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The outcomes of the commission will be guided by people's lived experiences and its outcomes must be based on a true reflection of those experiences. In order for the royal commission to fully realise the scope of its inquiry, it is important that the Australian community feels comfortable and supported in fully engaging with the royal commission. It is critical that people sharing their experiences with the royal commission feel respected and that survivors of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation have their experiences appropriately acknowledged, recognised and validated, and the Morrison government is committed to ensuring that the disability royal commission does just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to being elected to this place, I had significant experience with royal commissions. I have advised governments and businesses through four royal commissions, so I know from firsthand experience that royal commissions already have strong protections in place and can ensure that people can engage with confidence about the protection of information and identity. These mechanisms include the use of private sessions or the use of pseudonyms in public hearings and reports of the royal commission, or through the making of do-not-publish orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has listened to the royal commission, advocates and disability supporters. We understand that the existing protections may not give people the necessary confidence to come forward and tell their stories. While there are extensive protections after a royal commission has ended, we understand there may be some concerns about the willingness of some people to come forward in this royal commission. For many people with disability and their families and carers, telling their story to the royal commission may be the first time in their life that they have disclosed their experiences of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation. For others, it is the first time their story has been heard by someone in a position of authority. We want those people to come forward. We want people to feel confident that, if and when they come forward, they will be protected. It is for this reason that the Morrison government is making changes to the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to further these protections. These further measures will ensure that people with disability and their supporters, advocates and families will be able to recount their experiences and fully participate in the royal commission. The amendment of the Royal Commissions Act by the Morrison government is proposed for the autumn sitting of this parliament this year. These amendments will go a long way to ensuring participants in the royal commission feel the information given to the inquiry is confidential and protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I or the Morrison government want to do is leave the disability community concerned that, because we're not supporting this legislation today, this means we're not listening to your concerns. We are 100 per cent committed to ensuring that you are listened to and that you feel supported.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  The Royal Commissions Amendment (Confidentiality Protections) Bill 2020 is extremely important. It addresses issues that absolutely need to be addressed in terms of being able to guarantee that people have privacy and their evidence is confidential.<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span>Senator Van has just said that he's had a lot of experience with royal commissions and that in fact people will be protected. Well, they won't be. Senator Steele-John has carefully articulated why they won't be so protected by the legislation under which people are covered at the moment if they are considering making a contribution to the royal commission. What we're trying to achieve with this bill is to ensure that people are guaranteed confidentiality and privacy in perpetuity so that they have the confidence to bring their accounts of what happened to them to the royal commission, because at the moment they do not have that confidence. This bill is absolutely essential to give disabled people the confidence to bring their accounts of their treatment to the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I chaired the Senate inquiry into violence, abuse and neglect against people with disability in institutional settings, and the accounts that we heard during that inquiry absolutely broke my heart. There were accounts of the sort of treatment that people received not only in residential facilities but in their homes, in schools and on school buses. In fact, for every setting where a disabled person was receiving care, we heard accounts of the mistreatment and abuse—sexual, physical and verbal as well—that disabled people received. People need to feel confident that they will be protected, and they are telling us, in particular telling Senator Steele-John, that that's not how they feel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side should actually listen to disabled people to hear what they are saying about their lack of confidence, to hear them say they are, I think it's fair to say, afraid to give evidence. These people have already been subjected to violence, neglect and abuse—and retribution. We also heard during the Senate inquiry about the retribution and the threatening behaviour that occurs if they dare to speak out, particularly if they are still in the institutions, still being provided some level of care. If Senator Steele-John thought this wasn't important, he wouldn't have brought this bill to the chamber. He would not be asking us to debate this bill if he had not heard firsthand accounts from disabled people saying this sort of protection is necessary. Why would we waste the Senate's time in debating something like this? It is of such grave importance that we have brought it to this place as a private senator's bill. To address violence against and abuse and neglect of disabled persons in this country, this bill is considered necessary by the very people for whom the royal commission is being held. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As people will see from the motion circulated in the chamber, the report handed down last Friday, the Bergin report, contained extremely disturbing inferences about Crown, pertaining to criminal conduct and money-laundering. It has escaped nobody's notice that Crown has donated almost $2 million to both sides of politics in the last 20 years and, indeed, in recent years amounts received by both sides of politics have been in quite large form. I understand that, as a result of that, the federal Labor Party are considering not accepting donations from Crown in the future. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We today are moving a motion, and our counterpart in the House will be moving a similar motion, asking both of the big parties to give that money back. Rather than giving it to Crown, why don't you give it to some gambling support services to help people who are addicted? This is a very clear call, hence the suspension of standing orders. This is an urgent matter. Our democracy has been for sale for a very long time, and this is just the latest example—and it is a most egregious example, because criminal conduct is being alleged, money-laundering is being alleged, and yet both the big parties are still happy to take money from Crown. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the fact that that decision's under review by the opposition, but it's not good enough to just say, 'We won't take any more.' We would like both of the big parties to reflect on the money that they have received in the last 20 years and to give that money back. Better to give it to support services for people who are addicted to gambling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the opportunity to share the views of Geoffrey Watson SC, who is a director of the Centre for Public Integrity. He makes a very salient point:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The fact they are donating most heavily in jurisdictions where they have casinos tells you it is related to some sort of benefit the company receives in respect to its operations …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Crown has been a donor in massive sums for years. It obviously opens doors and gets you access which you otherwise would not get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that's the point here. Crown are not donating out of the goodness of their heart. None of the big donors are donating out of the goodness of their heart. These big corporates, these big vested interests, these big industries are seeking policy advantage. And, when it comes to the gambling industry, they have received it, because we still don't have decent regulation of gambling or policies at the federal as well as the state levels. I know my colleague from Western Australia is very interested to see how the procedures failed in Western Australia, given that it too was implicated in the Bergin report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a desperate plea for us to clean up democracy. Return that money that you have received from Crown. We think that donations, no matter where they're coming from, should be capped, but this example is even more egregious than your standard pay for access, pay for policy outcomes; it's now been elevated to the level of criminality, to the level of money-laundering, and it is just untenable for big political parties to continue to receive donations from a company that is now so mired in controversy that it can no longer be a political donor. Give back the money or, better, give it to support services for people who need help with an addiction to gambling. Unfortunately, we know that that scourge grips so many Australians. In fact, in many ways it's caused by the very practices of those industries, particularly, algorithm designs—designs to encourage and deepen that addiction. We'd love to see action on that, and it's no wonder that we haven't. It's no wonder that we don't have a limit on pokies. It's no wonder that the dollar limits on pokies went absolutely nowhere, because the Hotels Association and Crown, in particular, have been paying for a very long time, and they have happily received the benefit of an absence of policy to regulate their activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The big parties have got a chance here to start to restore some confidence in democracy. Earlier today, we had a discussion about lowering the disclosure threshold. It's not good enough; we need more. We desperately need to cap donations. We need you to return that money from Crown and give it to support services for people with a gambling addiction. The Australian population deserve to have confidence that their democracy works for them. They are sick to death of democracy being for sale. It's not just the gambling industry, sadly. The list of people who buy influence is very, very long. We only get those statistics once a year. Well, we have the statistics now—$2 million. Give it to gambling support services to help people who are struggling with gambling addiction. Do the right thing. That is exactly why we are moving this motion today. My colleague Adam Bandt will be moving it the House as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  This afternoon we are here to debate the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2020. In referring to this bill, whilst the government have put forward technical amendments, we should not in any way step away from the weight of the issues that victims of childhood sexual abuse within institutions have experienced and the profound nature and importance of this scheme and its effective operation in providing redress to those victims. The effective operation of this redress scheme has been left wanting to a considerable degree. And, sadly, the government's technical amendments to this scheme do not add a great deal of weight to addressing the problems in the functioning of the scheme and its ability to support victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In rising to give this speech, I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate:</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) urges the Government to respond to calls from survivors to improve the National Redress Scheme and deliver quicker, fairer and better outcomes for recipients, as recommended by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Survivors of institutional child sexual abuse in our nation have already waited too long for redress. It's been two years since the national apology to survivors. We also know that the royal commission was launched nearly a decade ago, and that royal commission did substantial work towards the arrangements for the redress scheme. In looking at my participation in this legislation, both before I left the Senate in 2014 and when I resumed service in 2016, you can see that this issue has long been before the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the royal commission was launched almost a decade ago, in 2012, Prime Minister Gillard said to victims of this abuse, 'We hear you; we believe you.' But the government and, indeed, this parliament also made a commitment that our words would be backed with action and a willingness to commit ourselves to action to deliver redress to victims of this abuse. Survivors have waited too long and have already been through so much. We made a commitment to deliver redress that was timely, redress that does not retraumatise and redress that does not leave survivors missing out. We have seen, in the 31 months since the commencement of this scheme, that a mere fraction of the projected number of survivors have received redress; indeed, a mere fraction have actually applied for redress. We can see that too many are waiting, many are ill, many are aged, some are dying and some have missed out altogether because the institutions that they were subjected to abuse within are not yet part of the scheme. They have been unable to join the scheme for legal reasons, which we will debate later, or have simply been unwilling to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Western Australia, one such example is Fairbridge. Child migrants were sent to Australia from the UK and Malta when they were small children, children who were told they were orphans—many of them were not orphans—children who were used and abused at this institution and who have no redress, as yet, within this scheme. These people, who were children at the time they suffered this abuse, were children hurt by the British programs of child migration. These were programs that stretched across a number of countries and in which children were sent away to unsafe and, indeed, unprotected and uncaring places around the globe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other examples of victims who are unable to access redress because of the refusal of the Jehovah's Witnesses church to join the National Redress Scheme. I call on those within the Jehovah's Witnesses church to acknowledge that it would be right and just for them to join this scheme. I know the church has a strong doctrine where it seeks to put itself outside the law and simply operate according to the principles of its own faith, but I ask them: as a Christian institution, please step up and do the right thing. There are hundreds and thousands of followers of the Jehovah's Witnesses Church. We see their Kingdom Hall and their assets right around the country. I would call on you to make sure that justice is done for the victims of sexual abuse within your institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for us to get redress delivering on its promise for survivors. This is why Labor will be moving a series of amendments to address the longstanding structural and emerging issues within the National Redress Scheme. It's been a privilege for me to serve as a committee member of the Joint Select Committee on Implementation of the National Redress Scheme—I've only been serving in that role for a short time—because it takes brave victims to continue to tell their stories not only about the abuse that they suffered but also about how their experiences now intersect with the institutional and justice arrangements of the Redress Scheme. It is not easy for them, as the examples of victims within the Jehovah's Witness church, those from Fairbridge and others have shown. It is a scheme that has been rolled out by the government but, unfortunately, has not fully realised the recommendations of the royal commission. Frankly, it has failed to deliver on the redress that it promised victims. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's amendments today seek to better reflect the experience of survivors and the spirit of the original recommendations that came out of the royal commission. I have to note that some of these issues were raised by Labor at the outset, in our original critique of the bill when it was first passed. Many of these issues were, indeed, foreseen and remained unaddressed at that time. But, of course, Labor did not want to get in the way. We supported the passing of the bill because we wanted to see the system get up and running so that it could serve victims' needs. Now we again have an opportunity to raise these issues. We hope that the government will support these amendments and respond accordingly and we call on it to do so. Our amendments today are essentially the same amendments that we moved to this legislation in the House. They are modest amendments that give the government the flexibility to negotiate with the states and territories and the latitude to fix the issues within the scheme in the most effective and efficient way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments also give the government the ability to take into account relevant findings from the review of the scheme. Mostly, it's simply a case of the government getting up and showing leadership and the conviction to back the needs of victims who deserve a functioning and accountable redress scheme. We call on the government to clearly say to survivors, to the public and, indeed, to this parliament what you will do to fix the substantial issues with the scheme or, at least, to explain why you won't fix it. This shouldn't be put into the too-hard basket. As I'll outline now, the changes that we have put forward don't jeopardise any aspect of the scheme. The opposition wants to say to the government, 'We want to work with you constructively to get the scheme actually delivering for survivors.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that the opposition acknowledge our position on the purpose of the bill, as the government has outlined in its technical amendments. We acknowledge that the bill puts forward administrative amendments. I won't go through those, because I have insufficient time. The royal commission said that an estimated 60,000 survivors would be eligible for redress. But as at January 2021 there were 9,232 applications, just under 5½ thousand decisions, 4,660 applications and 4,620 payments. These statistics represent just a fraction of those victims that should have access to the scheme. Many of the reasons that there aren't more applications come down to the onerous nature of making an application. It would take over 30 years for the estimated 60,000 victims to get redress if the current pace of making findings and giving out money were to be maintained. These delays are a form of further trauma. I look forward to being able to discuss our amendments further. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2020. This bill makes a series of important technical amendments to the operation of the National Redress Scheme. The Greens are broadly supportive of this bill; however, we do have some concerns about the operation of these amendments, which we will monitor and on which I will make some comments now. First off, we have concerns around associate institutions. This bill changes the way associate institutions in a group are determined, listed and described for notices and offers of redress. Under these changes, survivors will no longer be provided with a full list of associates of participating institutions when they accept or reject an offer of redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee into this bill, stakeholders raised concerns that these changes could have unintended consequences for survivors. The national community legal service knowmore highlighted that it is important that survivors understand which institutions they will be releasing from civil liability if they accept an offer of redress. Stakeholders suggested alternative ways the full list of associate institutions could be provided to survivors—for example, the scheme operator could allow survivors to request this information in writing, associates of participating institutions could be identified on the Redress Scheme's website, or a full list could be provided to survivors earlier in the application process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be monitoring the implementation of these changes closely to ensure that survivors continue to be provided with information about associates of participating institutions and are able to make informed decisions about redress offers. I would note here that, if this isn't working, there will inevitably be more amendments to this bill once the independent assessor's report is provided to the government and the necessary amendments, which we all know will need to be made, are debated. We put the government on notice that, if this particular amendment is not working, we'll be seeking amendments to it again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current Redress Scheme, government institutions can become funders of last resort—for example, where non-government institutions no longer exist. The current Redress Scheme assumes that only one government institution will be involved as a funder of last resort. This bill makes changes to clarify that one or more participating government institutions can become funders of last resort. Some stakeholders expressed concerns that this change could lead to further delays for survivors seeking redress. The Australian Greens strongly echo these concerns and urge the scheme operator to ensure these changes do not result in further delays for survivors. I will have more to say on this issue shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Engaging independent decision-makers is another area that this bill amends. At the moment, the appointment of each independent decision-maker must be approved by the Minister for Families and Social Services in consultation with state and territory ministers. This bill, instead, will allow the scheme operator to appoint decision-makers in consultation with states and territories. It is expected this change may reduce delays experienced by survivors on the decision of their application. Legal firm Ryan Carlisle Thomas noted that devolving responsibility to the scheme operator would not provide sufficient scrutiny for the appointment of decision-makers. Again, we will be monitoring the implications of the implementation of this new appointment process very closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commencement of the National Redress Scheme in 2018 represented a milestone for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. However, this legislation was flawed from the beginning—make no mistake. The Greens sought to amend it at the time. If people recall, we were coming up to the deadline for when the legislation would come into effect. Unfortunately, if we'd delayed the legislation any longer then that would have delayed redress for survivors. So it was a catch-22 situation, where we knew the legislation was flawed but we didn't want to disappoint survivors. We are now dealing with the consequences. The proposed amendments, which were debated in this very chamber, would have avoided some of the issues we are dealing with right now. We'll certainly need changes in response to the independent assessor's two-yearly review of the scheme, and some of those changes will need to address the issues that were raised in 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the Redress Scheme is not as good as it could be. There are many issues that need to be fixed urgently. As a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Implementation of the National Redress Scheme, I've been made aware, yet again, of many of these issues. The committee's first interim report found that the National Redress Scheme application process can retraumatise survivors. Preparing an application is often a stressful and traumatic experience for survivors. It can take months for survivors to finalise their application because they are retraumatised—their trauma is triggered—by actually filling out the form. The lack of published guidelines for decision-making limits the ability of survivors and their advocates to understand what should be included in their application. Survivors continue to experience long waiting times—although I do acknowledge that the department is working to get this under control, and it has improved for certain applications. It's just not good enough that survivors can have their civil claims resolved in a shorter time than it takes to get a redress application completed. We need to make urgent reforms to the application process to ensure that it does not further harm and traumatise survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I continue to hold serious concerns about the government's $150,000 cap on redress payments. As we in this place all know, the royal commission actually recommended a $200,000 cap on redress payments, which the government rejected. The lower cap may be a reason for survivors to pursue civil actions instead of going through the Redress Scheme. Lawyers have suggested that civil actions result in awards of hundreds of thousands of dollars, compared with the average redress payment of around $80,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The practice of indexing payments is unfair and needs to be reformed. Over 449 payments have been adjusted due to prior payments, with the average value of the adjustment being $34,574. Some survivors have also had their redress payments reduced to zero because of indexation. The indexation of payments needs to be removed immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also significant gaps in survivors getting access to counselling and psychological care services and supports. These include gaps around access in rural areas, access to culturally safe and sensitive healing programs and access to specialist financial counselling. The government has put time limits and monetary caps on access to counselling and psychological services, which goes against the royal commission's recommendations. All survivors and their families should be able to engage with high-quality, specialised counselling and psychological care services in order to address their trauma and to limit the retraumatisation, as I've just articulated, that is occurring through the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funder-of-last-resort provisions continue to let survivors down, as they are too restrictive. This was articulated in this place during the debate on the primary legislation. These issues were addressed during that discussion. We sought to amend the legislation but, unfortunately, those amendments weren't supported. These provisions need to be amended. I'm sure that when we see the report of independent assessor's review we will need to come back and readdress the funder-of-last-resort issue. Under the current scheme, the government can become a funder of last resort for institutions that no longer exist, known as defunct institutions. But these provisions apply only when the government has supposedly equal responsibility for the abuse that occurred in the now defunct institution. The government should be a funder of last resort regardless of whether or not it was involved in the institution or had responsibility for the child when they were abused. Survivors shouldn't miss out on payments because of these narrow provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of October 2020 there were 88 applications for redress that named funder-of-last-resort institutions, but only 29 of these applications had been determined. Of these, only 20 payments had been made. It's clear that the funder-of-last-resort provisions are preventing significant numbers of survivors from accessing redress. The government needs to consider how we can expand the funder-of-last-resort provisions to ensure that all survivors have equal access to redress and don't experience unfair waiting times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is distressing that some institutions, including those named in the royal commission, have not yet joined the National Redress Scheme, even though they have been named. While these institutions have been publicly named and shamed, they continue to drag their feet. We need to consider the impact this is having on survivors who feel distress and feel like they have nowhere to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that the minister is taking these issues seriously and that we are making progress on compelling institutions to join the scheme. But, as was just articulated, the Jehovah's Witnesses still have not joined. It is outrageous that they do not accept responsibility for the children who were abused in their care. We need to think about ways that we can work together to take all possible actions to ensure the institutions are held to account. It is imperative that the government takes every possible action against these institutions which fail to uphold their moral, social and ethical responsibilities by declining or unnecessarily delaying their participation in the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second-anniversary review of the National Redress Scheme is, hopefully, just about complete. I am confident that this independent review will make clear recommendations on how we can improve the Redress Scheme. I'm confident of that because I'm sure that the survivors—in particular, those who have been giving their comments and evidence to the review—will be voicing their very strong concerns about the failings of the Redress Scheme. If they are listened to, there will need to be recommendations made about amendments. It's especially important that the review looks into publishing the assessment framework policy guidelines, streamlining applicant and decision-making processes and creating a direct complaint avenue for survivors. The Australian Greens will continue to closely monitor the outcomes of this review and push for change so that the Redress Scheme supports all survivors and holds all institutions to account.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  I also rise this afternoon to make some comments in regard to the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2020. Of course, this bill deals with some technical amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think every senator is beholden—and Senator Siewert did mention this briefly—to acknowledge the work and the progress that is already happening in the National Redress Scheme. I think it's important to say this at the very, very, very beginning. I've heard comments made about the royal commission's report and recommendations, and I'll reflect on two observations about the royal commission's outcomes that have not actually been reflected in the experience of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate that at 31 December 2020, just three months ago, 450 institutions, covering over 60,600 sites had in fact signed up. The scheme had received 9,117 applications. There had been 4,350 payments made to survivors, totalling $377 million, and a further 540 offers were awaiting a decision by the applicants themselves. So let's just put that in context: in the first year of the scheme, 47 institutions had joined; in the second year of the scheme, this number had grown by 176; and, in the third year of the scheme, it had grown by another 223 institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm someone who believes publicly and privately that the National Redress Scheme is working, is growing and is making the necessary progress that many of us had hoped it would make. Is there an opportunity for continued improvement? Yes, there most definitely is. I'm someone who believes that the scheme will always be and should always be in a state of constant recalibration. If it is to be responsive to the needs, the interests and the concerns of survivors—as shared with government and parliamentarians via survivors themselves and survivor groups—then it must be, and we must recognise that it will be, in a constant state of recalibration and improvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two observations made by the royal commission that I do think need to be reflected upon. One is that the royal commission—and it's not an error or a fault of the royal commission; it couldn't see the future—overestimated the number of applications that the National Redress Scheme would get. It overestimated the number of applications the scheme would receive. What the royal commission didn't foresee was the complexity of those applications, and I see Senator Siewert, if I may, nodding in agreement with my observation. I think this is a very important point to be mentioned upfront, because, when we came to designing the scheme, it was designed with a variety of assumptions—and this is a reflection of the good work that the royal commission and senators in this place and other parliamentarians contributed to—but those early observations may not be the experience of the scheme thus far. On those two points, I think that's very true: the number of applications received has not been as great as the royal commission expected, but the complexity of those applications has been greater. That was not foreseen by the royal commission. This is a particularly important point when people come into the chamber and say, 'Well, the royal commission was expecting X but the scheme has only delivered Y, and therefore the scheme is unsuccessful.' Not true. The second point I would make is that, as the scheme develops and matures, different sorts of survivor groups and their needs come to the fore more sharply. I'll reflect on this a little bit later in my contribution. There are two particular groups that I think require much greater and urgent attention, and I'll come to those in a brief moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is moving a variety of amendments. These amendments, as Senator Pratt alluded to, were moved in the House of Representatives. Let me be very clear about this: these are amendments that ignore a critical feature of the scheme, and that is that the scheme is actually not a Commonwealth scheme. It is in fact a scheme in which the Commonwealth is working in cooperation with the states and territories. So whatever our views in this parliament might be about what changes and improvements should be made to the scheme, they have to be agreed to by the relevant ministers in states and territories. I think that is a good design feature, but it does present some challenges where particular jurisdictions might have a view that other jurisdictions don't hold onto.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I would make in regard to Labor's amendments, if I've understood them correctly, is that they actually don't make any real changes and many of these matters are already under active review by the independent reviewer Robyn Kruk and, as Senator Siewert alluded to, the committee which I chair, the Joint Select Committee on Implementation of the National Redress Scheme. We are hoping to see that report ourselves very soon, to make our own judgements about how effective the independent review process has been on collecting and identifying further improvements to and recalibrations of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of the credit, I believe, for getting so many institutions to join the scheme must go to the very clear commitment of the Morrison government and its forthrightness in following through on its justified threat to name and shame institutions and to strip them of their tax and charitable benefits. But now is the time to refocus our efforts on two specific survivor groups whose access to justice, in my view, has been blocked. Both of these groups, of course, have a strong Western Australian character.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view—and I think I probably speak for many on the parliamentary committee—redress must now be urgently delivered to those Fairbridge kids who were among the 3,580 British child migrants sent to the Kingsley Fairbridge Farm School near Pinjarra between 1913 and 1982. The original Fairbridge ceased operating in the early 1980s, when it was rolled into the Prince's Trust. That organisation has established Fairbridge Restored Ltd to act as the legal entity responsible for meeting the liabilities of Fairbridge farm schools. While Fairbridge Restored was publicly named last year for its failure to join the scheme, we now understand that its reluctance was due to legal barriers in the United Kingdom rather than a lack of willingness or good faith on its part. That is evidence that has been made available to the parliamentary committee, and again I see Senator Siewert nodding. But it's clear to me and to others in the Senate chamber that the unique and unforeseen circumstances surrounding Fairbridge kids warrant special attention. It is reassuring to know that this is a view that is also shared by the National Redress Scheme, with the secretary of the Department of Social Services having described the matter at a public hearing as having a 'sense of urgency' and noting that they are very committed to resolving this issue 'as quickly as we can', as the secretary said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second priority in 2021 must be to improve the level of awareness of and access to the scheme for Indigenous survivors. We know that there are factors, including poor understanding of the scheme in regional and remote areas, access to records and historical documentation, and even a reluctance to ask questions out of fear of being judged, that are preventing greater Indigenous participation and therefore access to justice. There can also be cultural unwillingness to detail accounts of historic childhood sexual abuse which is stopping many older Indigenous survivors from even starting an application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year, the committee heard from the CEO of the Kimberley Stolen Generation Aboriginal Corporation, who detailed for the committee key areas where the scheme could be improved to better address the needs of Indigenous Australians, including increased access to culturally appropriate support in remote communities. In evidence to a parliamentary committee, the Kimberley Stolen Generation Aboriginal Corporation noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Aboriginal people don't see counselling the same way non-Indigenous people do … That's not what works for them and it's not culturally appropriate for them either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 3,123 applications for redress received between July 2019 and June 2020, 1,052 were from Indigenous survivors, representing 34 per cent of all applications for that period. When I was in the Kimberley region just a few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to meet with the Kimberley Stolen Generation Aboriginal Corporation. They reiterated to me their very, very strong view that more could be done to provide better access, and therefore justice, for Indigenous Australians but that there was a plan and that they had some excellent ideas about how that could be done. People should not be denied access to the scheme because they live in remote areas of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was reviewing the contributions of members of the House of Representatives over the weekend in preparation for some remarks today, I realised you could come to the wrong conclusion. That wrong conclusion is that nothing is happening in regard to national redress. Nothing could be further from the truth; a lot is happening. The timeliness has improved; indeed, the investment by the Australian government of an additional $104 million over the next four years is timely and is necessary. But we should not allow ourselves to fall asleep at this particular wheel. More must be done. More can be done. I would hasten to add that my considered sense is that across the parliament, in the Department of Social Services—who are responsible for the National Redress Scheme—and in the community there is a great willingness and a great sense of urgency to make sure that justice can be delivered in the most timely and effective way for survivors and for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave those brief remarks there. Finally, I extend the appreciation of not just the joint parliamentary committee but also all those people who have come into contact with the National Redress Scheme and have had a good experience to officers in the Department of Social Services and the National Redress Scheme for the important work they do on this very, very important matter.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Thank you, Senator Dean Smith, for your ongoing strong advocacy on behalf of survivors. In my first speech in this parliament and several times since then I have indicated that my father was sent to Australia. He was in a home for children in Birmingham in the United Kingdom. He ended up at Fairbridge, as Senator Smith knows. He came out at the age of 12. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He wasn't one of the children who didn't know who his family was. Indeed, he came from a very large family. His mother had taken up with a new man who didn't want the existing children that were in the family, so my father and his brother, my uncle Arthur, were put in the Birmingham children's home, despite the fact that they grew up in Coventry. My father has passed away now but, thankfully, because of the British government's actions in saying sorry, he was able to go back to the UK and meet with his family. They, of course, always knew that he was missing. He met for the first time a sister who hadn't been born when he left, but she knew all about her brother Bill and her brother Arthur, who had been sent to Fairbridge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that my father's life at Fairbridge was very harsh. There's no doubt about that. Uncle Arthur's life at Fairbridge was harsh as well. My father was spared the reported abuse that did occur at Fairbridge, but he knew other children from Fairbridge who gave evidence to the royal commission of the abuse that they had suffered. So I've got a personal stake in this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is rather ironic today that we've just had the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition give their comments around Sorry Day. We heard from Minister Ken Wyatt and our shadow minister Ms Linda Burney. The flavour of all of those speeches was that we are sorry for what happened to the stolen generations in this country—horrific times. Yet comments were also made that it had taken too long. Often on matters we are poles apart, but on this matter we are not. I think for the survivors of sexual abuse, despite the best intentions, it is still taking too long. Sadly, as the time goes by, survivors start to pass away. That's the case for my father and Uncle Arthur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Arthur, sadly, never got the chance to go back and meet his UK family, who clearly loved both Uncle Arthur and my family. To see the resemblance, to see where my dad grew up, to see the schools he went to and to see the pub that my grandparents drank at—all those sorts of things that are part of everyday life—were denied to him. That was really important. I'm still sad that Uncle Arthur never got that chance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission estimated that some 60,000 survivors would be eligible for redress. Certainly we don't want to see survivors waiting any longer than necessary. Other contributors have gone through that we have received less than that, but of course there's great shame about being sexually abused. Not every person who has been abused is going to come forward. That's the shame of it. We need to be making a scheme that makes it easier for people, not harder. We need to create a framework that's robust and transparent and where moneys are accountable, but one that is not onerous for people to come forward, put their hand up and claim the redress that they are so justly and fairly entitled to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme has received nearly 10,000 applications. It has made about 5½ thousand decisions. It's finalised 4,600-odd applications, and the moneys to date are just under $4 million. But we know there are 512 applications on hold, waiting on institutions to join the scheme. This is unacceptable, and we've heard from contributors to this debate this morning that it is unacceptable. There's no doubt that the laws and our society and our culture at the time enabled this sexual abuse to happen, and we do need to not allow institutions to remain outside of the scheme. If they're a named institution and sexual abuse has occurred, they must be part of the redress. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly one of the amendments that Labor will seek to move later today is a requirement that the minister does name and shame these institutions who refuse to join the scheme. I know that the minister's been very strong on naming and shaming, but we do want it to be a requirement, because, as time goes on, ministers change and so on and so forth. It is shameful that we've had to get to the point where we've had to threaten institutions who clearly have not done the right thing that they'll be named and shamed and that their tax allowances and so on will be under question. It is shameful that we've had to really go in hard like that, but, nevertheless, let's put the victims before the institutions and be very clear that we want to see that it is a requirement, because, really, we don't want survivors, who've suffered enough, to be waiting any longer than absolutely necessary before they get what they are so justly entitled to. There's no doubt that there's the action of the abuse itself and then, of course, there's that ongoing impact, where you still see people in their 60s and 70s breaking down and feeling ashamed about what happened to them when they were young children. That's an amendment that Labor's keen to pursue. These aren't new amendments that have suddenly arisen today; they have been the view of Labor for a very long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want to see the cap increase. Our view has been, right from when we heard the evidence, that the cap ought to be increased from the current amount of $150,000 up to $200,000, because what we believe is happening is that survivors are being pushed into civil processes, and that undermines the scheme in and of itself—if the scheme is seen by some to be inadequate because the cap is too low. You want to have the redress to civil processes there but being the exception, in rare circumstances. We don't want it to be used increasingly because people are not satisfied that receiving the full cap amount, currently of $150,000, is inadequate. We think it ought to be up to $200,000, and this is an opportunity, with Labor's amendment, for the government to actually do the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have an amendment that looks at the indexation of prior payments. It is heartbreaking to hear the stories of people who get barely any redress once a tiny payment from years ago is indexed. It's fair to say state governments, and institutions themselves, have had a number of goes at this trying to get it right. Now we're at the point where we've got amendments that we say will make it right, and we really do want to see them taken up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of funders of last resort has certainly been around for a while. There are some institutions—Fairbridge doesn't neatly fit the issue. Senator Smith went into its various iterations, but we do need governments in whatever form, whether it's the Commonwealth or the states, to be funders of last resort. We can't have survivors left high and dry because their institution no longer operates, through no fault of their own, when clearly redress is needed. We do believe that that should be something that happens as a matter of course. Our amendment, if it gets up, will seek to ensure that governments act as funders of last resort when people would have otherwise missed out. I don't think it's the intention of the government or anyone in this place that people miss out. That's not the intention behind this amendment. It's just us saying we really do need it to be shored up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want—again, this is not new—the government to consider the establishment of an advanced payment scheme. As I said earlier—and, no doubt, other senators have said—we have people ageing out. We see that all the time. With claims that go back a generation or 20 or 30 years, lawyers can play fancy games in civil proceedings to time matters out, and a person then dies. We are saying that, with an advance payment, you would get the bulk of the moneys upfront, so they are of use to the person, who finally gets some money and a public acknowledgment of the hurt and suffering that they endured. They would get the bulk of those moneys upfront, which they can use in whatever way they see fit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a similar scheme currently being used in Scotland, and that's been well received by survivors over there. Given the decades and years that many survivors have waited for a chance at redress and justice, it's vital that people don't die waiting. Again, as I said, that's certainly not the government's intention. I don't want anyone to be under the misapprehension that that's what Labor's saying. We just think it's an additional measure—that we can give a person an advance payment. So that's what we're seeking with that amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our amendments, as I said, are nothing new. They have been around a good while, and we really do want the government to consider them in a serious manner and to be able to agree to them. And there is that issue of the indexation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The redress assessment matrix has also been widely criticised. Again, we start with an idea. If it doesn't work properly, then let's look at it and review it and get something that does. We know that many survivors need counselling and psychological care from time to time throughout their lives. Certainly we heard this in evidence. The evidence that I heard at one of the Senate inquiries—and Senator Smith mentioned First Nations people, too—is to make that counselling available through a survivor's life. As a victim, as you go through the various stages of grief, of anger and of coming to terms with issues, new issues will come up. All of us who have experienced trauma know that there will be a moment, when you're really doing nothing, and suddenly it all comes and hits you. That could be five years after the whole affair, or it could be 20 years or 30 years. There's no doubt, if we accept there's long-term impact and damage, then we've got to accept that counselling ought be available throughout a victim's life. I think it's one of the least things that we can do. We need to establish a benchmark—a safety net, if you like—that really does capture, protect and enhance the rights of survivors in whatever way we can. I want to be part of a parliament that does that—that we honour and we continue to honour survivors of sexual abuse by institutions. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I thank all senators who have made a contribution to the debate on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2020 and acknowledge the multipartisan way in which everybody in this chamber has approached this very, very serious issue and the response that we, as a parliament, want to provide. This bill seeks to amend the primary legislation for the scheme. The bill proposes to increase the efficiency of the scheme for its remaining eight years of operation and to make sure that we assist in finalising outstanding applications. The amendments address minor and technical issues with the current operation of the act and will address unintended consequences or oversights in the initial drafting of the primary legislation underpinning this scheme. Consistent with the survivor focus of the scheme, survivor groups support the passage of this bill, as does the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. In accordance with the scheme's governance arrangements, all jurisdictions have supported the progression of the bill, and they are required to be consulted on and approve all future changes to the redress act, due to the cooperative basis under which this scheme continues to operate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of the amendments that are being brought forward to this bill, I do acknowledge a very, very strong shared desire to continue to improve this scheme. The bill adds to the strong improvements that have already been put in place for the scheme, and the government remains committed to improving the scheme and encouraging all institutions that have been named to join the scheme. Pleasingly, the government has already been at work, and 191 institutions have joined the scheme in its third year of operation. The number has grown through the use of the naming and shaming of recalcitrant institutions. The government has already implemented measures to name and shame institutions that fail to sign up to the scheme and financial penalties for those that fail to join the scheme. These two levers come into force six months after the first meaningful contact with the institution, once it has been named. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has also commenced the legislated two-year review, which is currently being undertaken by Robyn Kruk AO. The report has a focus on all aspects raised in the shadow minister's amendments and incorporates extensive consultation with survivors. This report will be made public. Changes of this nature would need to be endorsed by the redress board, which comprises state and territory ministers, meaning the amendments would be unlikely to be implemented, regardless of their passage through this place. As such, the government do not support these amendments, and we remain committed to the continuous improvement of this scheme and making sure that survivors continue to inform the decisions around any changes to the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response specifically to the amendments that have been put forward, I would say that, in relation to the naming and shaming amendment, clearly we have done everything that we said we would do. We named and shamed the institutions on 1 July last year, and, pleasingly, on 1 January this year we didn't have to name or shame any other institutions. If in the future we find institutions that have a responsibility or a moral obligation under this scheme to join the scheme, we will name and shame those organisations if they do not do the right thing by survivors. As I said, we have taken real and tangible action against those organisations by making sure that, through consultation, we have in process—and, hopefully, it will be gazetted very soon—the revoking of the charitable status of all organisations that refuse to join the scheme. As the federal government, we have also said that we will not allow any institution that has not joined the scheme but should join the scheme to ever be eligible for any government grants. I'm pleased to say that many of the states and territories are currently in the process of making sure that that is also the case for the grants that are issued through state and territory grant processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The two-year review is currently underway, and I want to make sure that we are seeking the advice of survivors so that any response that we make to the review is absolutely informed by survivors themselves. We do not want to pre-empt the review, despite the genuineness of the amendments that are before us today. In principle, the government has no issue with the sentiment of the amendments put forward by the opposition today. But we want to make sure that the two-year review that's currently being undertaken is allowed to take its course. It is due to report at the end of this month, only a few weeks from now. As I said, we will make this report publicly available for everybody to see. Through the appropriate process of the national redress board, I will then take this to the redress board, a cross-government initiative made up of the ministers of all the states and territories and the federal government, to make sure we are deliver the redress that Australian survivors of institutional child sex abuse so rightfully deserve. </span>

Rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most significant public health campaigns we have had to conduct this century, and this government is on track to deliver that program. In fact, Minister Hunt has announced this afternoon that the Pfizer vaccinations have just touched down in Sydney, which is a significant milestone for this country. The Australian government aims to have as many people vaccinated as soon as possible. Identified priority groups will be the first to get the available doses of vaccines, and more and more people will progressively have access to a vaccine as more doses become available.</span>

It will commence with identified priority populations including aged-care and disability residents, frontline healthcare workers, and quarantine and border workers. They will receive the vaccine first up as part of phase 1A. Phase 1B will include adults aged 70 years and over; other healthcare workers; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 55; younger adults with an underlying medical condition, including those with a disability; critical high-risk workers including defence, fire, police and emergency services; and meat-processing workers. All these groups have been identified as critical to receive the vaccine as soon as possible. Phase 2A includes adults aged 50 to 69 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 18 to 54 years and other critical high-risk workers.</span>

Australia is fortunate to be in a position of having secured enough doses to cover the Australian population three times over. So far the Australian government has agreements in place for our community in Australia, which includes 20 million Pfizer doses, 53.8 million AstraZeneca doses and 51 million Novavax doses. We also have access up to 25.6 million doses through the Covax Facility.</span>

We are protecting those who are most likely to experience serious disease. We are maintaining the functioning of healthcare and other essential services to preserve health, social and economic security and are extending the vaccination to the general population as quickly as possible. Each phase of the rollout strategy is structured to align with specific population groups based on their risks as advised by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. At every step, our highest priority is to safeguard our most precious of resources—our people. Our No. 1 aim is to prevent death and severe disease and limit the transmission of this insidious virus to the maximum extent possible.</span>

I don't have in front of me the specific figures that Senator Farrell has quoted, but I will take those at face value as Senator Farrell has articulated them. I would observe, as I understood his question, that they relate to the jobs profile in Australia in 2020, which is characterised by being completely uncharacteristic of any previous year in living memory—that is, a work, jobs and economic environment completely struck by a global pandemic in which Australians and, in fact, the international community found their lives disrupted, workplaces disrupted and whole economies disrupted. What this government did, and continues to do, was to seek, through a number of initiatives—including additional payments, additional JobSeeker payments, JobKeeper itself and, ultimately, the development of the JobMaker Plan—to ensure that as many workers as possible were supported in the workplace and that as many workers as possible who unavoidably lost their jobs due to the pandemic were also supported as best as possible. That was an extraordinary undertaking by this government in 2020, one of the most significant investments of funds in Australia in anyone's living memory or lifetime. So a number of jobs to which Senator Farrell has referred obviously returned in a different manifestation than they previously had. That's correct. But what the JobKeeper statistics now show is that the economy is improving and, indeed, that Australia has gone ahead of many other major advanced nations, with a larger proportion of Australians who were in work before this crisis still in work today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government's reforms will provide the strongest ever casual conversion rights to employees who want to become permanent and spread those rights to all those employees who don't have conversion rights now—for example, those in the coal industry. For whatever reason, those opposite don't want this. They apparently think that casuals workers should stick with the rights they were given by those opposite over a decade ago. They see casuals who want permanent work as 'collateral damage'. Our reforms will introduce stronger penalties for wage underpayment and wage theft to ensure employees' entitlements are secure, as well as a more efficient path to recover underpayments where they do occur. Again, those opposite don't want that. In fact, so committed are they to do nothing about wage theft that the opposition's industrial relations spokesman thought it'd be a good idea to do a press conference outside a 7-Eleven. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In the absence of that, I will continue to refer the senator to the facts that exist within the government's legislation. Our reforms will incentivise permanent work, complete with paid leave entitlements in our vital retail and hospitality sectors, as well as help give more hours of work for the more than 100,000 part-time employees in those sectors which are underemployed under the system that those opposite actually set up. Again, they don't seem to want to fix that; they don't seem to see the underemployed as important. Our reforms are focused on boosting pay by reinvigorating an enterprise bargaining system that, on average, pays 69 per cent, or $500 more a week than award wages, but that has seen the total number of agreements more than halve, from 25,000 down to 10,000, under the broken system that was put in place by those opposite. Even former Prime Minister Keating thinks the current system, as put in place by those opposite— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In particular, as we know, JobKeeper has been an essential policy. It's now estimated to have provided $90 billion worth of support, and it is a wage subsidy on a scale that has never been seen in Australia. The cash-flow boost, giving businesses back their own hard earned money, saw over $35 billion provided to over 800,000 businesses. The supporting apprentices wage subsidy has kept around 119,500 apprentices on the tools in 62,600 small businesses.

Our legislated tax cuts for small and medium businesses, the full expensing for new investments—something that was welcomed widely by businesses across Australia—and our loss carry-back measure are a suite of policies that will all provide that much-needed support and much-needed boost for small businesses, who, as we know, still continue to do it tough. We need to help them to ensure that their businesses are able to grow so that they can continue to create more jobs for Australians. Our $4 billion Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy is supporting small businesses out there to take on a new apprentice in their business. Small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy, and the Morrison government will back them every step of the way.</span>

In fact, as Senator Small would know, it's not just about being the business owner and running the business; you work enormously hard. You are often the HR department, you are often the bookkeeper, you are often the marketing department, you are often the floor staff, and you often need to get the family to work in the business on the weekend. But every day small-business people across Australia get up and go to work because they are passionate about their business. They're passionate about giving other Australians the opportunity of work. The one thing that I'm always humbled by when it comes to small business is that they don't ask for a lot from government. They don't ask for much, but what they do need and do want is to be supported to do what they do best—run their business and employ Australians.</span>

I refer to today's reports of an alleged rape of a young Liberal staffer that happened in this building. The PMO provided support to Minister Reynolds's office in relation to this incident. The government, in a recently issued statement, says that it 'regrets in any way if Ms Higgins felt unsupported through this process'. Ms Higgins has said she did feel unsupported. She was interviewed in the room she was raped in, she didn't access the Employee Assistance Program, she felt she was discouraged from reporting the rape to police and she was shunted from office to office. And no-one in the government or the minister's office has apologised to her yet. Now the minister seems to have a confused recollection of whether she even understood there was a rape allegation that had been disclosed. What action will you take to ensure that her experience is not repeated? When will the safety of women be put ahead of political interests? </span>

The safety of everybody in any workplace is of paramount importance, especially the safety of women in the workplace and their ability to feel safe and secure in their working environment. Today's reports are deeply distressing. Throughout the entire process, the government's concern was to support Ms Higgins's welfare in whatever way possible. We understand that this matter has now been put under consideration by the Australian Federal Police. It is an important step, and the government has consistently supported that option from the outset. We will await the outcome of that process. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am advised that, at all times, guidance was sought from Ms Higgins as to how she wished to proceed and to support and respect her decisions. The important best-practice principle—as in the Prime Minister's statement, which you referenced, or the statement that was tabled in the House of Representatives, which you referenced—of empowering Ms Higgins is something the government has sought to follow. I understand Ms Higgins was notified that, should she choose to pursue a complaint, including a complaint to the police, that was within her rights, and she would be assisted and supported through that process. </span>

Of course, where an assault is alleged to have occurred, I would encourage anyone to pursue that with the appropriate police and authorities but also to know, whether an assault or instances of bullying, harassment or otherwise, all employees can access confidential support and counselling through the Employee Assistance Program. That program is there for their support, and the Department of Finance will treat them with respect and confidentiality as they wish. </span>

I give the minister the opportunity to respond to the question she declined to answer earlier, as follows: can the minister assure the Senate that neither she, her staff, nor any of the Prime Minister's staff said or did anything which may have encouraged, implicitly or explicitly, her former staff member not to pursue the incident with police?</span>

The government's proposed industrial relations bill, in its current construct, is overly complex and seriously undermines the better off overall test, which protects workers from dodgy wage deals. Australian workers and small businesses have sacrificed so much during state and federal government virus lockdowns and restrictions, while big business have largely flourished. Pausing the BOOT test for two years would effectively leave the door open to big business cutting wages and conditions and, ultimately, leave many Australian workers worse off. Minister, is the Morrison government prepared to sink the boot into its changes in order to enable One Nation and other crossbench members to continue genuine discussions on industrial relations reform that won't hurt Australian workers and will protect Australian workers?</span>

Let me begin by responding to the last part of his question and absolutely assure him that of course the government is prepared to engage in constructive discussions and negotiation with him and his colleague Senator Hanson, and with all members of the chamber, on these matters. Of course we are, as we have done in the past on a whole range of pieces of legislation, and we continue to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would seem, Senator Roberts, that we do have a different view about the implications in relation to the better off overall test in the legislation. I've noted your view. I think, however, there are, outside this chamber, and perhaps inside in some cases, a number of false claims being made about the proposed changes to the better off overall test under the enterprise bargaining framework. For example, there have been suggestions that we are removing the better off overall test. That is not the case. The bill does not remove the test. In fact, enterprise agreements will continue to leave workers better off than they would be under the relevant award. That's one of the reasons that the bill is making enterprise bargaining easier—so that more agreements are able to be made and more workers are left better off. We see that the changes we're making to the better off overall test will ensure that the Fair Work Commission gives significant weight to the views of the parties—that it considers actual and reasonably foreseeable work arrangements, not hypothetical ones, and it considers the overall benefits to workers.</span>

Until we get to the core of the industrial relations problem, the government's proposed changes add needless complexity and transfer the risk from big business to small business. When will the Morrison government admit its role, through six years of inaction, in enabling big mining companies, labour hire firms and the Hunter Valley CFMMEU to collude in redefining the term 'casual' and then in exploiting casual workers? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

So I acknowledge your longstanding and abiding concern for those individuals. I'm not familiar with the advice on this matter that you received in Townsville from the CFMMEU legal adviser, Senator, but it is not the case that the government agrees with the characterisation that has been made. The government's view is that these initiatives and this reform in fact will contribute in a positive sense to responding to the economic crisis triggered by COVID-19.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that transparent scientific investigation of how this virus emerged is essential to preventing future global pandemics. Last week, the WHO-convened scientific team studying the origins of COVID-19 concluded its mission to Wuhan. Those investigations are, of course, critical. I particularly want to acknowledge and recognise the contribution of Australia's Professor Dominic Dwyer, a renowned microbiologist from Westmead Hospital in Western Sydney. Australia has consistently advocated for the expert scientific team visiting China to have access to all data, information and key locations relevant to their inquiries. Australia join our key partners—including UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan—in reiterating the need for full access to all information relevant to determining how this pandemic emerged. While there was a lengthy press conference at the conclusion of the mission last week, we are yet to see a formal report with findings, analysis and recommendations for future work. We will consider those scientific findings carefully when they are released, and Australia reiterates again the need for transparency and independence throughout this process. The World Health Assembly resolution of May last year delivered a very clear mandate: to identify the source of the COVID-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans. Our collective ongoing work is vital, as we all want to establish the origin and spread of this pandemic so that we can learn the lessons and prevent future devastating outbreaks of disease.</span>

What COVID-19, however, has shown is there is a need to strengthen and to reform the WHO. As a member of the WHO Executive Board, Australia has consistently advocated for the importance of principled collective action from the international community. I have discussed this work with the Director-General of the WHO, Dr Tedros, on a number of occasions and stated clearly that Australia will remain a constructive and pragmatic contributor to these efforts. Last month Australia joined the G7 and the Republic of Korea in calling for the strengthening and reform of the WHO to ensure that, with the continued strong support and involvement of its member states and the international community, it remains fit for evolving challenges.</span>

We've welcomed the independent panel's progress report of 19 January. Australia has advocated for strengthening the WHO's authority to quickly access and investigate an outbreak, and our national submission to the panel focused clearly on building an independent and authoritative WHO, reducing the risk of zoonotic disease transmission and strengthening WHO operations on the ground. The panel's progress report stated that the WHO's power to validate reports of disease outbreaks and deploy resources to affected areas is gravely limited. Following the WHO investigation team's media conference last week, Australia will continue to advocate for a review and a report that is both thorough and credible.</span>

Documents released under freedom of information have revealed that Minister Dutton announced two grants, worth $194,000, for two councils during the Braddon by-election. The grants were announced a month before the rules for the grants opened and went against the explicit advice of his own community safety experts, who warned they 'do not reflect the order of merit' and 'you may be criticised either in the media, or by the Australian National Audit Office'. Why did the minister ignore the advice of community safety experts and fund the grants?</span>

In issues such as this, the facts really matter. Let me share some of the facts with those opposite. This government is absolutely committed to making Australian communities safe places to live and to work. The Safer Communities Fund, provided to address crime and antisocial behaviour, helps communities to reduce violence and improve safety in local communities. Since 2016 the government has committed $180 million to this program.  Let me put a few facts on the record in relation to round 3 of the Safer Communities Fund. A total of 465 applications, totalling over $58 million, were received, for funding for approximately $17 million. Of these 465 applications, the Department of Home Affairs recommended that 70 be approved. Each of these applications that the department recommended received funding. The department also reckoned that Minister Dutton could select 15 from a reserve list of 210. All 210 of those applications had been assessed as suitable for funding. In fact, to enable these to be funded, the minister himself reduced a number of grants to enable funding to a number in Labor seats. For example, Nick Champion, the member for Spence, funded six CCTVs under these savings. Catherine King, the member for Ballarat, also funded four fixed CCTVs. And the list goes on and on. In fact, the spending between Labor and coalition seats is almost identical.</span>

It was, again, in response to that terrible terrorist attack in Melbourne, because the National Retail Association applied for funding under the protecting crowded places project, which assists retailers to deter, delay and respond to a terrorist attack. That is a convenient fact that you have left out, noting the significant events affecting the public and retailers over the month of November 2018. His office asked the Department of Home Affairs to consider this proposal and have the Department of Finance cost it. It was assessed and recommended to be funded, as it represented value for money and a proper use of Commonwealth resources, consistent with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. It was used, and again you conveniently don't recall that this was used for a most important response to a terrorist attack.</span>

I think everyone in this place understands the huge contribution that the construction sector has always played in being a key pillar of our economy, and it is a very essential pillar of our economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The Morrison government's HomeBuilder program is providing Australians with grants to build new homes or to renovate existing homes. I'm pleased to say that, as of 31 December 2020, more than 83,000 households had applied for this particular grant. I'm also pleased to inform the chamber that 80 per cent of the applications have been for new home construction. In your home state of Queensland, Senator Rennick, there have been more than 18,000 applications to this program. That has been absolutely fundamental in assisting the state's building industry. The ABS is now reporting that approvals for private sector houses rose by 7.5 per cent in December, reaching the highest levels that we've seen since 1994.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset of the pandemic, sales of houses virtually stopped overnight and up to 500,000 jobs across many industries were put at risk. But, as we ended 2020, new home sales were up 32.5 per cent compared to the previous year, a remarkable turnaround thanks to this amazing program and the investment that we've made in the construction industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">HomeBuilder was created as a stimulus to increase confidence and encourage buyers back into the market as the devastating impacts of the coronavirus pandemic started to hit the market. We can now say with no doubt whatsoever that the HomeBuilder program has well and truly exceeded our expectations and its goals and has kept hundreds of thousands of tradies in work who otherwise would have been unemployed. We extended the program, and we are delighted—</span>

That is why, as the government, we have given young Australians the mechanism and confidence to invest in their future. Saving for a deposit can be particularly difficult, so our First Home Loan Deposit Scheme helps Australians to buy their first house by making their deposit as little as five per cent. As part of our economic plan to rebuild our economy, the scheme was extended to allow an additional 10,000 young Australians who are buying their first home to be able to access this particular program, with a guaranteed loan until 30 June 2021. </span>

What I did confirm was that throughout this I took all of the relevant advice from ministerial and parliamentary services. That information was communicated to my staff member and included my recommendation to her that she consider talking to the AFP and seeking advice from them, which again is something that I facilitated for her. In terms of any further detail on that, I will seek advice because it is the subject, I've been advised, of an ongoing AFP investigation into the matter, which was opened in April 2019, and it is my advice that that investigation is still open or at least ongoing, so I do need to make sure that I do not prejudice anything that she may have decided to do then and now.</span>

Australia is proud to be offering full COVID-19 vaccine coverage for the Pacific and Timor-Leste in close partnership with New Zealand, the United States and France. We are committing $523.2 million over three years to a COVID-19 vaccine access health initiative for the Pacific and South-East Asia. This funding complements the $80 million we previously committed to the multilateral Covax Facility Advance Market Commitment for developing countries. In South-East Asia we will work with partners, like the World Bank, to meet the needs of much larger populations in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This initiative will provide safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and support health security in our region. Safety and effectiveness are critically important. We will only support the rolling out of vaccines to our neighbours once the vaccines have been approved by a stringent regulatory authority and countries are adequately prepared to administer the right vaccines for their local conditions. Senator Payne and I are in regular contact with our counterparts in the Pacific and South-East Asia to underline our commitment and to progress the next steps of our cooperation on vaccine access and rollouts in their nations. We expect that vaccines procured by the Covax Facility AMC will be the first available to countries in our region. Gavi and the WHO's best estimate is the AMC will begin to supply before the end of March 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to recognise that our Pacific partners have handled this situation extremely well so far. This is a testament to the incredible leadership across our region. Our focus is on trying to save lives and livelihoods. Access to WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines will help economies reopen and ensure stability. Our regional vaccine initiative will enable the purchase of vaccines by our neighbouring countries and will provide them with the necessary technical support to prepare for vaccine introduction. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our response is comprehensive in that it delivers not only access to vaccines but also critical economic support to countries in our region that have been profoundly affected by COVID-19. Our vaccine access initiative will deliver a holistic package of end-to-end support. It's not just for the procurement of WHO-approved vaccines; we're providing technical assistance and logistical support, such as training of health workers and cold-chain storage, as well as the development of national immunisation policies. Economic measures will support health security and social stability and help drive economic recovery across the region. They're also designed to protect the most vulnerable, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including women, girls and those with a disability.</span>

This coordination is critical to ensure our Pacific family can have access to vaccines that are safe and effective and can be accessed to support the economic recovery of the region. We believe that Australia and the region will not be safe until everybody is safe. That is why we are making a significant global contribution to ensuring that all of our close partners have access to safe and effective WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines and have full international support to deliver them.</span>

ACTU secretary Sally McManus pretty much summed it up when she said, 'The economy, local businesses will not be able to recover if workers are facing pay cuts.' She was of course talking about the plans of this government to cut the wages and conditions of workers in this country under IR laws. She went on to say: 'Families need the confidence to spend. You can't heal the economy by hurting working people.'</span>

'We've got to put down our weapons,' he declared. Well, it's quite clear now that the Morrison government has picked up those weapons and is armed to the teeth. Its plan is a pathway for employers to cut pay due to the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses, to wipe out back-pay claims for misclassified casuals and to have so-called flexibility for part-time workers to pick up shifts without overtime rates.</span>

The government wants to suspend rules that prevent enterprise agreements from undercutting minimum award standards. Just to put this change into perspective: it wasn't even discussed—it wasn't even on the agenda—at the government's 'We're all in this together' IR meetings last year. We know that suspending the BOOT will result in cuts to take-home pay for one in four workers that are covered by enterprise agreements. Weaker BOOT protections will spur a wave of new enterprise agreements, allowing employers further opportunity to suppress labour costs, which are already tracking at their slowest pace in postwar history.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government's proposal would also allow part-time employees covered by the 12 awards in the retail, food and accommodation industries to work extra shifts at ordinary rates, without the overtime loading. This has been referred to as 'part-time flexibility', but in truth we all know that it's casual employment by another name. Allowing extra work without overtime will cut take-home pay. This will allow employers to effectively use part-time workers as yet another form of casual labour. This government believes that any job can be casual so long as workers are desperate enough to accept it. There can be no doubt that this will feed the further spread of insecure employment without paid leave entitlements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the news today we see that the proposal by the government on the bill has been labelled as an immediate threat to public health by a significant group of public health experts from the Australian National University. Casual workers, who have no sick leave, have already borne the brunt of this pandemic, and now the government is brazenly attempting to legislate to have as many casual workers as possible. In reality, the changes to both part-time and casual employment rules will discourage new hiring. If existing employees can't be costly flexed in line with employer needs, why would you hire anyone else?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has been spruiked by two 'hollow men'—marketing man Prime Minister Morrison and Attorney-General Mr Christian Porter—and it's a scam. The changes that it will introduce will be marketed by these hollow men as a trigger for post-pandemic job creation. But, again, that claim is hollow. It's a hollow claim made by hollow men. The statement that they made back in 2020 that 'we're all in this together' was very short lived. These are hollow men and they should leave IR alone. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  In relation to Senator Urquhart's reference to 'hollow', what is hollow and, more than that, disappointing—profoundly disappointing—is that we're in a position in this country where there are reasonable things that could be done to improve our industrial relations system that are in the best interests of employers and employees, that are fair and reasonable, that have checks and balances and that would promote more employment and, in particular, for young people who have not had the opportunity for employment that other people have had in our society, promote the opportunity for them to get their first job and to get experience. It's a real shame, a profound shame, that we can't come together and come up with a system of reforms to make it easier, not harder, for small business—in particular, small business—to take that step to hire that extra worker, to give that young person a go, to give young people more hours and to provide them with more opportunities and, therefore, more experience so that they can progress in their career, and in their life, with the benefit of that work. It's a real shame, I believe, that what are relatively modest proposals for IR reform have once again become bogged down by an ideological debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to casual workers, I'd just like to make the initial observation that I went back and looked at the 2009 Fair Work Act, and the definition of 'casual worker' in that act was totally unacceptable; it wasn't there. It wasn't there. I don't know what the thinking of the then government was at the time with respect to how they defined 'casual work' in the Fair Work Act. I'd love to know. I should maybe go back and have a look at the parliamentary record. But there was no definition of 'casual work'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the industrial reforms that are being put forward by the government, there actually is a definition of 'casual work'. Is that an issue? Do people have an issue with that—that casual work is work where there is 'no firm advance commitment' to ongoing work? It seems an absolutely fair definition to me. So this reform seeks to actually provide a definition of casual work. The implication of the then Labor government's abject failure to put in a definition of casual work is that so many small businesses have been absolutely blindsided by a decision of the courts. Small businesses paid someone who'd been hired as a casual worker the extra loading—because they're a casual worker, they're not getting annual leave et cetera, so they're paid the extra 25 per cent—only to then find out that the law did not consider them to be a casual worker and the business had a liability to pay those workers the entitlements which they missed out on, notwithstanding the fact that they'd been paid a 25 per cent loading. How any reasonable person can look at that set of circumstances and determine that reasonable and fair reform is not required is absolutely beyond me. What do those opposite think will happen if small businesses across this country face claims, years old, with respect to allegations that entitlements have to be paid out, when the 25 per cent loading was paid? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area that needs reform. It needs to be fixed. This is a problem. I call upon those opposite to actually address that particular problem of where a small business has paid someone the 25 per cent loading on the reasonable understanding that they're a casual, and then it's determined years later that they weren't a casual and that same person applies to be paid out their entitlements. What is your answer to that particular problem? That is the question that small businesses around this country are asking every day: if you do not support this change, what is your answer to the issue of double dipping? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the answer given by Senator Payne to a question asked by Senator Farrell. That was an interesting speech. I've got a bit of time for Senator Scarr, but I think he needs to have a look at some of the facts around what's happening out there in the workplace. In actual fact, it would be useful to look at what's happening with regard to the WorkPac case, the mining industry and labour hire. In the case of the mining industry, a decision was taken regarding workers who had clearly been ripped off. They were operating as permanent workers but being paid as casual workers; they were getting paid 40 per cent less for doing exactly the same work as the permanent employees standing beside them. Let's be very clear: a casual employee working for a labour hire company was being paid 40 per cent less than a permanent employee who was getting annual and sick leave entitlements, and all those protections you would expect from permanent employment. The decision in that court was clearly about employers double dipping. Of course, that decision was peculiar to the particular circumstances that the court considered. It considered the fact that those workers received rosters 12 months in advance. I don't know too many small employers who give rosters 12 months in advance. I can understand why they wouldn't. I don't see many employers in many other industries giving rosters 12 months in advance. But, if you do, maybe the WorkPac case does apply to you, and you've been double dipping and ripping off casuals, just like what's happening in the resources industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to hope that those opposite just don't understand. I'd like to hope that they don't really know because they don't really look at the consequences; they read the propaganda sheet that they receive. Unfortunately, too many of them clearly understand too well that this is an attack on job security for part-time workers by casualising their performance. When an employer in the real world says, 'I'd like you to do your part-time overtime at flat rates, and you have one of two choices,' the person says either no or yes. And everyone knows what happens, in too many circumstances, when you say no to your employer. If you do say yes, what happens to the other part-time worker who's receiving those overtime payments for the exact same role? Funnily enough, the person receiving the proper penalty and exercising their proper rights is not employed, is not engaged. It's not true to say that every employer operates that way. But, when they do, their competitors have no other option but to meet the market requirements. If one player and rips off part-time workers in one market and gets a cheaper rate, then those companies that are competing are under pressure to take the exact same steps. How can it possibly be seen in isolation? When someone makes that decision in a workplace, it's not in isolation, and it isn't in isolation across a market. So, when decent employers, good employers, thoughtful employers don't want to go down that course, there is a consequence. That gets us down to the BOOT test. You know, bad business are licking their lips at this bill. They can't believe their luck. Some are even coming forward with suggestions of how they could take money from workers. McDonald's even put in a submission that they should be allowed to cut their workers' pay if the workers eat some chicken nuggets on their break—the old company store approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill that the government is talking about is part of the government's multipronged attack on Australian workers. I note Senator Bragg is spearheading the attack on workers' superannuation. Let's not have dignity in retirement, heaven forbid; that's the premise of the well-off and parliamentarians. He believes that cutting your superannuation will somehow trickle into your pay, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Perhaps he can work with McDonald's on their plan to not pay superannuation but to give people fries. The BOOT test, as has been proposed by the government, clearly is a substantial wage cut. Any simple review of the proposals from this government shows that they cut wages on penalties, on shift allowances, on annual leave payments. There is a cut right across public holidays. There's all that capacity to have that effect. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  It is like groundhog day time and again. I have never seen an IR scare campaign that the Labor Party can't get behind. Really, that is what is so sad and desperate when it comes to the modern Labor Party. I would like to support Senator Scarr in his comments. Potentially, what is the most disappointing part of the modern Labor Party is their inability to ever have a sensible discussion about reform. They are totally incapable of looking at any changes without running back to the old scare campaign tactics. I don't know why we are surprised. When you look at those opposite and those in the other place, at times you start to wonder and question whether or not it is la-la land that they live in when it comes to running a business, when it comes to employing staff. We know having ever run a business, having ever employed people, having ever faced the burdens of red tape—having looked at the challenges of being every part of a business from payroll to marketing to HR—is not part of their preselection criteria. We on this side know that those opposite and those who sit on the opposition benches in the other place have little to no understanding of the challenges of small business, and that is completely obvious when you look at the way they have politicised and tried to respond to the current COVID pandemic and to the efforts the Morrison government has made in securing small business's future and in ensuring that those small businesses are able to survive and rebuild on the other side of this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, watching Sally McManus be the spokesperson for Labor, the spokesperson for industrial relations reform, when we know there is not an employer that Sally McManus wouldn't like to see the back of, there seemed to be this disconnect when it came down to it. Labor want to talk about jobs, they want to talk about pay and conditions, but they just want to demonise all employers. There is an inability to accept from Labor that employers are the people who create jobs. We can support employers and ensure their businesses can succeed, we can cut red tape, we can make it easier for those businesses to do what they're good at—conduct their core business—so that more jobs will be created boosting the opportunities and options for all Australian workers. But, of course, 'options', like 'choice', is a dirty word for the Labor Party. Why do the Labor Party hate choice? Why do they think Australian workers are so incapable that they can't make a decision? What's better for them? Is it better to receive loadings, to continue working as a casual? Is it better to move to a permanent position?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But why do the Labor Party have so little faith that Australians and Australian workers are able to make that choice? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do they think it's appropriate to cut casuals' wages, if that's how they choose to remain, by on average $153 a week? I am looking forward to Mr Albanese, the opposition leader, coming out and explaining to workers why, whilst removing their choice, he determines they should take, on average, a $153 pay cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this will be about choice; there will be an option for workers. We know that this flies in the face of the groupthink ideology so embraced by Labor that unions know best: 'Do as we tell you.' When we look at the behaviour of some of the union bosses, we know it's: 'Do as I say, not as I do. We know best for you. Big Brother will look after you; don't you worry about that. Don't challenge your little head with any of those independent thoughts.' But, again, we can't see a Labor Party here that's actually looking out for workers, because we know what it is about. It's only about one job in the country, and it's a job that's looking very shaky at the moment. This is all about the job of opposition leader Anthony Albanese. That's perhaps why now, after the industrial relations spokesperson for Labor, Tony Burke, came out, declaring that all Australians in insecure work should be able to take all their leave entitlements with them, at a cost to business of up to $20 billion a year, we see Mr Burke running away from that a little bit. Perhaps that's as he's trying to remain as supportive of his neighbour Chris Bowen as he looks to the future of his own career. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  When asked today about why the government's new IR laws are designed to make insecure work even more entrenched, the government again ignored the expert advice of 23 law professors in this country who say that these IR laws will not only fail to address the wage stagnation that is absolutely plaguing our economy at the moment and fail to address the insecure work that so many Australians face today but in fact actually exacerbate these problems. Again the government has decided to ignore these 23 law experts today. They've decided today to double-down on their tired old false claims—false claims that we've heard over and over and over again from that side of politics and false claims that somehow cutting pay is important to boosting jobs. Somehow cutting pay is going to boost jobs and boost the economy—that is the tired old play from this Liberal government. They have doubled-down on false claims today that making more Australians casual and insecure is going to somehow boost the economy and false claims that somehow scrapping the better off over all test is going to magically leave Australians better off overall, when it is clearly designed to leave Australians worse off, apparently, according to this government, in service of a stronger economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians see through this Liberal government's spin. They know that, in the middle of this health crisis and in the middle of an economic crisis, the Liberal government is actually just reaching into the bottom drawer to pull out their tired old playbook and to pull out their tired old plans—attacks on workers, attacks on unions, attacks on people's basic rights at work, cuts to workers' pay and cuts to workers' rights. That is the recipe that this government has for Australians to get through this pandemic and to set the economy on the right foot. Australians know better than to believe that. Australians know that they have faced persistently low wages under this government, even before the pandemic, and they know that Scott Morrison's response to this industrial relations bill will only make that problem worse. A pay cut is not going to help the stagnant wages of Australians. Casualising more Australians is not going to address the epidemic that we have of insecure work in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages were flatlining under this government even before COVID-19, and it is a big problem. It's a big problem for workers who can't afford to put food on the table for themselves and their families and it's a big problem for the economy as a whole. What we actually need is for people to have pay packets so they can open their wallets and spend in local businesses in their communities. That's what we actually need to get this economy moving. We need people to have secure jobs to get this economy moving. People need the security of a pay cheque next week, the week after and the week after that and they need hours of work next week, the week after and the week after that in order to be able to spend in local businesses in their communities and give our economy the boost it needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a culture problem in this building. How many more examples are we going to be faced with before this government does something about it? We saw this morning incredibly confronting reporting of an actual rape in this very building. That was almost two years ago now. The government has sought to sweep it under the carpet. In examining this issue today I had cause to trawl through history. There have been so many other examples. I'm so disheartened that there still seems to be no action to fix either the culture of this place, and of the Liberal Party in particular, or, ideally, the systems that might prevent this or, at the very least, support survivors of sexual violence and assault.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question. Earlier today the Prime Minister belatedly stated that he 'regrets' if Ms Brittany Higgins, the woman who was raped in this building by a Liberal staff colleague, felt unsupported. That does not cut it. Ms Higgins deserves appropriate redress. She deserves a formal apology. She deserves an actual process to clean up this sordid mess so that no other woman has to be subjected to this sort of treatment in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister 'regrets' if she felt unsupported. Well, she did feel unsupported. You can imagine why. She was brought into her employer's office—the very office in which she was raped—and she said she was essentially told not to pursue the matter with police. She left that meeting with the implication that, if she did pursue this matter with police, her own career would be at stake. We know that that is such a common theme in these types of incidents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately the AFP got involved, but it has been almost two years and still we have seen no result. The government hasn't even admitted that there is a problem, let alone done anything about it. I asked the minister if they have a policy about this. I asked him if they reviewed that policy—if they even had one—after the example of Ms Higgins; after what happened with Ministers Tudge and Porter, which was recently revealed on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>; and after the examples of Ms Potter and Ms Mani, which was reported nigh on two years ago. The examples just keep coming. Where is the review of your inadequate policies?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister saw fit to bang on about the Employee Assistance Program. I'm sure it is a noble program, and, yes, it exists for everyone working under the MOP(S) Act to access, but this is hardly an appropriate response when I asked about Liberal Party policy and whether that has been reviewed to clean up the fact that women are not safe in this building. It is an entirely inadequate response. It is a dodge to the question and it is an insult to all survivors of sexual harassment, assault and rape in this workplace—and anywhere, for that matter. So I was extremely disappointed that the government had the opportunity to say they were doing something and didn't take that opportunity. The natural implication is that they're not doing anything about this. They just want these women to shut up and go away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Reynolds, who was the woman's employer at the time, was asked, 'What has happened to Ms Higgins?' and she ultimately conceded that Ms Higgins went to work for Minister Cash and might even have had a promotion. That's pretty rare; usually it's the woman who loses her job. One wonders whether or not this promotion, presumably with a slight pay increase, was the price Ms Higgins had to pay. Was that what she got so that she didn't speak out? It just boggles the mind that the government continue to think they can ignore this issue and do nothing about it. The Prime Minister didn't face the media today. That camera-loving Prime Minister, who loves to entertain us all with extremely lengthy press conferences, forwent that opportunity today. One wonders whether or not it is because he is complicit in this cover-up. He should be the person showing some leadership in tackling these issues, because they keep on happening, and yet there's nothing. There's a blandly worded statement where he's sorry—no, he's not even sorry; he 'regrets'—that she feels unsupported. What an absolute joke! I note Brittany said that when she saw the Prime Minister standing with the young Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, she felt sick in the stomach and thought the government were complicit in silencing her. They are. Fix it! Do better!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  On behalf of the Prime Minister, I table a ministerial statement on the anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the document.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we reflect on the anniversary of the apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples, given here in the Australian parliament, on Ngunawal land, 13 years ago. We take this opportunity to honour the local custodians, the Ngunawal people, and the First Peoples across all of our great southern land. I join the Prime Minister in thanking them and their elders, past, present and emerging, for 65,000 years of continuous stewardship of our land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also honour the immense contributions being made by our Indigenous parliamentary colleagues serving in this parliament. We honour the Minister for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister and the contributions they make to our nation. Here in this place we particularly honour Senator Patrick Dodson, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, Senator Lidia Thorpe and Senator Jacqui Lambie. Thank you for the work that you do. Each of you brings a crucially important perspective to this place, a perspective that adds knowledge and understanding to the deliberations and conversations not just in the formal chambers or committees of the parliament but, perhaps even more importantly, in the informal engagements had between one another. You also set a most crucial and valuable example. You provide, we hope, inspiration and hope to new generations of young Australians through the leadership roles that you play. I look forward to other Indigenous Australians joining us in this parliament in the years to come. Ultimately, we hope for it to be commonplace, rather than exceptional, to be serving alongside Indigenous women and men in our parliaments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This past weekend marked 13 years since then Prime Minister Rudd gave an apology on behalf of the nation to Australia's Indigenous people, particularly to the stolen generations. The apology was a moment for our country to take steps towards healing. It was a significant step in and of itself. I reiterate those words today: I am sorry for the injustices of the past; we are sorry as a parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we observe the anniversary of such a significant milestone in our nation's history, this is also an opportunity for us to reflect upon practices undertaken by governments in the past that wrongly sought to disrupt and indeed destroy the world's longest-living culture. We pay respect to those members of the stolen generations, to the survivors and to those who have followed in their footsteps and those who are no longer with us; to the victims of past government policies that forced removal and cultural assimilation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A state that acted with absolute control over Aboriginal people's lives without even recognising them as citizens was, clearly, a mark of shame. The apology was our opportunity as Australians to say it was wrong for parliaments and governments to remove Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families and communities and their country just because they were Indigenous. As Minister Wyatt so rightly put it over the weekend, the occasion of this anniversary is an opportunity for us to acknowledge the terrible loss and suffering and to remark upon the resilience and determination of those who worked so hard to ensure wrongs were acknowledged and to preserve the culture of their peoples and nations into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What followed the national apology was an effort to close the gap. In the decade that followed, we saw mixed results and an inconsistency in outcomes. As education minister, I was pleased to see positive progress towards the closing the gap targets in terms of the targets around year 12 educational attainment. Such steps in education provide encouragement and some hope for the future, but elsewhere there was a failure to achieve the scale of progress or the permanent change the nation aspired to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July last year, we signed a new national agreement on closing the gap, an agreement reached through a historic partnership between Australian governments and Indigenous peak organisations. We understand that the best outcomes occur when governments and Indigenous Australians work together. This agreement marks a new chapter in our efforts and, echoing the comments of the Prime Minister, 'a new chapter in our efforts—one built on mutual trust, respect and dignity'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Progress is being made as we, across Australia, think differently and recraft our approach, but we know there is so much more to do. On 9 January, Minister Wyatt launched the second stage of the Indigenous Voice co-design process. I thank Professor Marcia Langton and Professor Tom Calma for their work alongside more than 52 members across three co-design groups. I encourage all Australians, especially all 800,000 Indigenous Australians, to provide their feedback to that process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation and a parliament, we continue to reflect on our shared history and to mark the hope of that day 13 years ago. Changes across a country like Australia can happen at all levels, from governments through to citizens. I would like to acknowledge the very thoughtful, personal and thought-provoking journey shared by ABC journalist Ellen Fanning of her discovery of two Indigenous women, Angelina McKenzie and Maria Koosney, who were sent to undertake forced employment with Ellen's great-grandfather. Ellen's research led to a meeting with Maria's granddaughter and great-granddaughter, Christine Stuart and Loraine Franks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll quote Ellen's article. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After five hours of exchanging photographs and stories, two Queensland families sweating and smiling, there is still one more thing left to say. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"My family owes a debt of gratitude to your family," I begin, "because when they came from England and Ireland, they had nothing. They were pretty much illiterate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"And off the back of the work and the knowledge of country that your family brought, my family is educated and where we are today. So, is 'thank you' the right thing to say?" </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Of course it is, Ellen … You cannot blame the children of today for what the elders did yesterday," Loraine says. "As far as I am concerned, my mother would be smiling down on us now. I really mean that."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Loraine shows an amazing generosity of kindness and forgiveness that offers remarkable hope. So many Indigenous Australians have shown such resilience, such kindness, such forgiveness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On days like today, we acknowledge the wrongs of what have happened and together seek to work to ensure it doesn't happen to future generations. The apology brought this parliament and the nation closer together and recognised the significant contribution Indigenous Australians had made and continue to make to this great nation. Today we reaffirm our commitment and lean into that shared hope of a future in which we are one and we walk together in the pursuit of a better future for all and a better understanding amongst all. I thank the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="SR5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  Thirteen years ago I had just returned to Australia from South Africa. I had left this country disgusted and angry at the political obfuscation, fabrication and outright denial around the removal of Aboriginal children from their mothers and families, and the refusal to acknowledge, apologise and compensate for what governments had done under political cover to hide the genocide that had been perpetrated—taking Aboriginal children away, breaking their links to culture and community and forcing an assimilation scheme upon them. Should anyone care to challenge my use of the word 'genocide', let me point to article II of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The convention was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 and ratified by Australia the next year. Article II of the convention prescribes acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Among those acts prescribed were 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part' and 'forcibly transferring children of the group to another group'. As uncomfortable as the definition might be, that is the definition of the United Nations, and Australia ratified that convention in 1949, almost 70 years ago. The Human Rights Commission <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report was quite explicit. The forcible removal of children from Aboriginal Australians to other groups for the purposes of raising them separately from and ignorant of their culture and people was properly labelled genocidal in the breaching of binding international law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have very vivid memories of the late Sir Ronald Wilson and my brother Mick Dodson, his co-commissioner, launching the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report at the reconciliation convention in Melbourne in May 1997. It was a moment of national truth-telling that the Howard government could not handle. Its reaction was to deny that these awful things had ever happened to Aboriginal people in this country and, if they had happened, somehow or other it was for the good of the children involved. There was no need to apologise about what happened and certainly no need to compensate them for this sanctioned activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those children was an old friend of mine, Mr Frank Byrne, who was taken from his family in 1943. I was reminded of the wretchedness he experienced throughout his whole life when only last week I penned a forward to his memoir to be published later this year. Frank was just six years old when the authorities dumped him at Moola Bulla Station in the Kimberley, which was run by the Western Australian government. In his early teens he was told his mother had died, but that was a blatant, dreadful lie. He spent the rest of his life trying to find out what had happened to her only to learn in later years that she had not died until 1962. Frank's grief was overwhelming. This wrench from his mother haunted him until his death in 2017, and his writing about this sense of loss will move many people to tears. An injury prevented Frank from coming to Canberra to hear Kevin Rudd's Apology to the Stolen Generations 13 years ago, but he said he was able to witness it from his home in Alice Springs. In his memoir, which I have been proud to promote, he writes: 'I thought this man is genuine. He had guts to come out and say this wonderful thing.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was able to be here in Canberra when Prime Minister Rudd made the apology. I sat in the other place with Mrs Vincenti, whom I had met during the Aboriginal deaths in custody inquiry in Western Australia. Mrs Vincenti had been taken as a young girl to the notorious Roelands Mission near Bunbury in Western Australia. Tragically, her son had been shot at Canning Vale prison while he was in custody. The apology was the first time we'd heard of the idea of closing the gap and life expectancy and of measures to bring equality between First Australian nations and the wider population. This was also a time when we were told that a new chapter in our relationship was to be written, starting with a blank page, but the only new ink on this blank page in these last 13 years has been the pleas of the First Nations peoples in the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we heard the Prime Minister and Minister Wyatt say that there's a new deal that involves buy-in from the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and from the peak Aboriginal organisations, a COAG agreement that has not formulated implementation plans yet. So we'll be waiting until August until we learn if anything is, in fact, going to be done and is going to improve the situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know, and there's empirical evidence to back this up, is just how damaging those policies were of forcibly removing and damaging those thousands of stolen generation peoples. They continue to suffer to this day. A study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found they have experienced a range of adverse health, cultural and socioeconomic outcomes at a rate higher—higher!—than Indigenous populations that were not removed. For example, members of the stolen generations are more than three times likely to be incarcerated than other Indigenous peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disadvantage and trauma doesn't end with the stolen generations themselves. Their families, too, have poor health and poor social outcomes. The same Institute of Health and Welfare report, for example, found that their descendants are 1½ times as likely to have been arrested in the past five years than those of First Nations peoples whose families were not removed. No wonder that Mrs Vincenti's son was in jail when he was killed; he was almost fated to have been incarcerated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the delivery of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and Indigenous people are still being locked up at scandalous rates and Aboriginal children are being removed from their families in shocking numbers. Twenty-four years after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home report</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>First Nations children are nearly 10 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care in Australia and more than 20,000 First Nations children are in out-of-home care. That's about 37 per cent of the total number of children in out-of-home care, yet First Nations children represent only six per cent of the child population in Australia. As shocking as these figures are, they are getting worse. It is urgently incumbent upon all of us to make the services available to help families, not just to remove kids. I acknowledge that the new Closing the Gap targets recognise this crisis in the criminal justice and child protection areas, but those targets will continue to be unachievable without adequate investment by all governments, including the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am gripped by a real sense of despair on occasions like this. We wait and we wait and nothing gets done. We get promises and promises and promises; nothing gets done. What will it take for this country to confront the awful realities of its history and fix these continuing fundamental wrongs? Well, let me tell you what a good start might be, apart from setting some new targets. To the other side I say: open your hearts and embrace in full the plea of the Uluru Statement from the Heart for voice, treaty and truth. We can only be enriched, not diminished, if we do. This is the gap that has to be diminished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  We don't have sound for Senator Thorpe. I'll get the technicians to contact you, Senator Thorpe. Senator Wong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how Kevin Rudd began the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. It was a day of national catharsis, a day of national healing and, most of all, a day of national hope. In the House of Representatives, on the lawns outside and across the country, we Australians embraced in a way we never had before, because we embraced one another without armour, in honesty, in truth—the conditions of respect. It was the starting point for an equal stake. Yet too often when parliamentarians have recognised the anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations there have been attempts to comfort our conscience and say, 'Well, we have a long way to go, but look how far we've come.' We need no more of that. We diminish the apology, this watershed moment of truth-telling, if we conceal failure and neglect in self-gratifying fictions that we are moving forward. In fact, it's hard to see how we are moving much at all. On this year's anniversary of the national apology, we look at how far we have not come and we reproach this government, which appears perfectly at peace with its own inertia on reconciliation and on closing the gap with First Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This past Saturday was the 13th anniversary of the apology, but for years now work on closing the gap, the voice to parliament and makarrata has been stalled. In last year's <span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">losing the g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap</span> report, five of the seven targets—child mortality, literacy and numeracy, school attendance, employment and life expectancy—weren't on track. Last year's <span style="font-style:italic;">Family matters</span> report, more than a decade after the apology, showed the alarming rates at which Indigenous children are being removed from their families now: 37.3 per cent of all children removed. The Morrison government promised a referendum for constitutional recognition. They promised it, but they won't commit. They won't commit to a time line. They won't commit to doing the work to make the referendum a success. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate the offer made by Mr Albanese, Senator Dodson and Ms Burney, the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, who is here today, that Labor wants to work constructively to achieve a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament. We don't care who gets the credit, but we do want to get it done—and there is time to get it done now. All of us in this place should be determined to see all three elements of the statement: the constitutionally enshrined voice, treaty-making and truth-telling overseen by a makarrata commission. Senator Dodson, the father of reconciliation, has put a motion on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> to establish a Joint Select Committee on Makarrata. I know he's seeking agreement with Minister Wyatt. I say to the government: express your support. I say to government senators: express your support in the party room. It's not so much to ask. It costs you so little. The Uluru statement as a whole is not much to ask, frankly. In fact, we should be humbled and gracious that a people who have had everything taken from them are willing to meet us on these terms. These are terms that cost us nothing and ask us only to demonstrate some humility and some grace ourselves. It is time for those opposite to demonstrate some humility and some grace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The apology was recommended in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report, which Senator Dodson has spoken about. The then Prime Minister, John Howard, resisted it for the following 10 years. Let's remember the ridiculing of those who acknowledged the facts of our past as having a 'black armband' view, the opposition to the apology—all this despite the community support that is best remembered by and exemplified in those reconciliation walks in the year 2000. Nelson Mandela visited Australia that year. He said the quarter of a million people-strong Sydney Harbour Bridge walk showed a country wanting to heal itself and deal with the hurt of the past. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Leaving wounds unattended leads to its festering and eventually causes greater injury to the body of society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Mandela well understood from the South African experience what we call makarrata. Then, of course, in 2008, in one of his earliest acts as Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd moved the national apology, and the Nelson opposition went along with it. After eight years in government, it's time the Liberals showed they meant it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike John Howard, today's Liberals don't huff and puff and dig in their heels. Instead, they just say they care, they talk about how important it is to get it right, but they don't deliver. The current Prime Minister uses similar but more subtle arguments than his Liberal predecessor about not getting stuck in the past. Well, it is irrelevant that the past can't be changed because it lives on. We receive the past as material and emotional inheritance, whether it be abundance or deprivation. We receive it as a system that continues to mete out disadvantage and advantage by the same formula it always has, unless we take steps to change it. You see, this is how systemic racism works, and we do talk about that now as much as we talk about individual acts of racial prejudice. That is a positive development, because it helps us understand that racism is not just seen in explicit acts of abuse or violence. It is also manifest in culture, law and policy. If you don't believe me, have a look around and ask whether this place, and many other centres of power in Australia, look like today's Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great thing for our Labor caucus to have Pat Dodson, Linda Burney and Malarndirri McCarthy in it. It deeply enriches us. We welcome those other members of parliament and senators—Mr Wyatt, Senator Thorpe, Senator Lambie—but alongside representation the rest of us also need to act, and in this place, in the parliament of Australia, we actually have the means to move the needle, we have the means to help the nation heal, and we have the means to tackle systematic intergenerational Indigenous disadvantage. So, if we don't have the will, what does it say about us? If you want to sit on the government benches but you're not going to insist that your cabinet and Prime Minister do better then what does it say about you?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national apology was the start, but a government that wants to claim legitimacy in the sweep of this country's history must make sure it was not the end. If you want Australia to succeed as a nation and as a family, we must all have the equal stake in it that Prime Minister Rudd called for and that our Indigenous people have called for. So I again extend Labor's offer to work together to close the gap and to achieve constitutional recognition for voice, treaty and truth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  [by video link] I rise to contribute on the anniversary of the apology to the stolen generation mob, and members out there are listening today. My mother was also co-commissioner with Sir Ronald Wilson at that time and is still affected by the hundreds and hundreds of stories that she sat through at the time of that inquiry. The impacts continue, and the stealing of children continues today in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind everybody that a lot has been said about systemic racism in the lead up to 26 January and after 26 January, particularly in my home state of Victoria. Senator Wong briefly touched on the fact that this is a system of colonisation and that this is systematic racism that continues in our society today. We heard Senator Dodson talk about there being over 20,000 Aboriginal children in out-of-home care today in 2021. Saying 'sorry' means you don't do it again, yet the numbers increase and the destruction and desecration of our families, our communities and the parents of those children continues in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Few people understand what systemic racism is. It was systemic racism and white supremacy that made the colonisers steal our children, ripping them as babies from their mothers. AO Neville, the white supremacist that was one of the architects of the White Australia policy, was very clear that the point of this evil policy was to end our people—eradicate First Peoples from these lands and our culture with them. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Are we going to have one million blacks in the Commonwealth or are we going to merge them into our white community and eventually forget that there were any Aborigines in Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Systemic racism, or institutional racism, is the idea that white superiority—the false idea that white is right—is captured in the everyday thinking of people and how our society operates. Australia is a place that is racist to its very foundations, but funnily enough there are no racists at all to be found in this country. The same people who recoil at being called racist are the same ones who do not care enough or, at least, are happy to accept that our people die almost 10 years before anyone else—and that's okay because that's just how things are, right? Racism in this country operates and bears down across all of society and is deeply embedded in our laws, and everyone just seems to act as if this is fine and normal. That's what systemic racism is. It's the racism that is built into the systems we work and live in. This type of racism is so insidious because it's designed to be invisible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Racism is baked into the system, from the White Australia policy and the race powers in the Constitution to the fact that our people could not all vote in the country until 1965, despite having bled and died for you in both world wars. Systemic racism is evident in the fact that we were constitutionally barred from being officially counted in the census until '67. This parliament was happy for us to not even count on our own country. That's systemic racism. It's the rusted-on racism that is inescapable. We have been living with it since the colonisers came to build their prison on our lands and waters. They raped our women and children. They poisoned our waterholes and forced us to eat their toxic food. The colonisers chained us, beat us, imprisoned us and tried to eradicate us from our own country for their own profits. They also stole our children. They took our babies. I got a message just this morning about another baby that's been taken away at the hospital bed before its mother could even begin breastfeeding. Then these colonisers, these foreigners, told us that they were doing this for our own good, and they still do. The vile racist AO Neville said that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… they have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not. They cannot remain as they are. The sore spot requires the application of the surgeon's knife for the good of the patient, and probably against the patient's will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we actually needed protection from was colonisation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The colonising governments of this country stole our children. Let's sit with that for a moment. The governments of this country stole our children, as an act of genocide. Ten per cent of our children who were born before the seventies were stolen by the governments of this country. Those children were enslaved, raped, abused, set to work and kept separate from their families, their cultures and their country. So many of them are still looking for their families. So many more died not knowing who they came from or where their ancestral homes were.</span>

I'm not allowed to be angry, despite having plenty of reasons to be. Our people have been pushed to experience the worst social, health, education and employment outcomes of anyone in this country. Our sacred places have been destroyed by both sides of the chamber, our sites have been poisoned and our totems have been killed and continue to be killed today. Our people are the most imprisoned people on earth. Having a constitutionally enshrined voice won't fix that. We have a war on our hands, between white Australia and black Australia, and the only thing that will rectify that is a peace treaty to bring peace and to give us seats in parliament, not a voice to parliament. My heart, my soul and my condolences to all those who've been affected by the genocidal act of stealing our children from our families, our communities and our country. We will continue to rebuild as this nation's First People.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  This is the national apology remembrance. In 2008 the Stolen Generations received a national apology for the wrongs done to them by previous governments. As a nation we learned a lot when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report was released in 1997, and we have continued to learn in the years since. That report revealed the tragedies of many of those children, who were often terribly abused, neglected and unloved. The apology affirmed our nation's agreement that we should never accept or condone the removal of children from their families based on race. But today, as I stand in this place, I am deeply saddened by the knowledge that we have much more to be sorry for around our treatment of Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike many of the most vocal urban Aboriginal activists, I have visited remote Aboriginal communities throughout Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. I've seen for myself how governments turn a blind eye to at-risk Aboriginal children. I have sat with elders and learned firsthand what they need and what they want in order to rid their communities of the evils of violence, abuse, alcohol and drugs. And I've seen how children are repeatedly returned to parents who persistently abuse or neglect them, parents who demonstrate a complete inability to deliver the care and attention those children so desperately need. We're talking about abuse and neglect that would make your toes curl: rampant alcohol and drug abuse; interfamily and domestic violence, some of the worst you will ever see; the starvation and malnutrition of children; the denial of education because too many Aboriginal parents refuse to send their children to school; and, worst of all, prostitution and paedophilia involving, reportedly, children as young as two—and all this in 21st century Australia, in one of the most economically and socially advanced countries on the planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do governments of today refuse to remove at-risk children from these households? Why are they afraid to treat at-risk Indigenous children the same way they treat non-Indigenous children every day of the week, to protect children in any city or town in Australia? Why do they shame us all as a nation by not reaching out effectively and saving the lives and futures of these children and their communities? Like many Australians, I believe both sides of politics are all too afraid of being labelled as creators of a second stolen generation, as false as that accusation would be. They lack the courage and the will to act, in the face of the cancel culture, on behalf of these children and the families who desperately cry out for rapid and empowering solutions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So my apology is to today's Indigenous victims, the ones who live with and suffer from the horrors of child molesters; they are the ones who today, as we gather here, are breaking into people's homes to steal food from fridges. Today I'm saying sorry to all the Aboriginal children who should be spending their first few weeks in prep or primary school, but their parents simply don't care enough to get them there. I'm sorry for the children of parents who have told me they feel ashamed of their own lack of education and, tragically, can't support a world where their kids will earn more than them. I'm sorry for the sit-down money that we're paying a growing number of Aboriginal parents who have no inspiration to improve their own lives, let alone their children's, through meaningful employment. I'm also sorry for those Indigenous kids who have never been tucked into bed by loving parents but are instead ignored by those who are too busy drinking to worry where their kids are late at night. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator Waters! I'm listening very carefully. There is a tension between the rules guaranteeing almost absolute free speech in this chamber and the rules on negative reflections on other senators. I'm going to take some advice on the words that have been used here and I will come back to the chamber. I will also say that there are also standards that don't have to be reflected in rules, as I've often said, that can actually ensure the nature of good debate in this chamber. So, Senator Hanson, I'm not going to rule that that was an unparliamentary reflection. I will take advice because that was not absolutely clear from my understanding of the standing orders, but I will check the words very carefully. If it assigns a motive or imputes a motive, I will deem it unparliamentary. If it is a criticism of action then I'm afraid I don't think, as a general rule, that that can be deemed unparliamentary. But I will very carefully review the words. Senator Hanson, I'm also going to ask you to consider from this point forward, in the remainder of your speech, the rules on reflecting on other senators, because we do have stricter rules on reflections on members of the Senate and members of the House than we do on general comment.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I believe with all my heart that we can help create champions out of our Indigenous children—champions who go on to become contributing members of their communities and the broader working Australian society; champions who are proud to be Australian; champions who also insist on improving the health, education and prospects of future generations; champions who do not see themselves as victims. But most politicians in this place will only ever run decoy to the real issues plaguing modern First Nations Australians. </span>

We must show courage and determination to provide the opportunities and pathways that will protect and empower all young Australians. We must call out the cowardice and the manipulation of the truth-denying elites who seek to keep any group of Australians trapped in permanent victimhood. We should behave like the advanced First World nation we are.</span>

Can I specifically acknowledge Minister Wyatt, Senator Dodson, Mrs Burney, Senator McCarthy, Senator Lambie and Senator Thorpe and pay my respects to them and all Indigenous Australians on this very important anniversary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirteen years ago the Australian government delivered the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. The then Prime Minister, Prime Minister Rudd, acknowledged and reflected on this blemished chapter of Australia's history. Thirteen years on we must not forget that, because it is as important today as it was then and has always been. Today is an opportunity, as a government, to reflect on the national strategies to improve the outcomes for Indigenous Australians, through improved policy implementation informed by the voices of Indigenous Australians. It is an opportunity as a community and as community representatives to work hand in hand with local champions to promote the world's longest-living culture. Painfully and most importantly, it is a moment to acknowledge the tremendous loss and suffering of First Nations peoples and what they have experienced. As the Prime Minister said today, actions of brute force were carried out under claims of good intentions but, in truth, betrayed the ignorance of arrogance—knowing better than our Indigenous peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the national apology came an effort to overcome inequality and shape an Australia where we close the gap between the life expectancy, educational achievements and economic opportunities of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. That challenge continues today. The Prime Minister has made it clear that Closing the Gap is a whole-of-government priority, and so it should be. We cannot look at these issues with a singular focus or with preconceived notions that fail to connect with realities on the ground. Major changes to systems, to policy and to practice will only be secured when Indigenous leaders and their communities are able to participate in and influence the decisions that affect their lives. This is central to some of the programs and initiatives that exist under my Social Services portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time, the Closing the Gap agreement includes targets to reduce the rate of overrepresentation of Indigenous children in out-of-home care. Our goal is to make sure we reduce that rate by 45 per cent by 2031. Right now there are approximately 20,000 Indigenous children in out-of-home care. By any measure, that is a very distressing figure and we must address it. So too is the tragic rate of domestic violence in our remote communities. Evidence indicates that Indigenous women and children experience disproportionately high rates of domestic violence. Everybody has the right to be safe in their community and that's why it is so essential that we are able to provide specialised family violence services to deliver culturally and age-appropriate family and domestic violence services to children and young people as well as to women who are victims of domestic violence. In order to make a long-term difference in the rates of violence against women, we also must change attitudes to violence. That is why it is very important that we invest in initiatives that work with our First Australians to make sure that, working with community elders, we can promote healthy and respective relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally important is to effect change in relation to the level of educational attainment. The government are committed to supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to access the best education possible as we continue to work together to close the gap in education. Under the Social Services portfolio, we continue to fund support to Indigenous children to start their schooling with cognitive development and skills comparable to those of their peers, improving their chances of completing their education.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  The national apology in 2008 was very much overdue. It was delivered years after every other state and territory issued their apologies. When it was finally delivered in this place, it was an important acknowledgement of the suffering and devastation wrought by past government policy, a policy of forcible removal and assimilation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The national apology was important for healing. But the horrible legacy of those callous policies continues to this day. The harm of being ripped away from family, land and culture passes through generations. An apology was important, but it was only a beginning and not an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On many fronts, we are still in the process of making amends. We are yet to close the gap on several health and social determinants, and, until that is done, the apology remains a symbolic act of unfinished business. There are so many adverse health and welfare ills that disproportionately afflict Indigenous people—for instance, rheumatic heart disease. In estimates last year, I asked what was being done nationally about this serious disease. Rheumatic fever and heart disease are rare in Australia unless you're Indigenous. Young children living in remote areas are at particular risk. It is absolutely a preventable condition. It is also a condition brought on by poverty, crowded living conditions and limited medical care. It seems incredible to me that we are battling what is essentially a Third World condition in a First World nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While today we commemorate the national apology, we can't simply mark the occasion in our collective calendars and then move on to business as usual. There are things that we can all do, things that we must do, starting with speaking up against casual racism when we see it and holding those in power to account. I'm confident we will eventually close the gap in attitudes, services and prospects. I am hopeful that, in my lifetime, all Indigenous people around Australia will be able to enjoy the same opportunities and life outcomes that many other Australians take for granted. But progress remains way too slow. Good intentions and the symbolism of the national apology are important, but what matters more is the action we take in response.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise to make a short contribution on this occasion marking the anniversary of the national apology. Far too many First Nations peoples are attending funerals in this country. I attend so many meetings where somebody's giving an apology because they have to be at a funeral. The apology brought such hope, and it was very important, but, unless we back it up, where are we heading in this country in closing the gap? While so many First Nations peoples are attending funerals for loved ones and friends who have passed away all too soon, and far too many children are still going into care, including in my home state of Western Australia, our appalling record shows the failures in our system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January, a First Nations mother in a regional town in Western Australia made a from-the-heart, emotional video about the situation affecting her son. It had to do with the interaction with the justice system, the discriminatory nature of policing, and the failure of the justice system to provide services and support for not only her son but also for her family after years of trying. This, for me, was unfortunately a perfect example of what I hear time and time again—that the services aren't there and that we haven't backed up the apology with a commitment to the sorts of services that we need. Why is it that far too many First Nations young people are ending up in care and ending up interacting with the justice system?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a bit of a list from my home state of Western Australia that talks about just some of the issues that First Nations mothers have raised in conversation when we're trying to look at how to move forward. They point out the fact that Western Australia performs incredibly poorly when it comes to appropriate First Nations child protection services and that other jurisdictions are ahead of us, particularly those overseas. The current structure does not support families trying to support their loved ones and it does not support reunification of families. This was actually backed up a number of years ago by the Senate inquiry into out-of-home care, where it was clearly pointed out that the reunification of families is not funded or given proper attention. The department does not respond adequately when concerns are raised about the sexualised behaviour of children in care. They pointed out that it's time for a change to legislation so that there is a more therapeutic and restorative justice approach. Adequate funding is not available in Western Australia, including for the Family Matters campaign, and advocacy is therefore hampered by not having a clear community voice that politicians can listen to. Family and domestic violence services are not adequately funded. This is a national issue, not just a Western Australian issue. Competitive tendering creates distrust and undermines collaboration. The strong families project, which was a positive project, has been abolished. They pointed out that there are no Aboriginal community services and women's peaks. The involvement of Aboriginal people in policymaking must include lived experience. With a high percentage of children in care also having a parent or grandparent from the stolen generations, this is not given adequate attention. There need to be amendments to the Children and Community Services Act, and we need a human rights approach, human rights framing and co-design with First Nations communities. The issues around the therapeutic court need to be extended and resourced properly and trialled more in regional areas. There needs to be support for children with complex needs and their parents when they're interacting in that situation, and we need to ensure we're supporting kinship care and family care properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also talked about the issues caused by intergenerational trauma, the issues around the need for provision of more services and the recognition of intergenerational trauma. They talked about the need for a justice system that meets the needs of First Nations peoples. These are the sorts of things that we still need to address, and we're talking about the anniversary of the apology, which happened 13 years ago. Surely I shouldn't have to stand in this place and raise these issues again. First Nations peoples should not have to continue to raise these issues. It's absolutely essential that these issues are addressed. The issues that I've just articulated are issues in my home state of Western Australia, but they occur all over this country. This system is still discriminatory. It is a racist system and we need to call it out for what it is: discriminatory and racist. Our services are still discriminatory. They do not meet the needs of Aboriginal people. So, next year, when we're standing in this chamber talking about the anniversary of the apology, let's be able to be more positive that these issues are starting to be addressed, because, if not, in 10 years time we'll be here again saying the same things. I don't want to see my replacement standing in this chamber having to say the same things in 10 years time.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I'd like to make a small contribution in this debate as well, because this is a very significant day, recording the 13th anniversary of the apology to the stolen generation. Unlike Senator Dodson, Senator Wong and a number of others, I wasn't in the parliament on the day of the apology being delivered, but I certainly was watching at home, like millions of other Australians. You didn't need to be here to recognise the importance of the apology, the importance of that day, watching the reaction of First Nations people to finally having the truth of the injustice perpetrated upon them recognised by a prime minister of this country. And, as other speakers have said, it was a day of healing for our country. It was an important day, and it was really the start of more work that remains ongoing to reach true justice for our First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also the day that the Closing the Gap statement was launched by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and that was an important act in its own right, to actually commit the Australian government and all of us to targets to once and for all close the unacceptable gap that Indigenous Australians experience in so many aspects of their lives. I noted from the speech given today by the Labor leader, Mr Albanese, that we talk about 'closing the gap' but that is really a polite way of describing what is really a chasm between the experience of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparing these remarks, I asked my office to get some statistics on the state of that gap, or, more correctly, that chasm, in my own home state of Queensland. Some of the most recent figures are that the unemployment rate for First Nations people in my state of Queensland was 20.2 per cent in 2018-19, three times higher than that of non-Indigenous Queenslanders. In 2018-19, 50.8 per cent of 15- to 64-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Queenslanders were employed, compared with 74.1 per cent of non-Indigenous Queenslanders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There remains a dreadful gap in the life expectancy of our First Peoples compared to the rest of us: nationally, for males it remains 7.8 years and for females 6.8 years. I could go on with statistics about school attendance, about qualifications, about incarceration and, most particularly, as already has been discussed by Senator Dodson and other speakers, about the unacceptable level of the removal of First Nations children into state care that continues to go on to this day. I mean, it's not ironic—I can't really think of the term to describe us delivering speeches today on the stolen generation when we still have First Nations children being removed from their families at several times the rate of other Australians. Undoubtedly, there are many, many instances where the removal of a child is the correct response to a particular situation, but, if we continue to have Indigenous children being removed at several times the rate of non-Indigenous children, we have a problem. There is a deeper problem that needs to be addressed, and it is not just a problem for Indigenous people; it is a problem for all of us. It is a problem that all of us have a responsibility in trying to fix in cooperation with our First Peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that really brought home to me the level of disadvantage that our First Peoples continue to experience was a trip I had to Aurukun in Cape York last year, and it really brought home the stark reality of the conditions in which our First Peoples continue to live, in our country. Like so many of the rest of us, I've read the statistics and I've read the figures on overcrowding in housing in Indigenous communities. But, possibly to my shame, it wasn't until I actually went to Aurukun and met with families—everywhere I went was I hearing about houses with families of up to 30 people, in some cases even 40 people, living in two- and three-bedroom homes, just after we had emerged from the worst of the COVID crisis. So, at the very time when all of us had been out there telling people across the country how important it is to maintain social distancing to preserve our health, at the very same time, we were leaving, and continue to leave, Indigenous families in communities all across our country living in conditions where there is no choice but to have severe overcrowding. It's worth remembering that we are talking about people who are highly vulnerable because of their very poor health condition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, how is it that, at a time when Australia is going through the worst health crisis that we have seen in decades, when we have millions of dollars being spent on advertising campaigns telling people about the importance of social distancing and sanitation—at the very same time—we continue to leave families in communities right across this country in conditions which are Third World and which do expose them to greater risk because of the level of overcrowding?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is despite the fact that we have had commitments from this government to spend millions of dollars to fix Indigenous housing. I can tell you, having been into these communities, that money is not hitting the ground. That housing is not being built and that is, therefore, leaving people in overcrowded conditions that are a danger to their health—let alone all of the other social harms that arise from that level of overcrowding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we still see that level of neglect and inaction from this government, just as we saw it 13 years ago, when members of this government, who are still in this parliament today, wouldn't even be in the chamber when the apology was being given. That same attitude, unfortunately, is still reflected, too often, in the language that we hear from members of this government, including the Prime Minister. It is often said by members of this government that addressing the legitimate concerns of our First Peoples creates division within the community. How many times have we heard that? When ideas are being put up about how we can actually achieve reconciliation: 'No, no, no. We can't do that, because that will divide us. That will create division.' We even saw it this year around Australia Day, when the Prime Minister chose to equalise the experience of First Nations people, who have gone through literally genocide, with others in our country, talking about the First Fleet and the arrival of the First Fleet and it not being a flash day for everyone on the First Fleet either. Of course it wasn't a flash day for everyone on the First Fleet, but to equalise that with the experience of anyone with a culture who has experienced genocide is, I think, more than tasteless. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the ongoing needs and the legitimate desires of our First Peoples, and, unfortunately, we continue to see that attitude displayed in the government's policy responses as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just a matter of the language that is chosen. We see it with the government rejecting the Uluru Statement from the Heart and rejecting calls for a First Nations Voice to this parliament, based on the blatant lie that that amounts to a third chamber of the parliament. It is deeply unfortunate that, 13 years on from an apology to the stolen generations, we continue to see mistruths being perpetrated by members of this government to discount and avoid delivering on the legitimate aspirations of our First Peoples. We all have a responsibility to listen to Senator Dodson, to the other First Nations members of this parliament and to all First Nations people across this country, who have been waiting so long to be properly listened to and to have their aspirations achieved. I know that I for one, and everyone on this side of the chamber, support those aspirations, and that is why we so passionately support enshrining a First Nations Voice in the Australian Constitution.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I also want to start with an acknowledgement of all the Indigenous members and senators in this place, who make a terrific contribution to this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess the thing that comes to my mind is that Australia has been a great country, and during this year we have performed better than most other places on earth. But this has not been a good country for Indigenous people. Of course, the apology was a terrific thing, a great gesture. It took too long to be given but it was part of a rebalancing of our history. You can go back to the sixties and look at what Stanner said about the great Australian silence. I think that there's still a lot of that around today, that there is a certain blindness or deafness about some of the misery, frankly, that exists within this society. It is one of the most important issues for us to be thinking about as a parliament. The issues are complex—if we had all the solutions we would have solved the problem some time ago—but people are required to think about the issues. My sense is that too few Australians know Indigenous people. I think it's a problem of proximity: there's not a lack of care but there is a lack of proximity. That has been my observation. In New South Wales there are around 300,000 Indigenous people. I've tried to travel around the state, out to Brewarrina, Bourke, Kempsey, Nowra. I talk to the people in Redfern quite a lot. The issues are complex, but I think the Closing the Gap refresh this year is a genuine attempt to formulate listening into a policy framework, rather than doing without consultation. That is, let's hope, a significant improvement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a need for us to do more beyond refreshing the Closing the Gap targets. The Closing the Gap targets are terribly important because they speak to this disparity. Over the last year, yes, there has been a pandemic, but there have also been significant protests in the United States: the Black Lives Matter movement. People in Australia have said to me, 'Well, that's an imported movement; that has nothing to do with us here,' but then you look at the data and the comparisons on incarceration and on lifespan. The issues are more acute in Australia than they are in the United States. The Closing the Gap targets—Closing the Gap 2.0, you may want to call it—are heavily focused on these bread-and-butter issues. They are focused on education; they are focused on employment; they are focused on reducing incarceration. I think that is good. There is much hope that this Closing the Gap 2.0 will work. It has to work. It is very important that the government put the resources into it to make sure that it does work, because that is a very important national issue for us to spend our time on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that has been spoken about today—and I think there have been some very good contributions in the House as well as in the Senate—is the question of a voice to parliament. It was in the Uluru statement but it was, of course, a policy idea that was around before the Uluru statement was released in 2017. This is the idea that you would consult Indigenous people on laws and policies which impact them. Indigenous people are the only people in Australia who have a whole slew of laws especially made for them. There is no other group in Australian society that has so many laws on our statute books: native title, land rights, heritage protection, Indigenous corporations—the list goes on and on. So I think the idea that you would have a system of consulting people on their special laws is a very good idea. This is something that we are progressing. This is something on which Senator Dodson and Mr Julian Leeser produced a detailed report in the last parliament, and we are now following the recommendation to deliver a voice through co-design. In the last few weeks, the report from Marcia Langton and Tom Calma was released for consultation. That is an important process of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that Mr Rudd did a very good thing for the country. This is an important thing, first, to maintain. I'm very, very mindful that closing the gap 2.0 must work. It is a serious refashioning of that agenda, and it's very important that the resources and the effort are put into that. Beyond that agenda, I think this voice to parliament is something that we should do. It's a good idea, it's a fair idea, and I am personally committed to it. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I rise today to talk about Minnie Daley, who is on my granddaughter Charlee's side. Charlee is a direct descendant of Minnie Daley. Minnie Daley was born on Sturt Creek station in the Kimberley. If you were to look at the history of Sturt Creek station, you would see it was part of what was described as the 'killing times'. There were massacres there. We've not got to the bottom of that yet, but certainly that was part of Minnie's family experience. At some point in her young life, Minnie Daley was stolen from Sturt Creek station, taken from her family, from her mother, along with her brother, Owen, and her sister, Peggy. Minnie also spent time at the Swan Native and Half Caste Mission, in Middle Swan. She stayed there until she reached the age of 18. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I was speaking with Nola Gregory, one of Charlee's grannies, and Nola told me that Minnie died and is buried in a pauper's grave in Karrakatta. That's absolutely shameful, because what we know is that the records of First Nations people in Western Australia, under native protector Neville, are immaculate. So I'm sure it was written in the record books exactly who Minnie Daley was. Nevertheless, she was buried in a pauper's grave and the family weren't notified. Last year the family took Minnie and gave her a proper burial in their adopted home of Geraldton. But Nola, despite being fourth generation, some 60 years later tells me that that pain is still real. It is real, it's passed on, and it's real pain for Charlee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made the apology, I stood on the lawns outside and I knew that there were women here from Geraldton and Morawa. Nola told me to look out for them and that they were wearing T-shirts. One of the things about Nola Gregory is she's an incredibly clever woman and she writes the most amazing poetry, some of which has been published, and other poems are about to be published. Her poems are always incredibly meaningful. Nola wrote a poem for the apology, and those women wore it on their T-shirts, so it was pretty easy for me to track them down and introduce myself. I asked Nola today if I had permission to read her <span style="font-style:italic;">Stolen Generation</span>, her recognition of Sorry Day, to the parliament, and Nola gave me that permission, so I'm going to do that today. This is a poem that Nola Gregory wrote on 5 February 2008:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I too want to add my remarks to this Closing the Gap debate today on the anniversary of the apology to Australia's stolen generations. It was a real privilege to be part of the Rudd government at the time this apology was made. Today I want to turn to things more practical that very much stand in the way of making progress on that promise we made back in 2008. I really want to turn to some of the practical issues that affect Aboriginal peoples, particularly in remote places in Western Australia, and some of the reasons why we simply will not make progress on the Closing the Gap targets if we continue with the lack of commitment and leadership from a Commonwealth government that doesn't want to fund things like municipal services and remote housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great privilege of visiting remote communities just last week out in the Kimberley. We have a state election coming up. The federal election commission handles enrolments for the state election. It is of great consequence and appalling, to my mind, that the federal division of Durack is the constituency with the lowest enrolment in the country, which in large part comes down to a lack of servicing for remote Indigenous communities, a lack of commitment to the special effort required to ensure that all Australians, in particular First Australians who live in remote places on their own country, are enrolled to vote. For Indigenous Australians in remote communities, English will be not their second language but their fourth or fifth language, with their other languages all being the local Indigenous languages and Kriol, which they first and foremost speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could see in the communities that I visited—and I want to pay special attention to Balgo—what a difference improvements to the quality of housing had made to the lives of many there, yet the problem of overcrowding, deteriorating housing stock or housing that hadn't been upgraded is an extreme and continuing issue. In addition, we also see out at Balgo a need for improved water supplies and water security. They desperately need access to renal services in Balgo. I spoke to one elder who was terrified at the prospect of needing to leave her community and needing to leave the young people there without the cultural leadership that elders like her were handing on to young people. She could see countless examples before her of the elders that had to leave those communities in order to access renal services. They have set out to raise some $2 million so that Purple House will be able to play a role in their community in providing those services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really does set us a challenge that we must meet in the delivery of government services. On an issue as important as housing, this Commonwealth government has stepped away from an ongoing commitment to remote community housing. They have stepped away from funding critical municipal services, including things like water. It is very difficult to see how the government's rhetoric in relation to Closing the Gap can be anything more than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited the community of Mulan. It was delightful to see the terrific work being done there by Indigenous Protected Areas rangers. They've just rediscovered the night parrot and they're really excited about their traditional custodianship of their lands. The Indigenous Ranger Program is a terrific program, which is, indeed, funded by the Commonwealth government. Yet critical to the sustainability of those programs are the people who work in those programs being able to live in a sustainable community that is properly serviced with clean water, adequate housing and adequate community facilities. For example, in the community of Balgo, I saw that the older women were staying, in an aged-care context, in the women's housing facility and that the renal and aged-care facility that had been built and set up for future services was not being used at all. In the communities of Kalumburu and Balgo their requests for men's shed funding from the Commonwealth had been refused and rejected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in making these remarks, I really want to underscore and underline the importance of the participation of First Nations communities in the decisions that affect them. I really want to commend Senator Dodson and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy for the work that they have done in this regard. In particular, I commend Senator Dodson, in his role as the shadow minister at the time, for his ongoing commitment to fighting for direct representation for First Nations communities so that they can have oversight of and participate in the decisions that affect them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are yet to see the next iteration of the government's Indigenous voice to government. I look forward to being updated about that. The government said that the voice is a voice to government; it's not a voice to parliament. The government cannot stop agencies and people that this parliament calls from giving evidence, lest they want to interfere with the independence of that voice. So, on this anniversary, I very much look forward to continuing to work with First Nations communities and ensuring that we continue the fight to have the gap—which is very evident in people's life outcomes in our nation—closed and addressed.</span>

                  <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  I'd just like to make some very brief remarks. It hadn't been my intention to speak on this, but, having listened to the very careful and considered contributions of senators, I thought I would make my own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to point to why I think there's opportunity for hope and why a recent event should be seen through the lens of greater Australian consciousness around Indigenous matters. I point to the outrage in regard to the destruction of the Juukan Gorge—an outrageous event. But as I have reflected, I think it was the outrage of non-Indigenous Australians that really catapulted that gross event into the public consciousness. The outrage that many, many Australians felt—not just Indigenous Australians—about that particular event for me demonstrates actually that things are changing and things are moving in a more positive direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I travel around Western Australia, much of my activity is focused on supporting what I call new Australians and supporting and travelling around rural and regional communities. What strikes me about new Australians or multicultural communities when they go about celebrating their heritage in our country is the fact that they always begin their events with an acknowledgement of country. When I think about what the future of our country looks like, when new Australians or those that have come from multicultural communities of longer standing are incorporating into their own events and their own appreciation of their heritage an appreciation of Indigenous heritage, I think that can only bode well for the future. I would add this: when I travel around to some of the communities that Senator Pratt mentioned—Balgo, for example, or Noonkanbah or Roebourne, where I was this week—while there is disappointment and there is concern, I actually see and I continue to see an energy and a passion for local communities finding local solutions that work for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One in particular that struck me is a night patrol in Halls Creek. It's a very, very successful night patrol, which looks after and cares for young children who might be out on the streets late at night. What strikes me about that, on the positive side of the ledger, is the fact that it's a local solution driven by local people. What does frustrate me is how difficult it is to find even a modest amount of public money to support a local initiative like that. I think this is where the frustration and the concern come from for many Australians: why is it that sometimes the simplest things, which local people have identified as fixing their local issues, are the things that are the hardest to get attention to and the hardest to get some public funding for?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that in the Australian community there's a great sense of disappointment that we have not progressed further towards improving Indigenous disadvantage, but I'm someone who believes that if there's more granularity empowering local communities to take responsibility for finding local solutions and that if we put more responsibility on local and state governments, we'll get better local outcomes. I'm someone who believes that rather than restricting ideas to just two or three we should actually be more accustomed, better comfortable, with the idea of identifying a broader suite of things that together can work to correct and to reverse some of the outrageous disadvantage that we see in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm someone that sees clearly the disadvantaged and I'm someone who wants to see more and better action and outcomes. But I'm also someone who encourages others to just look around; I think they will find positive signs of an improving consciousness in Australians and particularly non-Indigenous Australians of their desire and their concern to want to see better outcomes. I thought I'd just make those observations.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  This Saturday marked 13 years since Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologised to Australia's stolen generations. First Nations people waited a long time for that apology, an event which recognised the hurt and pain inflicted on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as a result of government policies and practices which removed children from their families, their country and their culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This chamber ought to be painfully familiar with the numbers which describe Indigenous disadvantage. As my colleague Senator Dodson pointed out in his remarks earlier, the shocking truth is that, as horrifying and unjust as these numbers are, the indicators are worse again for stolen generations and their children, their grandchildren and their siblings. A 2019 report from the Healing Foundation sets this out. When compared to other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, stolen generations are 50 per cent more likely to be charged by police, 15 per cent more likely to consume alcohol at risky levels and 30 per cent less likely to report being in good health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the trauma of forced removal and family break-up has enduring consequences for First Nations families, and they are wideranging. They are impacting men, women and children. The mechanisms by which this trauma is transmitted may be complex, but the indicators are straightforward. Three in five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a male intimate partner, and First Nations women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised due to a family violence assault and 10 times more likely to die from a violent assault than other women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I spent a couple of days in Bundjalung country in the Northern Rivers, talking with workers who support First Nations families. I spoke to workers in legal centres, in refuges, in housing organisations and in family service organisations. I thank the workers at Bugal Nah, Bunjum, Jarjum preschool, the Northern Rivers Women's Domestic Violence and Court Advocacy Service, Rekindling The Spirit and Jali, because all of them took time with me to explain their perspective on what it meant for them as First Nations people to work in their community to drive solutions to the problems that they perceive and to leverage their knowledge of country, culture and family to bring local solutions to local problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These people were inspiring and also moving. Some of the stories were very hard to hear. But these people are moving forward, doing everything they can in their communities to lead in their communities and to take on difficult issues. But their optimism—and they are optimists—was tempered by a kind of despair too, because the resources available to these people in these communities blighted by missions, racism, removal and cruelty are so limited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's Safety New South Wales found that frontline Aboriginal domestic and family violence specialist services had reported a significant increase in client numbers since the beginning of COVID-19, including an increase in the complexity of cases before them. Workers in the Northern Rivers told me that what they urgently need is long-term affordable accommodation. But none of the government's safe places grants went to the Northern Rivers, despite there being many applicants, and the actual story is that this is forcing women to either stay living with perpetrators or face down homelessness for themselves and their children. These workers are saying so clearly that they want to lead. They want to lead in their own communities to heal families, to heal communities and to respond to violence, and they want to be given the power and the resources from government to develop their own solutions. They want to do it their way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first acts of the Morrison government after the 2019 election, after being re-elected, was to cut the funding for the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Forum. It is the only peak body specifically tasked with representing services working to prevent and respond to domestic and family violence against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It plays an essential role in ensuring that the voices and views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children are heard in our national conversation, and the Morrison government should give this forum the sustainable funding that it needs to continue this important work. We cannot continue to ignore the compounding effect that racism and gender inequality have in exacerbating levels of violence, and ending violence against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women must be a national priority. Every single Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander woman, man and child deserves to live a life free from violence and fear and to thrive, secure in their culture and identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a role in play in closing the gap. What that really means is listening to, supporting and empowering First Nations communities. For services, that means empowering First Nations to lead in the design and the delivery of the services in their own communities. This will require us to do things differently and to understand that power might need to be devolved to others and that decisions might be taken elsewhere. It also means listening to First Nations people when they give us some very specific guidance—a very specific invitation about how they want to enact this vision for their own leadership. The Uluru Statement from the Heart represents one of the most important such invitations in a very long time. Labor is committed to implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. We are committed to a constitutionally enshrined voice and a makarrata commission to oversee agreement, treaty making and a national process of truth telling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people have told us of the torment of their powerlessness. It is time for us to truly respond. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                  </a>  Labor will not be supporting this motion, for a couple of reasons. One of them is that we think motions like this, where there are a range of opinions in this chamber, should be allowed to be brought in as part of the program that allows for substantive debate. The Greens do this week in, week out. They bring forward motions where they seek a yes or no answer on a matter which is worthy of substantive debate. They live in their own little perfect world, but in the real world, where the rest of us operate, there is a legitimate reason for substantive debate on these matters to be allowed. They do this every time. I look forward to the Greens political party bringing forward a motion where they work with other members in this place to hold these environmental vandals to account, instead of trying to move wedge motions on us.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation will be supporting this motion. It is true that the JobSeeker COVID supplement was set so high that it provided a disincentive to work. Once the rate reverts next month, JobSeeker will be too low for the unemployed to live on. This will make finding a job harder, not easier—$282 a week is not work incentive; it's punishment. If increasing JobSeeker temporarily to the ridiculous amount of $550 a week was good economic policy to assist the recovery, a much smaller permanent increase must also be good policy. The Morrison government's opposition to an increase in JobSeeker and pensions makes no sense. It's an embarrassment to conservatives, and I urge the government to reconsider. While this motion does not put a figure on the desired increase, One Nation supports a $75 a week increase in JobSeeker and pensions effective immediately.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few weeks and months, everything about the global fight on the climate emergency has changed: 2030 targets, net zero commitments, coal and gas exports and now carbon tariffs. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that he wants to use June's G7 meeting to forge an alliance on carbon border adjustment mechanisms. While this government is trying to secure a free trade agreement with the European Union, the EU ambassador has urged us to embrace 'more ambitious and emboldened' climate policies. Japan, a country that accepts 40 per cent of Australia's LNG exports and over a third of our thermal coal exports, is set to make a decision by July on its own carbon border adjustment mechanism. In the platform that he took to the 2020 election, US President Biden said that his administration will 'impose carbon adjustment fees or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations' and 'will also condition future trade agreements on partners' commitments to meet their enhanced Paris climate targets'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know that this government has turned Australia into a global pariah when it comes to climate action and that we face the scorn of the international community when it comes to doing our fair share to reduce emissions. Prime Minister Morrison was refused an invitation to the UN Climate Ambition Summit late last year. The former Prime Minister of Tuvalu has said that the Prime Minister's actions at the 2019 Pacific Islands Forum communicated the view that Pacific leaders should 'take the money then shut up about climate change'. This government has spent the last two meetings of the Paris Agreement begging the rest of the world to let Australia cheat on our emissions accounting by using Kyoto-era carryover credits, something that no other country is intending to use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now it looks like Australia's exporters will have to wear the consequences of this government's go-slow approach as well. We don't know how far the consequences could go. Maybe there'll be tariffs based on the carbon intensity of our goods, and all of the exporters who rely on our dirty coal based electricity, which this government refuses to transition off, will get whacked with a big fee. Maybe the tariffs will be general and impact all exporters, which could see even low-carbon exporters hit with tariffs due to this government's inaction. We don't know yet and, given the nature of these global trade agreements, there is every chance that we won't have much of a say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's so sad about this is that it doesn't need to be this way. We had a price on carbon, and it worked. We brought down energy emissions by 12 million tonnes in just the two years before it was repealed, the only time prior to COVID that that's happened in this country. We are blessed with the resources of the sun and the wind. We have the engineering and technical know-how to rapidly transform our economy. But politics—the politics of the big parties and the big coal and gas corporations who pay for their campaigns—continues to get in the way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have two options available to us: we can continue to double-down on our fossil fuel obsession while the rest of the world leaves Australia behind, or we can do our fair share to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adopt science based 2030 targets and make a proper plan to meet them. There are no other options.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You hear from the government that somehow we can close our eyes and wish it all away. Minister Taylor has said that he's dead against carbon tariffs. I'm sorry, minister, but that's not how it works. You can be dead against them all you like, but, if we want to be part of the global community, we can't just unilaterally decide to shirk our responsibility on emissions. That's the choice—a job-rich transformation to a low-carbon economy or a poorer, hotter, more dangerous and more insular Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government faces a series of very serious threats over the coming months: President Biden's April climate summit, the G7 meeting in June, the 2021 Pacific Islands Forum and, finally, COP26 in Glasgow in November. And, while talk of 'preferably by 2050' might be a balm for those who want to delay action, it is what we do and say over the next decade that counts. It is science based 2030 targets and the next decade that will be debated at the Biden summit, at the G7 and at COP26. The decisions that this government makes over the coming months will set the course for not only the future of the fight on climate change but the future of Australia's role in the world. The eyes of the world are on us, and, if this government fails again, there will be consequences.</span>

                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  I think it's great that the Greens have moved this motion this evening in the Senate, because it once again highlights the difficulty that the Greens political party seem to have in conceiving the concept of democracy. It's, I thought, a pretty simple system we have here—a tough system, but a simple one—where we have these things called elections in our country every three years for the federal parliament. There are certain policies put forward by different political parties at those elections. The Australian people choose which of those parties or groups they'd like to rule them, and those policies then are generally, hopefully, implemented and promises are kept, hopefully, and passed through this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, the Greens don't like what the Australian people have said over the past decade, so now they're hoping, wishing, praying and trying to get through this place that we encourage other nations to rule us. We encourage other countries to tell us what we should do here in this country and how we should govern ourselves! The Greens would effectively disenfranchise the Australian people and say, 'Your views are simple, your views are not sophisticated enough and your views don't accord with a globalist agenda that other countries have adopted, so they should be imposed on you regardless of what you vote for or who you support.' That is the position of this motion. The position of this motion says that we should—and Senator Waters just outlined it there—adopt carbon taxes and carbon prices very soon so we can avoid other countries trying to force us to do something through carbon adjustment border mechanisms, or otherwise just put tariffs and taxes on us. So, because the Greens haven't been able to convince the Australian people to impose a tax on themselves, they are wishing and hoping other countries impose a tax on this country. How un-Australian can you get! Whatever your views are on what we should do on climate change, how could you credibly sit there and be wishing and praying other countries tax Australia? That is what this motion calls for. Anyone who supports it—the Labor Party supports it—are supporting other countries taxing this country, taxing our jobs, taking away our income and making us poorer as a nation because of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just go through the record here. Let's just spell out the track record of the last decade in terms of putting forward policies of this nature, putting forward carbon taxes and carbon prices or whatever you want to call them—there have been lots of names, which I'll go through. Let's go through and see what the Australian people decided, because this did start about a decade ago when then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd adopted the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the CPRS. At the time, he did have it for a while. Then it became a bit tough for him—it was the 'greatest moral challenge of our time' then wasn't. But we went to the election in 2010, and the Labor Party effectively lost—it was a draw really—and then they had to get the support of some country Independents to govern. The Australian people weren't happy with the CPRS. Rudd had sort of got it rid of it before, and Ms Gillard then stood at that election saying, 'There'll be no carbon tax from the government I lead.' The Australian people voted for parties. Neither party had a carbon tax in their policy. In fact, the then leader of the political party, who became the Prime Minister, explicitly said she would not impose a carbon tax. Anyway, that promise was broken. The Labor government at the time went against the will of the Australian people. They imposed that tax, which played a big part in the fact that they got smashed in the 2013 election. They lost on a policy of a carbon tax—another loss for a carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 Mr Mark Butler—long may he rest now he's no longer the shadow climate minister—took forward an emissions intensity scheme to the election. It was another loss for the Labor Party. It was defeated at the 2016 election. The Australian people rejected that too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then a couple of years ago, in 2019, Mr Bill Shorten took forward a policy of a 45 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. It was a bit unclear whether it would be through a carbon price or a carbon tax, but it was a significantly larger emissions reduction than the coalition policy had committed to in Paris, and again—again—it was rejected by the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're zero from four for a carbon tax or a carbon price over the last decade, yet still we hear the Greens—and, I don't know, maybe Labor here this afternoon—wishing, hoping and praying that a carbon tax will be imposed on the Australian people by hook or by crook, by whatever means they deem necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of cheering on other countries imposing taxes on our own jobs, our own income, our own wealth, our own people, we should be standing up for what we're doing right in this country. The hypocrisy of other nations that would seek to do these things! I think the chances of these border adjustments are very remote, for the very simple reason that if other countries adopt them they'll have to apply them to themselves. To be in any way consistent they'll have to apply them to themselves. In Europe, where a lot of these calls are coming from, 21 of the 27 countries are not on track to meet their Paris commitments. So what are they going to do? Are they going to reintroduce tariffs within Europe? Are they going to get rid of the EU? They're applying this policy, and it's being applied to members who are not meeting their climate change goals; well, there should be a reimposition of tariffs among European countries for those countries that are laggards, that are not meeting their targets. In fact just last week a French court ruled that the French government are not meeting their Paris commitments right now. Are they going to apply these taxes to themselves? I don't think they will. These seem like empty threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You then go back to the Kyoto agreement, which came due last year. The Kyoto agreement commitments were made in 1997, I believe. I might be getting that date wrong. It was sometime in the late 1990s that the Kyoto agreement was finalised. Countries made various commitments to cut their emissions by 2020. A lot of countries didn't meet the target. We did. Australia met our commitments and our targets, but Canada didn't meet their targets and New Zealand didn't meet their targets. Are they going to impose carbon adjustment border mechanisms on themselves? How are they going to tax their own products? I don't know how they're going to impose tariffs on their own products—an internal tariff would be an interesting thing to impose—but that would be the rationale under this scheme. We should be fighting against this hypocrisy and pointing out that that kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated at all, at any international level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we believe in an international rules based trading system and in free trade—which has come under a lot of pressure in the last 20 years for reasons well outside this debate—and want to continue to support it, where does all this go? What happens when a country turns around and says, 'If you keep culling your kangaroo herd we're going to impose a carbon adjustment border mechanism on you'? How much more national sovereignty will be impinged based on countries threatening or imposing tariffs on other nations? It is at the heart of the Westphalian system that countries should not be able to dictate the policies of another nation. For that reason I cannot see this particular proposal getting past first base. It hasn't yet. There has been a lot of talk and there have been a lot of threats, a lot of smoke and mirrors, but really it would completely destroy the system of nation-state governance and cordial relations between ourselves if it were to come into place, because it would go well beyond climate change if it were to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to focus a little bit on the inherent absurdity of a lot of these proposals to save the planet through global action right now, in the current environment. I imagine that if these mechanisms were to come into place—if carbon tariffs were to be put in place—they wouldn't apply just to Australia; they would have to be applied to other countries too. I wonder how they're going to be enforced and checked. I wonder how other nations will determine whether a particular country is breaching its commitments and therefore deserves to have a carbon tariff imposed on it. I say that particularly in the context of what we've seen in the past week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past week we've seen the international observers from the World Health Organization who travelled to China—and they spent months in China trying to uncover the origins of the coronavirus—come back empty handed. Indeed, it has been revealed this week that there are hundreds of blood samples that China is not sharing with these inspectors. They have not been able to come to any really worthwhile conclusions about the origins of the coronavirus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to those in this chamber who are taking the threat of carbon tariffs seriously, apparently in the future climate inspectors from, say, the IPCC—unlike those health inspectors who failed—will have no problems enforcing and disciplining countries like China and finding out whether they really are meeting their net zero targets. Does anyone believe this absurdity? Does anyone believe that China is going to allow climate inspectors into its country to determine how many coal-fired power stations it has and how much emissions it is producing? No way. Hell would freeze over before that would happen.</span>

                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  It's always a pleasure to speak on these motions that are drafted by the Greens. Sometimes I wonder whether Senator Canavan drafts them himself and sends them to the Greens so that he can have an opportunity to speak about his favourite subject, which is all the things the Greens are doing wrong—not what the government is doing right. While I don't agree with every aspect of this urgency motion there are parts that I agree with and that we need to discuss in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree that policies should be science based, and that is a real problem for this government. We've been recently dealing with the pandemic and we've had alternative facts from members of this government—alternative facts about cures, processes, the coronavirus itself and vaccines. This government has been unable to deal with members of its caucus who can't accept science, who rally against science and who see science as something that should be debated. The Deputy Prime Minister said in an interview that sometimes facts are up for debate. But science shouldn't be up for debate when it is so crucial and so important for public health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there are members of the government who rally against the science of climate change. They rally against the science that is about protecting public health. Climate change is a risk to public health. This government has members sitting on the benches over there. I have sat in committees where scientists have been attacked, derailed and questioned about the science that they are presenting. It is extraordinary to witness that sort of behaviour from a government that should be applying the best possible science to its policy making. We know that that doesn't happen, and that's why this government has really struggled to make any headway when it comes to climate action and when it comes to dealing with carbon emissions. It's why there is a real risk of not getting our health response to this pandemic correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree with the part of this motion that says that this is an urgent matter. It's urgent because there's not enough certainty for businesses and workers. There's not enough urgency about a plan for targets, carbon emissions and our energy market. Businesses are looking to the government for guidance. They want to make decisions about the future. These businesses aren't making 12-month plans; they are making 10-year plans and they need to know from this government what parameters they will be working with. But, unfortunately, we know what happens with the LNP is someone comes up with an idea, then the Nationals come over to the joint party room and say, 'That's not going to happen. We don't want to do that,' and everyone gives up and walks away. I do agree with the inference in this motion that it would be much better for workers, for jobs, for our trading exporters if members of this government, particularly the Nationals, were kept as far away from energy and manufacturing policy as possible, because all they have managed to do is hold back our regions and industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that parts of regional Queensland—the parts of our country that members opposite talk about all the time in terms of protecting jobs and standing up for the regions—are parts of our country that could have a jobs boom when it comes to renewable energy and getting our energy mix right. We have in Far North Queensland a real problem when it comes to jobs right now. I have spent a lot of time in this chamber arguing that this government should step in and support tourism operators. They are not doing what they should be doing when it comes to supporting tourism operators. But what the government also haven't done is, over the last seven years, given a town like Cairns a plan to diversify its economy. They haven't been able to say where other jobs might be able to come from. We know there might be another pilot strike, might be another COVID-19, but, for seven years, there has been no diversification of jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to renewable energy, we can create jobs in Far North Queensland. We have wind, we have solar and we can create thousands and thousands of jobs if we get the settings right. We've got a fantastic wind farm in Far North Queensland called the Mount Emerald Wind Farm. I visited it recently. It's got 53 wind turbines. Every single one of those wind turbines was manufactured overseas. I look at this huge construction and the workers that take so much pride in maintaining that facility, but it’s a missed opportunity that we haven't been able to manufacture those wind turbines right here in Australia. So we are talking about targets, talking about plans, talking about the federal government walking away from net zero emissions in 2050. On this side of the chamber, we're talking about the jobs that are going missing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the businesses that don't have certainty. It's the businesses that are crying out for cheaper energy prices so we can manufacture things like wind turbines, so we can build trains in regional Queensland, so we can build and maintain ships in regional Queensland, but they can't do it if they don't know what the energy setting policies will be over the next five, 10, 15 years. We ask these business, these fantastic family and local businesses, to make long-term investments in our regions. But without knowing what the policy settings will be, they are unable to do that, and the Morrison government has repeatedly refused to commit to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, declaring that the government's plan is to achieve net zero emissions in the second half of the century. You really have to wonder why they are unable to commit to this target alone. The Deputy Prime Minister and members of the National Party have made it clear that the reason that they don't want to commit to a 2050 target is that they won't be in parliament in 2050. It's that sort of short-sightedness that really irks members of the public in regional Queensland. It is that sort of short-sightedness that has led to a situation where we don't have diversification of our economy in regional Queensland. Jobs in renewables could boom by 44,000 jobs by 2025 but only with the right policy. With the right policy support, renewable energy could employ as many as 40,000 Australian workers, almost doubling the 25,000 workers in the sector right now. But that is only with the right policy settings, only with a commitment from this government and only with the establishment of a robust and secure workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Far North Queensland we know that when it comes to science, saving jobs and taking action on climate change there is no better example of what's at risk than the Great Barrier Reef. Right now we are trying to support business operators whose hearts are breaking at the moment. In the last week or so I've spoken to tourism operators who are really struggling. They are really struggling because this government has shown a complete lack of concern about their businesses. Grown men are crying. Their hearts are breaking because they know that their businesses are at real risk if this government isn't able to support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The risk going forward through the pandemic is that, if we don't get our climate action settings right, the impacts on the Great Barrier Reef will be irreversible. Without flights with international visitors coming into Cairns right now, our tourism businesses are struggling, but if there's no reef to visit then those planes will stop forever. We need to back-in these businesses and local jobs. The only way to do that is by giving some certainty around targets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to talk about energy security and energy affordability. The European Union has threatened to impose a tariff on our exports to punish Australians for not having destroyed as much of our economy as the Europeans have destroyed of theirs with ruinous renewable energy. At the same time as the EU is in the grip of record cold, solar panels over there are covered in snow and windmills are frozen solid. Germany, the home of the Greens, has just opened a new HELE coal plant, Datteln 4, which has 1,100 megawatts of reliable base-load coal power. It is proving the difference between keeping the lights on and sitting in the cold and dark. Heating and cooling are not optional to the elderly and the infirm. Energy security and energy affordability are essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The welfare of Australians must be our foremost consideration in energy policy, yet in Australia the Greens insist on pursuing a strategy that will create a hostile energy environment. The old parties—the Liberals, Labor and the Nationals—have joined in. In Western Australia the Liberal and National parties have announced a plan to close their coal power plants by 2025, in four years time. The New South Wales Liberals and Nationals are closing the Liddell coal power plant in 2023. What's ALP policy? They want to shut down half of our coal-fired power by 2030. At least, I think that's right. The ALP policy changes depending on who's telling the story and where they're telling the story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every major party has the same policy: to close our base-load power plants without first building replacements. One Nation is the only party with an energy plan that will provide for Australia's energy security now and in the future. We will build a 2,000-megawatt hydroplant near Townsville and microhydro across the grid. One Nation will build high-efficiency, low-emissions—HELE—coal plants in the Hunter and at Collinsville in Queensland. One Nation's plan will bring back manufacturing and jobs and deliver employment security and higher wages—in short, a better standard of living for all Australians. I'll say it again: One Nation is the only party of energy security and energy affordability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention a phrase used in the Greens motion: science based 2030 energy policy. In December 2016, Senator Ian Macdonald said, 'The science has never been debated in this parliament—never—until Senator Roberts raised it.' I can still say it's never been debated, because no-one will debate it. It's been 515 days now since I first challenged in the Senate Senator Waters, the current Greens leader, and Senator Di Natale, the leader at the time, to a debate on the empirical scientific evidence of their claim and on the corruption of climate science. Not once have they provided that evidence. Not once have they accepted a debate. It's over 10 years now, nearly 10½ years, since I first challenged Senator Waters, at a debate at the powerhouse in New Farm on Thursday 7 October 2010. Senator Canavan talks about Nationals policy. They went to the last election with a policy for coal, and every policy since has said nothing about coal. One Nation is the only party of energy security and energy affordability.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  Another day, another motion of urgency from the Greens where it's all about ruining Australian business and ruining jobs and all about virtue signalling. It's clear to all senators, I believe, and to all Australians that the Greens are not a party of action. They are not a party of government. They are a party of protest and a party that relies solely on selling fear, knowing that they will never ever have to come up with a plan that works—and this motion today shows exactly that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is not about the Greens providing suggestions on how the Morrison government can achieve zero emissions; they are solely suggesting that the Morrison government makes virtue-signalling announcements. This government that I'm a part of is focused on results, not on hollow promises. All this motion today does is encourage foreign countries to impose tariffs and taxes on Australian businesses, with the likely effect of destroying Australian jobs, Australian industries and Australian families. The actions of the Greens today, in providing cover and support for foreign countries to apply tariffs on Australian products, are despicable. The Greens should be ashamed of themselves, because what do the Greens get out of putting forward a motion such as this? Maybe it's a headline, a social media post, a tweet, and providing cover for foreign countries to tax Australian businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is really disappointing about this motion is that the Greens know full well that the Australian government is taking real action to reduce our emissions. We've set targets, we've smashed Kyoto and we are on our way to meeting and beating our Paris obligations. What we know for certain is that it's outcomes that matter—actions and outcomes. The Morrison government is taking real, practical and pragmatic action and delivering real outcomes. As a result of the actions we are taking, we are delivering lower emissions while protecting our economy, jobs and investment. We have strong targets, an enviable track record and a clear plan. Our plan is driven by technology and not taxes; and, most importantly, our plan is working. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While ambition is important, achievement and outcomes are what matter. So let's talk about our achievements. As I said before, we've smashed our Kyoto targets by 450 million tonnes. Australia's emissions have fallen faster than the G20 average, faster than the OECD average and much, much faster than in similar developed economies, like Canada and New Zealand. Between 2005 and 2018, our emissions fell by more than 13 per cent. New Zealand's emission reductions, on the other hand, barely budged. Canada's fell by less than one per cent. Emissions actually increased across the G20 countries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest figures have us at nearly 17 per cent below 2005 levels, which shows we are on track to meet and beat our 2030 target, which is currently to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels. Furthermore, on a per person basis, our 2030 target is more ambitious than that of Norway, Canada, Germany, New Zealand or France. Let's not forget that this is not a ceiling on our ambitions; it's a floor. We will go beyond these. As we did with the Kyoto targets, the Morrison government want to not only meet our 2030 targets but also beat them. The latest emissions projections, published in December 2020, show that we are on track to do exactly that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians should be proud of our achievements. Unlike the plans of those opposite, we have achieved this without increasing taxes. We are committed to the principle of technology-driven emissions reduction, not taxes. As the Prime Minister has said, we want to get to net zero emissions as soon as possible. However, we will not sacrifice jobs and industries across Australia, particularly in our regional areas, for virtually no global emissions benefit. Instead of focusing on virtue signalling, like the Greens are, the Morrison government is focused on how we will do that. We are focused on assisting in the development of the technological breakthroughs that we will need to make net zero emissions a reality. By focusing on technology, not only will Australia reduce its emissions; we will also help reduce emissions right across the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have repeatedly said in this place, actions and outcomes are what matter. Our track record is one that all Australians can be proud of, so I will repeat it: we beat our 2020 target by 459 million tonnes. Recently updated forecasts show Australia is on track to meet and beat its 2030 Paris target. Over the last two years our position against our 2030 target has improved by 639 million tonnes. This is the equivalent of taking all of Australia's 14.7 million cars off the road for 15 years. Between 2005 and 2018, our emissions fell faster than those of Canada, New Zealand, Japan and the US, and they fell against the OECD average. Emissions in the National Electricity Market have fallen to their lowest level since records began. In the last 12 months our emissions were down by five per cent, with record levels of investment in renewables continuing. In 2020, a record seven gigawatts of new renewable capacity was installed in Australia. That's more renewables injected into the Australian market in a single year under the Morrison Liberal government than were injected under the whole previous Labor government. Compared to the rest of the world, Australia now has the highest total amount of solar PV capacity per person installed. We have the most wind and solar per person of any country outside of Europe. Today, Australia's emissions are lower than in any year under the previous Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the great success that the Morrison government has already had in this space, we have the Greens coming into this place and encouraging foreign countries to tax Australian businesses. This is a new low, even by the abysmal standards of the Greens. While the Morrison government has seen great achievements in this space, we are not resting on our laurels. We have a clear plan to keep this momentum going. To do this, we have developed Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap. Our commitment is clear: lower prices and keeping the lights on, all while doing our bit to reduce global emissions without wrecking the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Advancing the next generation of low-emission technologies is crucial to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. 'Why?' you might ask. It is because the technologies to get us to net zero don't currently exist. Our Technology Investment Roadmap will accelerate technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, soil carbon measurement, low-carbon materials like steel and aluminium, and long-duration energy storage. Widespread global deployment of those technologies will reduce emissions, or eliminate them, in sectors responsible for 90 per cent of the world's emissions. This is approximately 45 billion tonnes. It's about setting practical goals for the technologies that offer the most abatement potential for the least cost. That is where Australia has a real advantage. That is real ambition. It focuses on the big picture and on the long game, rather than on the political pointscoring and on the news headline capturing that we see time and time again from the Greens.</span>

In doing so, I have a revelation to make to those opposite. It might shock them. Some may be horrified and they'll rush away to check their diaries. It's not a revelation to the rest of us. We know the date. We know what year it is. But I feel I need to inform those opposite that it is 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One more year has slipped away—one more year of the Morrison government's inaction on climate change and carbon emissions. One more year; one more lost opportunity. It's one more year in a run of many years through three Liberal Party prime ministers—yes, three—that have done nothing to curb our country's emissions, one more year of coalition infighting, one more year of denialism and one more year of failure when it comes to meeting our international obligations and when it comes to the future of our planet and our way of life. It's a failing in our moral obligations as global citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The European Union plans to introduce a carbon border tax which would require Australian exporters to pay a levy based on the amount of carbon used in making and shipping their products. The levy on exporters would equal the cost European producers face through having to buy carbon emission permits via the EU's emissions trading system. The world has moved on without us, and, sadly, we are left behind. We are no longer at the table and we are no longer even invited to the meetings, and now the Morrison government's smug denialism, parochial dog whistling, short-term political manoeuvres, win-at-all-costs mentality and, most of all, absolute lack of vision and leadership have doubled back to bite us and to potentially savage our exporters. Suddenly the cold, hard truth, the cost of doing nothing, has reared up in the Morrison government's face, and suddenly the cost of doing nothing in 2021 is very, very real. The European parliament's decision gives initial backing to the EU's carbon border levy, and Brussels is now working towards US President Joe Biden's emission-busting goal of a global climate club. That's a club that we won't be able to join—not under the Morrison government, anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">European politicians and analysis expect the US, Britain and potentially even China to get behind the plan to jointly adopt carbon border taxes, and our exporters are now at serious risk because the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, and his science-denying cronies are frozen to the spot and living in the last century. On top of that, the EU is also insisting on stronger climate targets as a condition of the free trade agreement that it is negotiating with Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the trade minister, Mr Dan Tehan, to publicly explain how the Morrison government's climate inaction will affect the proposed free trade agreement with the European Union. He needs to come and tell us how it is going to affect the proposed free trade agreement with the European Union. I call on him to explain the cost of doing nothing to the farmers, the foresters, the fishers, the miners, the manufacturers, the innovators and the investors of Australia. Let them hold him to account, particularly when we know that many of Australia's largest exporters support the net zero target. They understand Australia can become a clean-energy superpower, leading to stronger economic growth and more jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 120 countries worldwide have adopted a net zero emissions target and more than 70 per cent of Australia's two-way trade is now with countries moving to net zero by the middle of the century—yes, this century, just 29 years away. And yet, with all this hanging over our heads, Mr Morrison has said, 'I am not concerned about our future exports.' Well, I am, Mr Morrison, and so is the Australian Labor Party and a lot of Australians. Just a few days ago the Nationals leader, Mr Michael McCormack, said that he was not worried about what might happen in 30 years time. It's 29 years now, Mr McCormack. He clearly doesn't know that it's now 2021. Absurdly, the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, decided that Australia was 'dead against' carbon tariffs and was somehow trying to twist the EU proposal as protectionism when, as noted by Laura Tingle on <span style="font-style:italic;">ABC News</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… in fact these tariffs would aim to level the playing field for local industries against free-rider countries like Australia who won't engage in real climate policy action …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is in a state of climate and energy policy chaos, which we can now clearly see will lead to dwindling opportunities for our exporters. Those exporters are rightly and extremely worried about future exports. Of course they are. Their jobs rely on thinking ahead, and they've been doing it for many years. I'd also mention the many, many workers that they employ in this country. They completely understand that this is the year 2021 and it is past time for genuine leadership and action from this Australian government, the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Net zero emissions by 2050 is a target backed by every state and territory in Australia, key business groups, the National Farmers Federation, big resource companies, our biggest airline, our biggest bank and countless experts and scientists. Mr Tehan must now explain how the government's failure to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050 will affect Australian exports and jeopardise Australia's free trade agreement negotiations with the EU. Maybe now—now that there is a tangible financial cost to doing nothing, now that the cost of inertia and irresponsibility will hit the government's hip pocket and the hip pockets of some of the big businesses who support them—Prime Minister Morrison will call the climate-denying rabble in his government to order and show some leadership. It's about time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs to adopt a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but we need to start that process now. We need it legislated. In 2021, that is blindingly obvious. We have known about this for a very long time. It is also blindingly obvious that the Morrison government has its head in the sand about carbon borders and our exporters with the jobs that they create, because they are the ones that will pay the price. It is the exporters that provide the thousands of jobs around this country that will pay the price for the inaction of this government in relation to climate change. This government, caught in a loop of smug inertia, should pay the ultimate price at the ballot box at the next election for their inaction on reducing Australia's carbon emissions and the effects of that inaction on the Australian community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  It might surprise you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that over Christmas I read Malcolm Turnbull's memoirs. He very clearly labelled Senator Canavan as one of the 'terrorists', as he calls them, within his own party—the culture warriors who did so much to derail climate action in this country and blow up any agenda for climate action in the last five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the contribution from Senator Canavan tonight, it's very clear that nothing has changed. Interestingly, Malcolm Turnbull also says that the right wing within his own party, the culture warriors, are also socialists. I would have to agree with him based on what I've heard tonight: a Nationals senator rallying against free trade deals. That's what we heard in here. It was a tirade of anti-free-trade, anti-farmer abuse from Senator Canavan. Perhaps, in some senses, his concerns around free trade deals are very much in line with the Greens. So there you go, Senator Canavan—that's something I think we can all agree on!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But clearly he's failed to stop even his own Prime Minister from putting into place a so-called 2050 climate ambition target. But, a day after that was announced, we get Mr Barnaby Joyce in the other place and the Deputy Prime Minister in this country, when asked about the Prime Minister's new-found 2050 ambition—which, by the way, has only come because a new US administration has decided to show some global leadership and he's looking for some kind of face-saving gesture—go: '2050? I'm not going to be here in parliament then. None of us are. In fact, I'll probably be dead.' That's how serious the Nationals are taking this issue. That's how short-sighted they are on this most important of issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at putting out climate targets for another 30 years, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's a complete joke. You'd also be forgiven for not trusting this mob. In the last eight years since they've assumed power in this country, they have literally torn up every existing climate policy that was put in place—a carbon price, a clean energy package—and they've ramped up fossil fuel exploration, especially during COVID, whilst not providing a single credible policy to tackle global warming. And it's worth highlighting that Australia has, within this past decade, gone from being a global leader on climate action to a global embarrassment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been particularly astounding this week to watch Senator Canavan and the other Nats roll out and call for agriculture to be excluded from any 2050 climate ambition. It's particularly galling, because there is no other industry more vulnerable to climate change than agriculture. There is no other industry more vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bureau of Meteorology told us at Senate estimates recently that, even on existing emissions trajectories, a business-as-usual scenario, we're looking at three to four degrees warming globally by the end of this century. Think about that: record heat, drought, extreme weather and fire, which we have seen in recent years, are going to get much, much worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a public rebuke for the LNP by some of their key stakeholders, the National Farmers Federation. They don't want agriculture excluded from the 2050 climate ambition. They believe the farming community in this country has an important contribution to make. And it's not just the National Farmers Federation. The national position of climate is at odds with various agricultural bodies—Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, Farmers for Climate Action. Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, who are potentially facing a carbon tariff, has an industry target to be carbon neutral by not 2050 but 2030. Farmers for Climate Action also support an economy-wide target for 2050. So clearly farmers' groups think this is really important, yet the farmer's friends, the National Party, continue to come into this place and deny climate, deny climate action and turn their back on rural and regional agricultural communities in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of this situation is it's not just Europe in our free trade negotiations that have said that they plan to put in place a carbon tariff. President Biden went to the last election promising this is something the US would look at. And we know there are negotiations between the UK and the EU at G7 meetings to talk about carbon border adjustments, whether we like it or not. Even Japan, our biggest customer of coal and gas, is looking at making a decision in July. Farmers should be benefitting from a carbon price in these countries. If this government hadn't come in here and ripped up the carbon tax, if this government hadn't come in here and ripped up a price on carbon, if this government hadn't come in here and ripped up the Carbon Farming Initiative, where Australian farmers get to sell their carbon abatement credits into export markets, for example, in Europe, they'd be getting $50 a tonne for their carbon abatement credits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, industries in Australia like meat and livestock and other farming and agricultural industries are facing a $50 a tonne tariff. We estimate that since this government ripped up the Carbon Farming Initiative and brought in their Emissions Reduction Fund, which has been almost a complete failure, Australian farmers have lost out to the tune of $12 billion on this lucrative market of carbon trading. This is purely because of the ideology of a few 'terrorists within the Liberal Party', using the words of Malcolm Turnbull, like Senator Canavan and others in this place. They've held this country to ransom and farmers and agriculturalists in rural and regional Australia are paying. And they're paying in so many ways. There have to be incentives for our farmers to be involved in climate action. That is what we're talking about here: bringing all our country with us, bringing the whole nation with us to actually put in place not just 2050 targets but 2030 targets based on science. Unless we have 2030 targets, we will never achieve net zero emissions by 2050. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not trust this mob. They have done everything to avoid even talking about climate change in the last 10 years. Do not trust them on their track record. Without the Greens in parliament to hold them to account, we will get nothing. There needs to be a political pathway for change. You need to vote Greens.</span>

'Political reality must be grounded in physical reality, or it's completely useless'. That statement, by climate scientist Professor Hans Schellnhuber, was the starting point for a presentation a fortnight ago by climate policy researcher David Spratt at a public forum organised by the National Climate Emergency Summit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' target for 2030 is at least 75 per cent reductions in carbon pollution by 2030 and zero carbon no later than 2035, because that is what the science tells us will give us any hope of stabilising our climate below 1½ degrees of heating above pre-industrial temperatures. David Spratt argues we need to go even faster—that we need zero emissions at emergency speed by 2030. Last year, 2020, was the equal hottest year on record, and the planet is now 1.2 degrees hotter than it was 200 years ago. Frighteningly, regardless of what we do in the next nine years, we are likely to be at 1½ degrees hotter in 2030 because that heating is already baked in. Yet 1½ degrees hotter is not safe. Already, at 1.2 degrees hotter, climate tipping points have almost certainly already been passed for coral reefs, Arctic sea ice and the West Antarctic glaciers. The Amazon rainforest may have passed its tipping point. There's strong evidence that, at or around 1½ degrees hotter, the Greenland ice sheet will reach its tipping point. As for two degrees hotter, that's very unsafe, because 'hothouse Earth' tipping points may be reached at that point, where feedback loops mean the Earth just keeps on getting hotter, regardless of what we do to try and pull it back. Yet, the targets of the government and the Labor Party are consistent with a catastrophic three to five degrees of warming by 2100—within the lifetime of children alive today. David Spratt quoted from a seminal paper on climate tipping points:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence from tipping points alone suggests that we are in a state of planetary emergency: both the risk and urgency of the situation are acute … If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping point cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilisation. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  The Export Control Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020 amends the Export Control Act and is designed to support the implementation of the new export control framework. The amendment seeks to clarify the circumstances where a fit and proper person test is required for an application to vary registration of an establishment or to approve an alteration of an establishment. The amendment also expands the discretion of the secretary with respect to export permits. There is no doubt that Australia's previous legislative framework for agricultural production and certification of exports was overly complex—in fact, there were 17 acts. However, farmers and this parliament must remember that the act we are seeking to amend here today was initially introduced to the House on 7 December 2017, but lapsed. The act did not pass until March 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure to prioritise reforming the agricultural export framework is indicative of this government's attitude to farmers. They claim they are the government for farmers, but they are leaving our primary producers behind. Labor is glad that the government has finally decided to take steps to assist farmers with gaining and maintaining access to markets. However, farmers have been waiting for seven years for this government to do something for them. The minister has claimed that the new export framework is designed to ensure that Australia has appropriate regulatory settings to enable exports to grow and to help drive productivity and increase returns at the farm gate. But if the minister really cared about supporting the growth of agricultural exports and increasing productivity, he would not have abandoned farmers during this pandemic or waited three years to deliver this—for want of a better word—better framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional communities and our farmers have experienced extreme droughts. They've experienced floods. They've experienced bushfires and now a global pandemic. And if all that weren't enough, Australian agriculture's most high-volume and high-value market is under serious threat. Australian agricultural producers and exporters must be wondering: where are these new markets that Mr Littleproud promised? The answer is: Mr Littleproud doesn't know, because he hasn't put in the work. After three years of failing to legislate this new framework, it is not good enough that, when faced with the loss of high-volume and high-value markets, Mr Littleproud wiped his hands clean of the issue and told producers it wasn't his problem. To add insult to injury, despite the myriad challenges facing the agricultural sector, all this minister has to offer to deliver a $100 billion agricultural sector is a few dot points on a page. Farmers need and deserve more than a few dot points on a media release and obfuscation of responsibility. Farmers need the Liberal-National government to actually deliver outcomes, not just say they will. Mr Littleproud has been absent throughout this pandemic. He has refused to work with states to deliver the agricultural workers the sector so desperate needs. All this minister has managed to do is to pull together a workers' code that couldn't pass muster with chief health officers, and then blame the states when it didn't work. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk is extraordinarily cheap, and our farmers are suffering. Farmers deserve a government that will prioritise legislation designed to support the sector's growth. Labor supports growing agriculture to $100 billion by 2030, but we need a comprehensive plan to get there. A few dot points on a media release simply isn't good enough.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I rise, in the metaphorical sense, this evening to make some contributions in relation to the Export Control Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020. The bill makes amendments to the Export Control Act 2020 and seeks to do a couple of different things: clarify the operation of the fit and proper person test when verifying the registration of export establishments; provide greater flexibility in the requirements for lodging a notice of intention to export; enable the rules relevant to providing guidance in relation to the approval of export permits; enable the rules to modify the provisions of the act and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 in relation to the review of the tariff rate quota certificate decisions; and, enable the rules to incorporate matters contained in agreements between Australia and other countries that relate to tariff rate quotas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have a couple of serious concerns with the bill. While this bill claims to make minor, largely technical, amendments, the provisions which allow for changes to Export Control Act 2020 and the AAT Act are actually quite significant in nature. The function of these provisions is to limit the scope of the types of decisions that the AAT can make when reviewing tariff rate quota, TRQ,  certificates. We are primarily concerned about the implication of narrowing the recourse for exporters to challenge the outcome of a review on their TRQ certificates. The aspect we are least comfortable with is the fact that this bill is seeking to constrain the types of decisions that both the AAT and the department secretary can make and are reviewable in relation to TRQ certificates. They will not be able to make decisions on TRQ certificates where Australia has reached its tariff rate quota for any particular goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The implication we fear is that the context of this bill is primarily concerned with agricultural exports, and smaller, less powerful, less connected agricultural exporters risk being locked out of accessing and appealing TRQ certificate decisions where bigger exporters have been able to get access to them first. In principle, limiting the recourse for decisions made by government departments, where the department is empowered to make decisions on whether one private company can earn money over another, is of significant concern. As stated by the minister in response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is proposed that rules under section 386 of the Act, as amended by the Bill, will be made in equivalent terms to the current <span style="font-style:italic;">Export Control (Tariff Rate Quotas) Order 2019</span>, which prevents a person making a decision to overturn an initial decision if there is an insufficient amount of quota available at that time. This means there will be no change to the current administration of tariff rate quota certificates or impact on related trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we acknowledge that this bill seeks to retain the status quo for how TRQ certificates are administered, we are taking a principled decision not to support the provisions which allow for regulations to make changes to the original Export Control Act and the AAT Act. We see that they limit the capacity of individuals or entities to access a fair hearing when a review of decisions is limited in scope. This issue was raised at the level of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and we do not see that the minister's response satisfactorily accounts for this provision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments which we will move are very simple. We are seeking to remove items 9 to 13 of this bill, which will allow for the modification of the Export Control Act 2020 and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. The function of our amendments is to ensure that exporters seeking to challenge the decisions around TRQ certificates and entitlements have access to the full extent of available recourse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing I will reflect upon a very fine speech made in this chamber during the last sitting by Senator Carr, a distinguished and long-term member of this place. Senator Carr made a very compelling argument that, unless there was a very well articulated case made by the government and the Public Service—by the department—that legislative ability be put beyond the review or intervention of this chamber, such an act should not be taken. I will quote directly from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> in relation to the comments made by the scrutiny of bills committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee further stated that its concerns were heightened by the fact that the modifications may be in relation to review of decisions, and may therefore affect an individual's right to a fair hearing. It requested advice from the Minister as to why the provisions are considered necessary and appropriate, the circumstances in which it is envisioned the powers will be used, and whether they may trespass on the right to a fair hearing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of the production of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span>, the minister had not even deigned to answer. The answers that were subsequently given went in no way far enough to justify such a potential risk. In addition, the scrutiny of bills committee expressed concerns about the amendments which enabled delegated legislation to modify primary legislation. If I remember rightly, that was another key point made by Senator Carr in the previous sitting. The committee stated that such provisions, referred to as Henry VIII clauses, 'impact on the level of parliamentary scrutiny and may subvert the appropriate relationship between the parliament and the executive'. As such, the committee expected a sound justification for the use of a Henry VIII clause to be provided in the explanatory memorandum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance, the explanatory memorandum provides no justification as to why it is necessary and appropriate for rules to modify the operation of the act or the AAT Act. There's been no justification as to why they are necessary. In the absence of such a justification, I put it to the Senate that the only responsible legislative course of action is to remove such provisions, and that is what our amendments will seek to do. In the absence of the adoption of these amendments, we will proceed to vote against the bill, on the principle that such action should not be taken by the legislature without the relevant justification being made. We must draw a line in relation to the systemic, what now seems to be perpetual, undermining of this legislature. It is not out of any attempt to retain a sense of prestige or ego in ourselves but out of an acknowledgement that we are here, on behalf of our community, to do the work of scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a house of review, so we should never, without good cause, diminish our ability to review. This legislation does that. Based on some evidence the department gave to the relevant committee, this is justified on the basis of removing unnecessary administrative burden upon the department. There was a not dissimilar argument made a couple of weeks back in relation to the trade legislation, which prompted Senator Carr's contribution. This argument that basically having to do your job—having to put a bit of work in, having to do the admin—is a justification for undermining the legislative purview of Australia's ultimate chamber of review should be roundly rejected as nonsense, absolute nonsense. So, as I said, should the amendments that we will offer fail to gain the support of the Senate, we shall vote against the legislation. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282728" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McMAHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020. This bill is important as it will help modernise Australia's trade environment and ensure our farmers have continued and reliable access to overseas markets. The bill will amend the Export Control Act to make sure that it is fit for purpose. It will streamline and consolidate existing export controls. The bill will make five amendments to the act. Firstly, it will clarify the application of the fit-and-proper-person test to vary a registration of, or to approve an alteration of, an establishment. Secondly, it will enable the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment to make rules to enable a notice of intention to export a consignment of prescribed goods to be approved or refused. Thirdly, it will enable the secretary to make rules to prescribe requirements for determining whether to issue an export permit. Fourthly, it will modify how certain provisions apply to reviews of decisions for tariff rate quotas. Finally, it will clarify which instruments may be incorporated into the framework to calculate the tariff rate quotas for goods. Our farmers, producers and agricultural exporters are the lifeblood of our nation, and they must be provided with an environment that is easy to navigate and one that allows them to thrive, particularly in COVID, and hopefully post-COVID, environments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is particularly important to the Northern Territory, where our two biggest agricultural products, cattle and mangoes, have large export markets. We have a good reputation for high-quality produce. We can't compete on price—Labor and the unions have seen to that. We can't compete on quantity—most countries in the world produce cattle and most countries in the tropics produce mangoes. The only things we can compete on are proximity to markets in the case of cattle and buffalo, which are mostly going to Indonesia and Vietnam, and quality, again, with our cattle, and with our mangoes into Asia and the UAE. It is vitally important to ensure we continue to develop legislation to support these markets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor don't support agriculture and rural Australia. This was evident in 2011 when they recklessly slammed a live export ban on the cattle industry. I can't tell you how devastating this ban was, particularly in the Northern Territory and certainly to my home town of Katherine. Producers overnight had no income. They had no capacity to buy or pay for goods or services. This immediately flowed on to associated industries, such as transport, feed producers, stock and station agents, and veterinary practices. In a small town the flow-on was immediate and severe. Suddenly a large proportion of the town could no longer go to a restaurant or a cafe, could no longer buy something from a retail outlet and could no longer afford to get something fixed on their home or property. It devastated our economy and it did so for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we as a government do care and do support our agricultural industries. We must give them all the support and assistance we can and use the levers at our disposal to ensure they have the best possible opportunities to maintain and grow export markets. This bill will reduce some of the red tape and congestion that can be impediments to their trade. The Liberals and Nationals government has announced a sweeping set of reforms and investment in Australia's agricultural export sector to help drive economic recovery in rural, regional and remote Australia and the nation more broadly. The investment is a major drawdown payment on achieving a $100 billion agricultural sector by 2030. It currently stands at $65 billion. It is an ambitious target, but one that's very achievable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our investment and reform agenda is an opportunity to reimagine our services from an exporter's perspective. The government wants to get out of the way of business but provide a seamless service experience. By using advanced technology we will significantly transform how the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment delivers its services. In the meantime we will freeze fees and charges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing $328.4 million in the agricultural exports system, to modernise Australia's training environment and to lead a strong economic recovery. We have provided $222.2 million to transform our export systems, including contributing to a single digital one-stop shop, fast-tracking goods to international markets. We have invested $14.3 million to improve our regulation, particularly for the live animal and seafood industries, to provide greater access for exporters refocusing their businesses into new markets. Live animal exports have remained relatively strong, but we've all heard about the lobster industry and their suffering at the hands of the Chinese market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and Nationals government has also provided $10.9 million to reduce the regulatory burden on meat processors and maintain Australia's status as a leading source of premium animal products. Our friends in the opposite back corner would like to ban live exports today. I'm sure they will rejoice at this announcement, as increased processing will eventually replace live exports. But we are doing much more and have invested $10 million for streamlined plant export services, giving farmers quicker, easier and cheaper access to overseas markets. There is $71.1 million in direct cost savings to exporters, including immediate price freezes, plus $21.4 million in reform-driven fee reductions over four years. These investments are anticipated to return benefits of at least $236 million to the sector as we progress towards the target of a $100 billion agricultural sector by 2030—remember that ambitious but achievable target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With about two-thirds of Australia's agricultural products being exported, it is vital that we support these exporters and create an environment in which they and Australia, as a whole, benefit, and that is exactly what we have done. We've invested $72.7 million to help Australian agribusinesses expand their export markets as part of the Agri-Business Expansion Initiative. There is $669 million to address air freight shortages and disrupted supply chains for agricultural and fisheries exports through the International Freight Assistance Mechanism, $11.4 million to enhance the international competitiveness and profitability of the horticulture sector, $6.14 million to extend the Package Assisting Small Exporters grant process and $5.1 million to reduce the impact of non-tariff measures by funding industry based analysis. These initiatives build on the $51.3 million commitment under the growing Australian agricultural exports measure from 2018-19 to expand our agricultural exports and seize market access opportunities in global food chains. This includes funding for the overseas agriculture counsellor network and expansion into new locations such as Mexico, Chile and the UK.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, the government has also beefed up its Agri-Business Expansion Initiative, which is a targeted measure being put in place to help Australian farming, forestry and fishing exporters expand and diversify their export markets. We understand only too well how important that is in the face of what's become very apparent to us with regard to the Chinese markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, and it's worth repeating because it is such a good initiative, the government is investing $72.7 million to help Australian agribusinesses expand their export markets as part of the Agri-Business Expansion Initiative. This includes $42.9 million to support 2,000 agrifood exporters through the Australian-led accelerate program, providing targeted advice and trade missions to help exporters grow in new and existing markets. We have also invested $18.4 million to extend the Agricultural Trade and Market Access Cooperation Program to develop strategic partnerships with industry to support trade expansion and diversification; $6.8 million to accelerate the negotiation of technical agreements to provide food safety, animal health and biosecurity protocols with trading partners by boosting our scientific and technical capabilities; $3.5 million for three new short-term agricultural counsellors, able to be rapidly deployed to pursue market access priorities with the greatest commercial prospects to complement the work of our existing 22 agricultural counsellors; and $1 million for marketing intelligence and analysis to assist in identifying opportunities for exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is important not just to our farmers and agricultural exporters but to the whole of the country, because if our farmers thrive the rest of the country thrives too. This is a government that is committed to making the right choices to help our farmers and exporters to maintain and grow their markets and contribute to Australia growing a strong and healthy economy. We know that, when our rural industries thrive, when the bush is doing well, the nation as a whole does well. Certainly for the Northern Territory, where export is such a vital part of our agricultural industries, streamlining the process—removing the red tape, making it easier for exporters to do business—is an absolutely vital function of this government. This government, unlike those on the other side, has shown that it cares for rural areas, regional areas, primary producers and exporters. This government will continue to support all those industries now and well into the future. I am very happy to commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  The bill that is before us, the Export Control Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020, is required to amend parts of the Export Control Act 2020. The bill addresses issues identified since the Export Control Act received royal assent on 6 March 2020, following consultation with key industry stakeholders. The bill will clarify the application of a fit and proper person test for variations of registration of, or to approve an alteration of, an establishment. It will enable the secretary to make rules to enable a notice of intention to export a consignment of prescribed goods to be approved or refused. Furthermore, the bill will modify how certain provisions apply to reviewable decisions for tariff rate quotas and will enable the secretary to make rules to prescribe requirements for determining whether to issue an export permit. The bill will also clarify which instruments may be incorporated in the framework to calculate the tariff rate quotas for goods. The bill will support the implementation of the new export control framework and minimise the administrative burden for Australia's agricultural export industries and stakeholders. The bill will support the initiatives of the Morrison-McCormack government to bust congestion in regulation and ensure that agricultural industries come out firing after the threat of the coronavirus has passed. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

The intention of the bill that's before us is to provide greater clarity under the Export Control Act, and the inclusion of tariff rate certificates in addition to tariff rate entitlements reflects the fact that some of the trading partners use different terms. It's also important to note that the measure is already in the Export Control Act 2020, and the proposed government bill seeks to avoid confusion for exporters.</span>

The bill and the retrospective measures also make clear that exporters will be unable to seek a formal review of the quota allocated to them, where the full quota has been allocated. Quota arrangements are negotiated as part of bilateral arrangements, regional and multilateral trade agreements, and it would be inappropriate for the department and the government to be put in a position where it is exceeding its agreed quotas and allocations. That is the reason why we will not be supporting your amendment, Senator Steele-John.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  As noted by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, there is a question as to whether this bill, as it currently stands, may trespass on an individual's or an entity's right to a fair hearing, because of the amendments that it makes to the relevant legislation relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As I said in my first contribution to this debate, when combined with the so-called Henry VIII clause within this bill, these two aspects of this legislation take something which would otherwise be seen as purely administrative and they put up some pretty significant red flags. I'm speaking particularly to the ALP when I'm thinking here that there have been a few times during the course of my time here when I've been genuinely moved and motivated by a speech made by a member of this place. One of those times, however, was the speech made by Senator Carr in the previous sitting in relation to the absolutely urgent need that this house of review, this chamber of review, reassert its prerogative to review actions and decisions made by the government, under legislation, and that it in no way volunteer the opportunity for that power to be taken away unless there's a good reason made for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's our view in the Greens that a good enough reason has not been made for the inclusion of the so-called Henry VIII clause here. And, additionally, there has been nowhere near the compelling case made to remove relevant decisions from the purview of the AAT. The amendment offered by the Greens this evening addresses these flaws in the legislation, and I commend it to the Senate on that basis. </span>

The way that it's been designed allows new entrants and small exporters to be able to access those quotas as well. So it is just simply a means of us being able to provide all exporters with an opportunity to be able to participate in our export markets. Whilst I've heard your concerns, we do not believe that the amendment that you are putting forward will improve the bill. We believe it will be detrimental to the bill. Therefore, we won't be supporting it. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:01</span>):  Labor have some 10 amendments to this bill. We had sought to move them together, but I understand from negotiations that we need to split them up. The reason Labor will be moving these amendments today is that the scheme as it currently stands does not deliver on the promise for redress made by this parliament—redress that's timely, redress that does not retraumatise and redress that does not leave survivors missing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of this scheme as rolled out by the government does not reflect the will of this parliament. It falls short of the original recommendations of the royal commission. Our amendments seek to address major structural shortcomings of the scheme. We seek to bring the scheme back in line with the original intention and motivation of the royal commission, to end the delays caused by institutions not doing the right thing by not joining the scheme and to ensure no-one misses out through strengthening funders-of-last-resort provisions and the introduction of an advanced payment scheme. We seek to do this by delivering full redress for survivors by lifting the cap on payments as prescribed by the royal commission; making sure that prior payments are not indexed to take away from a redress payment, including from members of the stolen generations who were paid redress for the fact they were removed as children, not necessarily for the sexual abuse that they suffered at the hands of the perpetrators in the institutions that they were stolen away to; making sure that a request for a review of redress and the review of that offer cannot result in that offer being reduced; scrapping the existing and arbitrary assessment matrix and delivering on one that is fair and properly recognises the full impact of abuse; and ensuring ongoing psychological and other forms of cultural support for survivors throughout their lives. After so long, it is time for this parliament to again reflect on the promise that it made to deliver redress to survivors of childhood sexual abuse within Australian institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity tonight in this chamber to improve this scheme, and this parliament should deliver on that. We are a quarter way through the 10-year life of this scheme, and still the number of redress payments are tracking well below what was expected. Do you know what this means? This means that there are institutions out there that know. They've got records; they've heard of how many victims inside those institutions have experienced abuse. And even though those institutions have signed up and are ready to make those payments under this scheme, still there is enough deterrent to people to not do the paperwork and sign up. Our amendments today are designed to help clear that path, to make the application and pursuit of redress that much easier for victims and survivors. It's a clear warning sign, the low take-up rate and the low number of payments, and we have a responsibility today to do something about that. I would like to ask the minister this evening: are you aware that many of the concerns that survivors have raised with the matrix and its potential use were, indeed, identified before this scheme was even implemented and in the early debates we had about this legislation?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  In a broad response to the contribution just made by Senator Pratt, I would say a couple of things. First and foremost, there seems to be a lack of understanding by those opposite about how this scheme was actually designed to operate. It's designed to operate in such a way that all of the states and territories have a level of responsibility and commitment towards this scheme. A board has been established in conjunction with the Commonwealth government that requires the unanimous agreement for any changes to the scheme to actually be negotiated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, what the contribution just given to us failed to recognise is the fact that, as part of the establishment of the scheme in the first place, we would undertake a statutory two-year review by an independent assessor. That person appointed is Robyn Kruk AO. Robyn was the person who undertook the review of the redress scheme that was established inside the military, or the defence forces, and she is due to report on that review in a couple of weeks time. Her review has sought advice from a number of different sources, but, most particularly, her review has been informed by interviews with survivors and in consultation with survivors. What the government wishes to do as part of the process of this review is wait to find out what the reviewer recommends so that we are able to provide a formal, independent review that has actually taken into account the voice of survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In principle, there is nothing to say that many of the amendments that have been put forward by the opposition today don't have very good merit to them and, in principle, the government are certainly not arguing against them. But what we are saying is: 'You know the process; you understand the review's in place.' I have had significant and detailed conversations with the shadow minister in the other place and it was tremendously disappointing to see those opposite are still intending to move these amendments and, in doing so, seek to supersede or pre-empt the response from our independent reviewer, who has been informed by survivors. The government will not be supporting any of the amendments that have been put forward by the opposition, because we actually believe there is an appropriate process to go through to enable us to have a firm and solid independent benchmark against which we can make continuous improvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Pratt, we on this side do not shy away from the fact that this scheme has not been perfect, but we do wish to work together in a multipartisan way to make sure this scheme is the best it can be. Coming in here two weeks before the independent reviewer is due to table her report, which I have agreed to make public, suggests to me that you're not perhaps as genuine as you might be suggesting you are.</span>

We know that, when we started off with this scheme, it certainly did not start off as well as we would have liked it to. The complexity of the applications that we received from survivors was much greater than we ever imagined. But we don't shy away from the fact that we are absolutely committed to continuous improvement. We will give an absolute commitment to say that we will work with the state and territory ministers, informed by the review and informed by the advice that we've received from survivors, to make sure that we continue to provide the redress in the most timely way we can for survivors who have come forward.</span>

You say, 'Yes, it's coming soon, so why are you pursuing these amendments now?', and yet then you go on to say, 'Well, any changes still have to go to the redress board in order to make any changes to this act.' Minister, I want to ask you: given the issues with the matrix, given the indexing of payments, given the problem of the number of redress payments tracking below what was expected, given the delays caused by institutions not joining the scheme, given the issues around strengthening funders of last resort to ensure that everyone has access—but, in particular, the issue of things like indexing and the matrix—what is your advice to survivors today? If they are concerned about the current management of the Redress Scheme and the current provisions of the act, should they wait to put their applications in? Will they be judged according to the old matrix or the new one? Will they be invited to resubmit their applications? Noting that this review is coming, you must have some idea of the kinds of issues that you are going to need to take to this board, rather than just saying, 'Wait and see.' You have to be able to actively manage, right here and now, the expectations of survivors; otherwise they might be thinking, 'Well, I'm going to have to wait two more years to put my application for redress in.' Yet they may well find that nothing changes. What is your advice to survivors today, Minister?</span>

Her review will be informed by that advice. The amendments before us today have not been informed by a formal process of consultation with survivors, and I believe the most responsible thing that I as the minister can do, that this government can do and that the governments of states and territories can do is wait and have the independent review informed by survivors before we make decisions about any changes going forward.</span>

If you would like me to do so, I would be happy to go through some of the specifics of those now. If you look at the form of the amendments that we seek to move from (3) onwards, the issues that are going to come up in the review are very closely matched to the issues that we raise in these amendments and, again, would enable you in large part—and we can wait to be corrected because you are going to have to legislate to make these changes at some point in the future anyway—to move much more quickly in response to that review in a couple of weeks time. It would enable you to take the findings of the review and use the amendments made in this place to respond flexibly and take new arrangements to the board. So, Minister, I again ask you to reflect on the need to urgently pass these amendments today, rather than waiting, as you have suggested, until the outcome of the review.</span>

As I indicated in my second contribution, can I ask: if survivors will no longer be provided with the full list of associate institutions under these amendments, what are you going to do to ensure survivors can access this information in alternative ways? As I made the comment in my second reading amendment, they have a right to know who they are signing the fact they won't undertake any civil litigation away to.</span>

The purpose of this measure, I suppose, is to not put a huge list of institutions to a survivor, but they will be able to get access to the actual institutions. The changes have been sought to be put in place because we've been advised of the fact that this is a more trauma-informed way of being able to provide the information to survivors.</span>

For that reason, there was no provision in the primary legislation for the funder of last resort to actually be shared between various jurisdictions. This legislation seeks to make sure that you can have more than one funder of last resort so that the defunct institutions' share of the liability or the redress cost is divided equally between the two government institutions. At the moment, it doesn't actually work like that. It just puts clarity back into it and gives us a quick and easy mechanism, contained within the actual act, to be able to do it. At the moment, there's silence in the act in relation to being able to split the funding liability of a defunct institution.</span>

You'll be aware that this is close to a lot of people's hearts, particularly Western Australians. This is a very tricky issue; I will freely and frankly acknowledge that. Could you please provide the Senate with an update on the ongoing negotiations and consideration of this issue, given that, unless something is done, Fairbridge Restored will soon, by the very nature of the UK legislation, cease to exist, as I understand it, unless there's been some progress?</span>

I know that this has been a particular issue for the Western Australian senators in this place and others in this parliament, not least due to the sizable number of people involved with Fairbridge. As a result of Fairbridge Restored's refusal to join the scheme, we named and shamed them on 1 July last year. We are continuing to consider and work through the particular options for how we can ensure that we get the redress that the survivors of that particular institution deserve. At the moment, we are in negotiations. We have engaged with the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Government Solicitor in relation to the unique situation in terms of the relationship between Fairbridge Restored and the Prince's Trust. Due to the stage of those negotiations, I can't really give you a lot more information. We need to move to the settlement, and we would not seek to prejudice the outcome of those negotiations by any commentary here. We will continue to advance the work to make sure that we resolve this issue. We are confident that we will be able to find a solution that can be progressed to ensure that survivors of that particular institution can get the redress that they deserve. I regret that I can't give you any more detail than that.</span>

I say this having just over the last couple of days got a return on an FOI about the National Archives review. I note it was commenced in April 2019, it was provided to the minister in February 2020 and it's still not public. I listened to what you said. You suggest that these amendments might be premature, but I will of course give much stronger consideration to supporting Labor's amendments or at least some of the amendments if indeed any legislation that's likely to remedy or deal with some of these issues is in fact two years away. I'm just trying to get a feel. You're going to get the review at some stage in the next couple of weeks. I wonder how long you're anticipating considering the review. If you could give a time line—best endeavours. I want to get a feel for that please, Minister.</span>

This is the process that will occur. The report will be provided to the government sometime in the next few weeks—hopefully, by the end of this month. The report will then be provided to the other members of the redress board—the ministers in the states and territories who have responsibility for redress in their particular jurisdiction. Then we will seek to meet straight afterwards. We're meeting in April, so the state and territory ministers will have a month to consider the recommendations in the review. We will meet in April. At that meeting we will consider those recommendations and seek for decisions to be made as to whether there is unanimous support to implement those recommendations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that has failed to be realised in this place is that the federal government does not have the capacity to act unilaterally and make changes. Because of the way the redress act is written and the way the board is established, we require the support of the states and territories. This is a partnership agreement. That's the way it has been set up. Obviously much of the responsibility exists within those state and territory jurisdictions. I can certainly give you a commitment that the Commonwealth seek to move as quickly as we possibly can, but I can't pre-empt, firstly, what the report is going to say, which is what these amendments seek to do, and, secondly, I can't pre-empt what agreement I'll be able to reach around the redress board table. But I can give you an absolute commitment that the review will be provided to the states and territories immediately after the Commonwealth government receives it. I can give you a commitment that I will be meeting with the redress board in April, at which time we will consider those recommendations. I can also give you a commitment that, as soon as the board has agreed to it, I will be releasing the report so that it is available for public review.</span>

As I said, the federal government cannot unilaterally make a decision on behalf of the redress board, which is what these amendments seek to do. What I would seek to do, with any changes to the redress act that are recommended by the review, is take them to the redress board for approval, because there may be situations where they have to also undertake legislative amendment within their own jurisdictions, and get their agreement so that when I come back to this place—and I give you an undertaking that we will move as quickly as we possibly can—I know I'll be coming back with the full support and agreement of the other members of the redress board.</span>

We have a redress board meeting that has already been scheduled for April to give the other members the opportunity to consider the report, and at that redress meeting the matters that are contained in the report will be considered. So that is the process that has already been put in place. And, as I said, I will also make the report available publicly.</span>

It is a decision of the parliaments of the states and territories across Australia. There is an agreed process. It was agreed in this place when the scheme was stood up. I understand that everybody in this place agreed to the establishment of the scheme in its current format. As part of that process, we undertook to have a two-year review because we believed in setting up a scheme of this magnitude. This is a very complex scheme and it has proved to be very difficult. We are not shying away from the fact that it has been a very difficult scheme. But we are absolutely committed to its continuous improvement, and part of that is making sure that we allow the independent review to be undertaken and to provide that advice back to us. </span>

I will not pre-empt the views of survivors that are contained in that review for the political purposes of this chamber. </span>

What we have outlined here is to call on the minister to consider the action that needs to be taken to increase the cap from $150,000 to $200,000 and, within 90 days of the commencement of this section, report on what the minister has done or plans to do to have the cap increased and, if the minister has not done and does not plan to do anything, the minister's reasons for this. You can do all of those things in a manner that is consistent with the review, except if the review were to say, 'Well, I guess we don't want to recognise the rest of the public debate that clearly argues that the cap is too low, that $150,000 is an inadequate cap and that it needs to be increased to $200,000.' </span>

It doesn't restrain you in any way, other than committing you to working through a process on what actions you will undertake to increase the cap. </span>

Nothing changes from that. I've given an absolute commitment to this place, and I'll continue to give a commitment to this place, to work through the appropriate processes to make sure that I am listening to the voices of survivors through the most appropriate means, and that is the independent review, not a political discourse. </span>

This amendment asks that a review cannot result in a reduced payment. I'm sure these issues will come up in the review that you are referring to. It is a commonsense safeguard. It is a safeguard that could be enacted and considered by the parliament now so that this government and the parliament can make progress on these issues. It's such a simple amendment, but it would mean so much to those in the scheme. As we know, people are not asking for a review of their payments, because they fear that the amount being offered will be reduced. It's connected with the complexities in the matrix and the application, in that there are a whole range of reasons that the sum offered to them is not in any way reflecting what they think it should be and what any other assessment, if you actually were to go through the particulars of their case, would show adequate redress to be. </span>

I'd like to inform the chamber that I had very detailed discussions with shadow minister Burney in the other place. It was a matter she raised to me when she came to speak to me about this particular bill. I give an undertaking to the shadow minister that I would investigate any specific situation that the shadow minister was aware of where somebody had sought a review and the review had come back and indicated they had a decrease in payment. I'm still waiting for Ms Burney to come back to me. In any situation in this place, if there has been a detrimental outcome or an outcome that has been delivered through my department that has caused concern to somebody's constituent, my door remains open. As I said, I have never received any advice from Ms Burney about any instance where this has happened, despite the fact it has been spoken about. I have asked as part of the review process that this issue be considered. I am happy to have a look at any situation. If Senator Pratt has a particular case she would like me to undertake an investigation on, I'm more than happy to do so. But do not come in here and talk about hypotheticals when I am unaware whether you're aware of anybody who has received a review that has resulted in a decreased payment being undertaken. My understanding of the situation as it currently exists is if an error has been made by my department in an assessment resulting in the review, showing that—</span>

However, it would make sense, so we're not calling everyone down to the chamber after individual debates, for me to outline all of the amendments so that we can then put the questions one after the other, if that seems to make sense to others. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (1) is so that a review should not result in a reduced payment. Our second amendment was to hold the government to account on its naming and shaming of non-participating institutions, so amendment (2) amends schedule 1, page 15, and inserts a section that legislates that the government must name an institution if, after the first six months where an application has been made, that it continues not to want to participate. It introduces a requirement that the minister names any institution that refuses to join the Redress Scheme within six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the government's policy. I acknowledge that that policy was put in place after significant pressure from survivors, and Labor brought voice to that within the parliament. But this naming and shaming is not guaranteed. It requires proactive management by the government. I've no doubt you'll do the right thing, but this is also parliament wanting to express its will about this policy and that this policy should be legislated. If your undertaking as a minister is entirely consistent with ours as a parliament that sees this as important, as you say, then we've got a moral duty in this place to vote this amendment up. Participating in redress is a part of any institution's social licence, and we in this parliament have an expectation that a failure to participate should have the full glare of the Australian community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The further amendments are, as I outlined, deliberately structured to give the government flexibility and latitude—flexibility to negotiate with the states and territories to make the changes needed by the scheme. They foreshadow very much a commitment to not only the outcomes of the review but the issues that have been identified in public debate, in parliamentary committees and by senators in this place. We don't need to wait for the review to know how substantial these issues are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a clear commitment from the government to bring the scheme back to what the royal commission intended. We need leadership, not, 'We're just going to wait for the review.' We need leadership, because we know that that's what survivors of abuse have been saying. They require the minister to report to parliament on what steps will be taken to achieve these changes within 90 days. There's no reason for the government and the minister not to accept this responsibility and this level of scrutiny. Indeed, it is our right to scrutinise these movements, not just that of the committee that's made up by the states. These issues include increasing the cap on redress payments, as we've already outlined in debate, with flexibility. One of our amendments calls on you to outline your actions on increasing the cap. That report should be tabled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On ending the indexing of relevant prior payments, what the minister has done, or plans to do, to have indexing ended, as mentioned in the subsection, must be reported. If the minister has not done, and does not plan to do, anything, the minister must give reasons for this. We've seen the legacy of the impact of prior payments being indexed, and it's heartbreaking to hear the stories of people who go through the onerous process of retelling the story of their abuse to then barely getting any redress once a tiny payment from years ago is indexed. People feel insulted and disrespected when this happens. It's incredibly difficult for people to dredge this up, and they should feel they are being left empty-handed after this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On deducting prior payments—and this is in amendment (5) of sheet 1196—we need safeguards to ensure that the prior payments deducted from redress are relevant prior payments. Again, I'm sure this issue will come up in the review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got schedule 1, item 51 at amendment (6)—advance payment schemes for elderly and ill applicants. We know that too many ill and elderly people who have done applications have already died. It's a scheme already working well in Scotland. There's no reason that you should not accept the will of the Senate today on behalf of survivors of abuse to support this amendment. It would not cost more. It would just give people recognition and peace of mind at the end of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, amendment (7) is in relation to the funder of last resort. This amendment makes sure that no-one misses out on redress. If an organisation has folded and no longer has any links to a continuing organisation or if an organisation genuinely does not have the resources to participate in the scheme, the government should make sure redress is paid. This, of course, leaves it open for the government to continue to pursue avenues of seeking those moneys from other institutions. But you can't put people—victims of places like Fairbridge—through the prospect of seeking redress and then tell them there's nothing on the table. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (8) deals with psychological counselling and support. As Senator Smith already highlighted in the earlier debates today, we need to make sure that ongoing counselling and support is provided but also that it's culturally appropriate. The money, as the act is currently structured, is paid in a lump sum and it's supposed to be enough for a lifetime. People can be left with as little as $1,250 for their lifelong counselling and support needs. So, again, this amendment calls on you to report on what the minister has done and plans to do to ensure that those resources are flexible and available to people over their lifetime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (9) deals with better recognising the impact of sexual abuse. This is very significant, and I would hope that the report of the review picks this up. Indeed, the government should—and has the capacity to—respond to that issue now. One of the reasons I think that some survivors are unhappy with the offers that are being put to them is actually about the cruel and arbitrary nature of the matrix. I recall that when these issues were discussed in the Senate in the past, including in hearings about the legislation and the nature of the matrix, we couldn't get details from the bureaucrats at the table in relation to how the matrix would work. It seemed that there was a concern that the matrix would somehow be gamed. I know that, when people apply and go to fill out the matrix, the notes and introductory statements ask people to be explicit as to the nature of their abuse. However, the evidence that we have heard before the joint committee, and I'm sure it's been an issue before other committees, is that survivors of abuse do find it very difficult to be completely forthcoming about that, and they believe that those assessing these should be able to read between the lines. I foreshadow that I will be moving opposition amendment (1) on sheet 1196. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:58</span>):  Senator Pratt, I think that, in moving this amendment in relation to the naming and shaming, you have misrepresented what we already do and how the scheme operates in relation to the naming and shaming of institutions that fail to join the scheme within the timeframe that has been allocated to them. I think you fail to understand that, in many instances, these are incredibly sensitive situations and every application that we receive is different in some way, so the scheme needs to retain the flexibility to make sure that we are acting in the best interests of the survivor and providing the information to the survivor. When you end up with some extraordinarily complex applications—some of them are terribly heartbreaking to read—that have named many, many institutions, the process whereby we make sure that we get all the institutions to join is extremely complex. What we have sought to do is to make a commitment to this place through the redress board—sanctioned by the redress board—to name and shame organisations that have not joined up within six months of being notified that they have been named in an application. We made the same provisions for those organisations that were named in the royal commission. We have clearly honoured that commitment. On 1 July we named and shamed six institutions. It was pleasing to find that two of those joined the scheme subsequently. On 1 January this year we didn't have to name any institutions, because all institutions that had exceeded the time period we put in place had joined the scheme. That enabled us to progress the applications of survivors against those institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We made a further commitment, which was approved through the redress board, that, from the federal government's perspective, no further grants could be accessed by an institution that failed in its moral obligation to join the scheme. That is already in place. I'm pleased to be able to advise this chamber that the state and territory governments have also instigated proceedings to make sure that no institution that is named is able to access grants from their respective jurisdictions either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing that we announced and did as part of our name-and-shame exercise—and, as I said, pleasingly we didn't have to name and shame any further institutions on 1 January this year—was that, through the process of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, we would be revoking charitable status for any organisation that did not join the scheme. This will have a significant impact on any organisation that has been named by the scheme and doesn't do the right thing. Their charitable status will be revoked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been absolutely committed and we have done everything that we said we would do. We have committed into the future, through changes to the act, that we will continue to name organisations. We got the policy through the redress board to say that any institution would have six months to join from the time that they were advised they'd been named by an application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the many organisations that have not had an application named against them but have joined the scheme. These are organisations that have a history of working with children and have taken their responsibility of working with children going forward to such a degree that they have joined the scheme without an application against them. That means that if in the future we receive an application against that institution we won't have to wait to go through the six-month process for them to join, because they'll have already joined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government, in conjunction with the state governments through the redress board and in the actions that have been taken, have demonstrated our absolute commitment to making sure we name and shame organisations that do not join up to the scheme, as well as taking further sanctions and actions against those organisations to penalise them in a monetary way. We seek to maintain a level of maximum flexibility, understanding the sensitivity of the scheme, so that the government, as the scheme operator with the states and territories, can make sure we're doing the best we possibly can to have a trauma-informed response to survivors, so we can get them their redress in the least traumatic and fastest possible way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:03</span>):  Thank you for taking to your feet so I can finish outlining our amendments. I do note you responded to amendment (2), but, for your clarification, the first question before the chair will be amendment (1), which is about the review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (9) requires that the impact of abuse be better recognised. In the committees I've participated in, survivors have told us about the arbitrary nature of the matrix, which links payments to the nature of the abuse; for example, was it physical, was it penetrative, was it exposure, was it contact, was it penetrative rape, was it fingers—what was the nature of the penetration and what sex organs were involved?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has actually been very hard for some survivors of abuse to be so explicit. In some cases, while they've outlined the very traumatic impact that the abuse has had on them, they haven't been able to bring themselves to be as explicit as they need to be in their documentation. Others have outlined the nature of their abuse but the matrix has discounted it because it rates payments on the basis of the nature of the act that took place, rather than on the impact of that abuse. This amendment calls on the government to report again on these issues so that payments for abuse are calculated independently, as recommended by the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (10) requires non-participating organisations to participate. It makes sure that, if an organisation refuses to participate in the scheme or deliberately restructures its assets so as to appear that it can't participate, the government will be able to get funds from it in order to pay redress. This could take the form of a levy or collection through the tax system. As we know, there are constitutional limits on seizing assets; however, it is indeed unacceptable for organisations to simply refuse to participate or to hide their assets. They need to be compelled to do so. It needs to be legislated that they pay redress to those they have hurt.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I've ripped through our 10 amendments, and I now seek to move our amendment (1).

I guess the second part of my question is redundant, in that you say all of these issues will be traversed. That takes me to amendment (3), if I may, in relation to the cap. It's my understanding that the royal commission recommended a minimum of $10,000 in a payment and a maximum of $200,000, as is proposed to be considered here, and that, indeed, $65,000 was considered to be the average payment. So that amendment is of particular interest to me because the royal commission made a specific recommendation in respect of this.</span>

However, in order for us to be able to get the unanimous agreement that we required with the redress board—the state and territory ministers and the governance board—it was the view of that board that the maximum payment be $150,000. We have sought for the reviewer to undertake an assessment as to that particular number. You're also quite correct that the royal commission suggested that the average payment would be $65,000. It actually has proved to be higher than that. The average payment was $83,400, so certainly we are seeing payments higher than the royal commission anticipated. But it was by virtue of the fact that we required the unanimous agreement of the states and territories, who are represented on the governance board, that the decision of the scheme, when it was set up, was $150,000. But, as I said, it is a matter being considered by the review.</span>

The Greens will be supporting these amendments because we think that these issues have been well traversed and it's time that we did see some movement on them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of amendment (1), which is, as I understand it, the amendment that Senator Pratt has just moved, I did listen to the minister's answer to the question on this and the fact that you asked for examples. The fact here is that the very existence of this particular process, where somebody thinks that they could have their payment reduced, actually puts people off seeking a review. That's why we think this is so important; it's so that people aren't put off. People are traumatised by the scheme. A lot of people, I will acknowledge, have had a good experience, but a lot of other people haven't, and they find the whole process retraumatising. We hear from people who say that they start to do the form and just doing the form retraumatises them because they rethink about it. They leave it for a while before they go back to it, before they complete the form. So I can totally see how people could be put off seeking a review having gone through the process and then thinking that their payment might be reduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we think this is particularly important and we think these amendments—for example, increasing the cap from $150,000 to $200,000—are, as I said, way past time. The Greens made it plain at the time that we actually supported that—it should have been $200,000 all along. It's the same with the indexation of prior payments. Survivors have been complaining and deeply concerned about this since the very get-go. I do acknowledge that the government has done a lot of work to get institutions to sign up, but having this in legislation gives effect to that, to something the government has been doing now. This is the same with the other amendments, but I'll come back to those as Senator Pratt moves each one.</span>

I've been on, I think, all of the various committees looking at redress, both prior to looking at legislation and the legislation itself, and also on the current joint committee and the previous committee, and I have consistently heard evidence about people's concerns around ongoing psychological support. In particular, during the joint committee's hearing following the implementation of the scheme, there has consistently been deep, deep concern about the insufficiency of the funding and about the process for psychological and trauma-informed support. So we support that amendment.</span>

Also, we support amendment (10). We're supportive of moves that constructively compel institutions to join the scheme.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:51</span>):  It is often said that the past teaches us about the present, in that history gives us the tools to analyse what has gone before. Tonight I rise to highlight two significant Tasmanians. Both of these significant Tasmanians are outstanding political leaders, both of whom positively impacted our nation during critical stages of our state's and nation's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a way, I suppose you could describe them as one of the original power couples: Joseph and Enid Lyons. Joseph is Tasmania's only Prime Minister to date—but, hopefully, not the last—and Dame Enid was the first woman elected to the House of Representatives and to serve in federal cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Tasmanian Premier between 1923 and 1928 and then Prime Minister from 1932 until his death in 1939, Joseph Lyons, or Joe, is arguably Tasmania's most successful politician. Known as 'Honest Joe', his personal popularity was an influencing factor in the governments he led. In a political career that spanned three decades, Joe served in the Tasmanian parliament during World War I and federal parliament during the Great Depression in the 1930s. As Prime Minister, Joe oversaw the rebuilding of the Australian economy after the Great Depression and established the Commonwealth Grants Commission. He pursued independent foreign policies, reducing Australia's reliance on Britain, and oversaw the creation of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1932. Joe was also Prime Minister during Edward VIII's abdication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While he began his political career in the Australian Labor Party, Joe later became the founding leader of the United Australia Party, the UAP, which later became the Liberal Party. Joe had a steady hand when it came to managing the country's finances. He followed the trusted principles of low inflation, reducing government debt, balancing the budget and repaying loans. These are principles we should and do still aspire to today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born at Stanley in the north-west of Tasmania in 1879, Joe was the fifth of Michael and Ellen Lyons' eight children. Ellen was born in County Kildare, Ireland, and arrived in Australia in 1857, while Michael was born in Tasmania to Irish immigrants. After attending government and Catholic schools in Ulverstone and Stanley, Joe started working as a pupil-teacher at Stanley state school when he was 15. As a qualified teacher, he was posted around the state between 1901 and 1907 before attending Hobart Teachers College when it first opened. Joe then taught at the Glen Dhu and Wellington Square state schools in Launceston and was acting headmaster at Perth school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is said his complaints about poor working conditions for teachers and his growing involvement in politics led to conflict with the education department. Joe resigned his teaching position to stand as a Labor Party candidate at the 1909 Tasmanian state election. He won a seat in the House of Assembly, representing the north-west electorate of Wilmot, and returned comfortably in 1912. He also began courting Enid Burnell in 1912. The couple married at Wynyard three years later, when Joe was 35 and Enid was almost 18 years old. At that time Joe was a minister in John Earle's Tasmanian Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor had come to power in Tasmania in 1914, on the eve of World War I, Joe was made Treasurer, Minister for Education and Minister for Railways. However, Labor lost the 1916 state election, and John Earle, a conscription supporter, resigned. Anticonscriptionist Joe Lyons took over the party leadership and became the opposition leader. Joe led the party until 1923, when he became Premier, leading a minority Labor government for the next five years. He was also Treasurer throughout his premiership, successfully reforming the powers of the conservative Tasmanian Legislative Council to reject money bills after a constitutional crisis in 1924. Labor lost the 1928 state election by a narrow margin, which proved to be a catalyst for change for the Lyons family. Joe decided to run for the federal seat of Wilmot in the 1929 election. He was elected easily and appointed Postmaster-General and Minister for Works and Railways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Great Depression hit in 1930, Joe's conservative approach was supported by the business community but opposed by many in the Labor Party. He resigned from cabinet in January 1931, and, in March, Joe and five other right-wing Labor MPs crossed the floor to sit on the opposition benches. Joe and his supporters joined members of the Nationalist Party and Australian Party and formed the new United Australia Party, the UAP. He was elected leader, thus becoming the opposition leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After successfully moving a no-confidence motion in the Scullin government, Joe led the UAP to victory in the December 1931 federal election. At the 1934 election, the UAP suffered an eight-seat swing against it, so Joe invited the Country Party, now National Party, to create a coalition and form government. The Lyons government went on to win a third term in 1937 against the John Curtin led Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While still in office, Joe died in Sydney on 7 April 1939, following a heart attack. His body lay in state at St Mary's Cathedral before being transported to Devonport for his funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes on 13 April. Less than a week later Robert Menzies won the ballot for the UAP leadership, later becoming Australia's longest-serving Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1943, Joe's widow, Enid, embarked on her own political career, representing the UAP in the Tasmanian seat of Darwin, which was later renamed Braddon. As the first woman to enter Australia's parliament, Enid Lyons is an inspiration to many women here, and I referenced her career in my first speech in this place. With a strong belief in traditional family values and conservative politics, Enid shared her husband's political views and campaigned for him. However, her involvement in community affairs and politics had begun long before she met Joe. It started via her mother's involvement with the Labor Party and continued throughout her life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born in Smithton in 1897, Enid was the second child of four for sawmill worker William Burnell and his wife, Eliza. Enid attended Burnie State School, followed by Hobart's teachers college. She returned to Burnie as a junior teacher and struck up a friendship with fellow teacher and aspiring politician Joe Lyons. Interestingly, Enid first stood for election for the state seat of Denison in 1925. The election campaign ran during a whooping cough epidemic, which affected five of the Lyons children. Enid that year came within 60 votes of becoming the first woman elected to the Tasmanian parliament. Interestingly, Margaret McIntyre took that accolade when she won Cornwall, now Rosevears, in the Legislative Council in 1948, 23 years later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Joe became the leader of the UAP and then Prime Minister in 1933, Enid embraced the public spotlight and became involved in national politics. The couple and the 11 surviving children of their 12 moved into the Lodge in Canberra. Enid spoke at political and community events, taking a stand against military conflict while stressing the importance of being prepared for war in Europe. She accompanied Joe on two official visits to England and was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1937.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Joe's death in 1939, grief-stricken, Dame Enid returned to Tasmania with her children, re-entering public life to run in the 1943 election. In her maiden speech on 29 September that year, Dame Enid spoke on social issues and the need for a postwar economic recovery plan. During her first term, she championed the extension of child endowment, free medical treatment for pensioners and the free distribution of life-saving drugs. Dame Enid increased her personal vote at two subsequent federal elections, keeping a clear focus on family values and national issues such as atomic energy, finance, population, industry, arbitration, social services, immigration and international affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 1949 Dame Enid was appointed vice-president of the executive council in Robert Menzies's cabinet. Despite this role making her the first woman in federal cabinet, Dame Enid described the position as toothless, later writing, 'They only wanted me to pour the tea.' Dame Enid resigned from federal parliament in 1951 due to ill health but resumed public life later after a time of recovery at Devonport. She served as a commissioner of the ABC for 11 years but also worked for the Australian Women's National League, the Victoria league, the Housewives Association, and St Joan's Social and Political Alliance. She was made an honorary fellow of the Australian College of Nursing in 1951 and was founding vice-president of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1954.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Extending her public reach, Dame Enid wrote three books on her life and political career as well as penning a newspaper column twice a week. On Australia Day 1983, Dame Enid Lyons was made a Dame of the Order of Australia, making her the first Australian woman to receive damehoods in two different orders. Dame Enid died the following year, aged 84, and was buried beside Joe at Devonport after a state funeral. As you can see from their story, Joe and Enid Lyons were both strong leaders. Their strong values and commitment to their family, their state and their nation were evident throughout their lives. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:01</span>):  I would like to speak about a couple of issues this evening.

Chad is married with three children and has been working as a coalminer in Central Queensland coalmines for about seven years. In that whole length of time that Chad has been working as a coalminer, he's been classed by various different companies as a 'casual' or what's known locally as a 'permanent casual', in what has to be one of the silliest phrases I've ever heard in a workplace setting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over that period of seven years, Chad has worked most of the time, pretty consistently, working the same shifts, week after week, month after month, year after year. If you looked at how often Chad has worked and the kind of work that he does, you'd actually say that he's a permanent worker. He works basically the same shifts all the time. He wears the same uniform as the permanent workers that he works with. But, because of the loophole that currently exists in our workplace laws, which this government and big mining companies have exploited, Chad is nevertheless classed as a casual worker. That means in practice that, for seven years, Chad, along with other workers like him, has not had a single day's paid sick leave and has not had a single day's annual leave. After seven years working as a permanent, he would be starting to become entitled to take some long service leave, but he doesn't get that either. He doesn't get any redundancy pay every time his work finishes and he is laid off. He doesn't get any notice any time that he's laid off from work. And, of course, he doesn't have the job security that the permanent workers he works alongside get. What that means is that he and his family have a constant level of stress about how long he is going to remain in work, how long he is going to have a pay cheque, how long he is going to be able to keep feeding his family. Because workers like Chad are not treated as permanent workers and are treated instead as casuals, they can't get home loans or car loans. It leaves them in a very insecure, precarious place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, Chad is not alone. I have met many coalminers across Central Queensland who are in exactly the same position. If we look across the country, there are thousands of coalminers now working as so-called permanent casuals. It's often said that it's okay, because people like Chad get compensated with a casual loading, and that's what covers the fact that they don't get these leave benefits and the job security that permanents get. But that's actually not true. A recent study by the McKell Institute established that many coalminers who are employed as so-called permanent casuals are in fact being paid 30 or 40 per cent less than the permanent workers they work alongside as well as missing out on the job security, leave benefits and other benefits that permanent workers get. So let's not have any of this notion that casuals are fairly compensated for the lack of security in their work. They have the double whammy of getting paid less than permanent workers and missing out on the benefits of permanent work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's such a betrayal of these workers by members of the LNP who sit in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, who are out there, day after day, saying how much they care about coalminers, dressing up like coalminers, paying visits to coalmines and telling workers there how much they care for them and how much they're working hard for them, but when they've come down to Canberra they've done nothing to fix this problem. And they have had ample time to do so, because it occurred to me that, just as Chad has worked as a so-called permanent casual coalminer for seven years, that's exactly the same length of time that the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, and the member for Dawson, George Christensen, and Senator Canavan and all of the other so-called supporters of coalminers have been sitting in the parliament and have failed to take any action to assist Chad and his fellow casual workmates. These LNP members, who say how much they like mining and say how much they like miners, have been here for every bit as long as these coalminers have been classed as casual workers, and those LNP members have done not a thing to fix the rampant casualisation and abuse of labour hire that we have seen across the mining industry in Central Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just happening in the mining industry. That's, of course, a particularly blatant example of it. It's happening in so many different industries, whether it be construction, security, cleaning or manufacturing. In fact, one of my clearest memories from the last term of parliament was a particular day where I spent the day in Rockhampton speaking with coalminers who were suffering from this exploitation and this lengthy casualisation, and that evening I returned to Brisbane to do a forum with Commonwealth public servants, and you know what the biggest complaint they had was? It was the abuse of labour hire and casualisation by this very government in terms of how it engages its own staff. So this growth of insecure work is something that is spreading right throughout the economy and throughout many, many different industries, whether it be through casual work, contract work, labour hire, gig work. These days all sorts of categories of workers are missing out on the benefits of permanent work and not being fairly compensated for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's because this has become such a big problem that last week the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, had good news for these workers, because we are clearly on the side of workers experiencing insecure employment. The best example of that was the policy that was released last week with a very simple title: Same Job, Same Pay. If you're working on a regular, systematic basis—working the same shifts week after week, month after month—like Chad and the other coalminers that I've met or the public servants that I've met or the construction workers that I've met who are going through this, if you are working on that sort of regular basis through labour hire, then you will need to be paid at least the same as the permanent workers that you work alongside. That's what a federal Labor government will do, because we're on your side. Of course there were a range of other announcements that were made by Mr Albanese in that speech as well which would also have great benefit to the vast number of people who are now experiencing insecure work, and I think that they will make a big difference to people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I wanted to touch on before my time runs out is the latest version of rorts that we have seen from a government that is truly riddled with rorts, and what I'm talking about is bushfire rorts. We've already seen from this government sports rorts. We've seen sleazy land deals. We've seen rorting of community safety funding. And now it appears that not even bushfire victims are safe from the rorting that is endemic within this government, because clear evidence has now emerged that the Morrison government is partnering with their coalition allies in the New South Wales government to shovel bushfire funds on a partisan basis towards coalition seats, or highly-marginal independent seats that are being targeted by the coalition, at the expense of Labour seats. I'll give you one example of that. Two of the worst affected areas after the Black Summer bushfires were the Blue Mountains outside Sydney and the Snowy Valleys region west of Canberra. Both experienced terrible bushfires with terrible damage and terrible losses. In fact, the National Bushfire Recovery Agency within this government paid $136,000 for a report prepared by long-term Liberal mate Peter Crone to inform decisions about which regions had suffered the most damage and which regions needed the most assistance in the form of economic recovery grants. Mr Crone's report established that both the Blue Mountains and the Snowy Valleys region experienced around a 48 per cent economic loss. On that basis, you would think that both of those regions would qualify for roughly the same amount of funding when it came to local economic recovery funds. But, no, that didn't happen. The Snowy Valleys region is based in the seat of Wagga Wagga, which was held for a long time by disgraced Liberal MP Daryl Maguire and is now marginally held by an Independent MP, but, of course, the coalition in NSW want to win it back. That seat got 12 grants, with a total value of $33 million. Just up the road is the Blue Mountains, in a seat held by the Labor party. How many grants did they get? Not one. Not a single dollar. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:11</span>):  Tonight I rise to speak on the future of the JobSeeker payment, which is due to go back to $40 a day in the very near future. In fact, in just 44 days the JobSeeker COVID supplement will end, condemning over one million people on the JobSeeker payment to live on just $40 a day. The COVID supplement, first introduced at the rate of $550 a fortnight in March last year in the face of the COVID pandemic, transformed people's lives and lifted millions out of poverty. It was the first time in decades that the unemployment payment was at a rate above the poverty line. The supplement enabled people on the JobSeeker payment, the youth allowance and the parenting payment to afford nutritious food to improve their wellbeing with three meals a day, to fund school children's activities, to buy essential medications, to pay housing costs, to buy new clothes and shoes which, for some people, would enable them to participate in interviews with confidence, and to pay for heating and cooling. By introducing the supplement at that extra rate of $550 a fortnight in March, the government finally acknowledged what everybody else knew: that trying to survive on $40 a day was simply impossible. It was impossible to survive on that amount of money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the government is now winding it back, they know that $40 a day is too low. When the government finally recognised in March that $40 a day was not enough, they knew, as I said, that $40 a day was not enough, but they couldn't stop their ideological campaign of stigmatising people who access the social security net. While thousands were accessing—and still continue to access—the social security net, for many of those people it was the first time in their lives that they'd had to do that. However, this government just cannot give up on myth making and myth spreading and attacking people on income support. They continue to air the old myths about people who are accessing income support payments and they invent excuse after excuse as to why, despite being a wealthy country, we have one of the lower unemployment payments in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the government's favourite lines, and I have heard these lines and excuses being given by a number of ministers, is the plain old propaganda line that 'the jobs are there and people just aren't looking for them; they're not trying hard enough'. The government may have an unusual take on these numbers, but the numbers show that there simply are not enough jobs. Currently, there are around 1.3 million jobseekers, but only 129,000 vacancies were advertised in January. That number is not counting the number of people currently on JobKeeper who are working no hours and may lose their job when the program ends at the end of March, a couple of days before the end of the JobSeeker payment on the 31 March. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another old favourite, and that is that an income support payment above the poverty line is a disincentive to finding work. In fact, there's clear evidence that the opposite is true. Living in poverty is a barrier to finding work. We know that people living on $40 a day cannot afford the basics and find it hard to keep a roof over their heads, let alone afford transport to get to an interview or necessary training for work. They find it hard even to afford an internet connection to apply for jobs and to participate online in the jobseeking process, which is where the government is pushing so many people. They find it hard to afford to buy suitable clothes to attend a job interview. They can't afford their medication or to go to the dentist. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour market research shows that the increased level of JobSeeker has not impacted on the rates of people seeking employment or the time it takes for employers to fill job vacancies. The so-called anecdotal evidence given by some employers has been attributed by economists to regular difficulties filling certain positions at certain times of the year and particular difficulties with skill shortages and the requirement to relocate. People's lived experience should be understood by decision-makers in government. Decision-makers should understand people's need to make sure that they meet their family commitments and their caring commitments and that they have support networks available and that they have accommodation. All these are barriers to people relocating. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, also likes to tell us that the economy is recovering, so it's time to wind back support. Well, things are improving. They are improving in some areas and for some people, but not for others. We are still living through a pandemic and will be facing this situation for quite a long time, unfortunately. The government introduced tax cuts for millionaires, but now they're refusing to properly support the more than 1.3 million people who are out of work while this pandemic and the recession continue. With the big banks ending mortgage holidays and the state based eviction moratoriums lifting, thousands of Australians are also at risk of losing the roof over their heads or finding themselves unable to pay their rental debts, which have accumulated through no fault of their own. This is coming at the same time that JobKeeper is ending and the JobSeeker payment is going back to $40 a day. I think we have a moral and ethical responsibility to support jobseekers and to ensure that they are not condemned to live in poverty but, in fact, are able to live above the poverty line. There are also significant economic benefits for our broader community through supporting jobseekers at an adequate payment level above the poverty line. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about that old line that the jobs are available, so why don't people pick fruit? Over the last couple of months I've heard that innumerable times—in fact, too many times to count. The government pushes the narrative of job snobs to further demonise people who access income support. This is casual, insecure work in areas where there's often a lack of accommodation, and support is not available for people who are moving there. This is not the way that we should be treating those people that are looking for work. It is not the way that we should be encouraging people to try to find meaningful employment. We are asking that the government raise the JobSeeker payment above the poverty line. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they want people to relocate to the bush, they need to understand people's lived experience, not demonise them, not try to browbeat them. We are asking people, entire families, to uproot their lives for short-term job prospects in an industry that has notoriously low rates of pay and higher rates of exploitation, and that continues despite, I will acknowledge, the best efforts, or efforts, I should say—not necessarily the best efforts—by government to ensure that exploitation doesn't occur. But we hear time and time again how that's occurring. Many jobseekers are unable to keep up with the costs of running a vehicle due to the low rates of income support payments, and that will be particularly the case when the payment goes back to $40 a day, making relocation to regional areas even harder, because there's a lack of rental accommodation and a lack of reliable public transport. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, we should be supporting jobseekers with more than $40 a day. Many people on the JobSeeker payment, we know, are on JobSeeker because they can't get access to the disability support pension because of the changed rules. So a high proportion, nearly 40 per cent, of those trying to survive on the JobSeeker payment are people who are sick and have a disability. That is never mentioned when the government says, 'There are all these jobs that are available out there; there are all these job snobs out there.' Well, there are not. There are people that are looking for work and need support to find work. Living on $40 a day, well below the poverty line, means going without food, going without your medication, making it more difficult to find work and putting work further and further out of reach. Increase permanently the JobSeeker rate so people aren't living in poverty.</span>

The two women and two men on our ticket, in addition to their respective careers spanning agriculture, small business, resources, communications, law, economics, military and health, just to name a few, understand what's important to everyday South Australians. They are a diverse team that was greatly advanced by the selection of my very good friend Indigenous woman Kerrynne Liddle—</span>

                  </a>  who is here, and is third on the party ticket; as well as Dr Rachel Swift, a Rhodes scholar who has worked in West Africa with the UN to combat the deadly Ebola disease. Alongside sitting senators Simon Birmingham, our very leader in this place, and Andrew McLachlan, who's in the chamber tonight—a graduate of the South Australian parliament, where he was president of the legislative council for a number of years, before he graduated to become a member of this august body, the Senate—Kerrynne and Rachel give us an amazing diversity, youth and experience, balanced against what must be the most extraordinary depth of life experience that they all are able to bring to this place. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kerrynne, as a proud Arrernte woman, has seen firsthand the disadvantage in our remote communities and is comfortable with calling out paternalism and the hypocrisy that promotes low expectations. She still has the red dirt from country Australia underneath her fingernails and has a track record of delivering outcomes. She can break a brumby, she can mules a sheep, she can scrub up to present the evening news on Channel 7 or the ABC and she can negotiate multimillion dollar deals behind land agreements. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party is a party of equal opportunity, and our Senate candidates harness the diverse experiences and business backgrounds that make that possible. We believe in the encouragement of the facilitation of wealth so that all may enjoy the highest possible standards of living, health, education and social justice. Each and every one of our candidates wants the next generation to be better placed to succeed in their lives than in their own. Our party is comprised of Australians from all walks and at all stages of life. Fighting for South Australia requires individuals who are prepared to stand up to our bigger state cousins and prepared to stand up for the investment our state needs, sometimes against a national trend. </span>

                  </a>  With real-world experience, the South Australia Senate ticket is a strong team who will advance South Australia's interests at the next federal election. They share a vision for South Australia, one where we can attract more investment to ensure that the jobs stay in our state, both in Adelaide and across all of our regions, to help keep our children working and living in South Australia. </span>

I look forward to working with Simon Birmingham, with Andrew McLachlan, with Kerrynne, with Rachael Swift, with David Fawcett and with Alex Antic to make sure that we do re-elect a Morrison-McCormack government because we know that Australia relies on us to deliver the right government to make sure that our society and our economy go forward in leaps and bounds, and we will work tirelessly to make sure that we secure the greatest number of Liberals to represent our state. </span>

Ashton Hurn, who was preselected in the seat of Schubert and who has worked for me, I am very proud to say, is the most outstanding a young woman and will make an incredible contribution to South Australia.</span>

                  </a>  She is an extraordinary young lady. Senator Farrell opposite, with his interjections, would do well to watch her progress because, I can assure you, you will see Ashton Hurn become a great, great South Australian politician. She will make sure she supports the continuation of a Liberal government in South Australia to make sure your team don't get their hands on the treasury benches and cause the kind of devastation they did last time they had control. The other person preselected on the weekend was Amy Williams, for the seat of Mawson. Amy comes from the country, she has a great dairy-farming background and she is no stranger to agri-politics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between those two wonderful young women and the great team that Steven Marshall has already formed around him, and others who will hopefully be preselected over the coming weeks to fill the team vacancies in South Australia, we will be able to deliver the great diversity that Australia and South Australia need to make sure that we continue to govern this country for the best outcomes for all of the citizens of Australia and South Australia. I'm very proud to be here tonight to tell you about the amazing people that the South Australian Liberal Party is putting in our parliaments both here in Canberra and in South Australia—</span>
