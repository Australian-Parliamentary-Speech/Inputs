              <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Capital Authority is seeking approval for proposed works within the Parliamentary Zone being a commemoration of Sir John McEwen, Australia's 18th Prime Minister. A cast bronze full body statue of Sir John serves as a focal feature within a commemorative pavement which represents the various services and industries of rural and regional Australia. Sir John, best known as 'Blackjack', is portrayed standing over two bags of wheat, which are representative of his longstanding contribution to Australia's trade efforts and also to rural and regional Australians. Adjacent to the works will be a metal sign with interpretive material describing the purpose of the works. The project has been developed by the National Capital Authority in close collaboration with the National Party of Australia. Approval of both houses is sought under section 5(1) of the Parliament Act 1974 for the proposed works in the Parliamentary Zone. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements three main measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the bill amends a number of foundational medical device definitions to support the closer alignment of the regulation of medical devices in Australia with the EU framework and more broadly the global regulation of medical devices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the bill ensures that the definition of 'medical device' expressly covers software, implants and reagents. This reduces uncertainty around the definition of medical devices as those intended to be used for the prediction or prognosis of disease; the investigation, replacement or modification of a pathological process or state; the support of conception and the in-vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body for a specific medical purpose. The bill also brings the 'accessory' and 'system or procedure pack' definitions more into line with the EU terms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are designed to assist efforts to improve access for Australian consumers to new medical devices by identifying Australia as a market that is closely aligned with the EU and for which access may be sought by device manufacturers and sponsors without delay, following EU approvals of their products. They also support recommendation 20 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Expert </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Panel's R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview of medicines and medical devices regulation</span>, agreed to by the Australian government in its response to the review in September 2016, in relation to aligning the regulation of medical devices in Australia with the EU wherever possible. These changes improve the clarity of these definitions which, in turn, supports better regulatory compliance for industry sponsors and manufacturers of medical devices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill enables the secretary to provide scientific advice to an applicant about prescription and over-the-counter medicines before they submit a formal application to the TGA for marketing approval. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some instances, it can be difficult for sponsors of medicines to determine the nature of information needed to support an application for registration, particularly in relation to whether a bioequivalence study is needed for a generic prescription medicine or what is required to justify not submitting a bioequivalence study. This uncertainty may risk sponsors investing considerable time and resources on evidence that is not needed or providing insufficient evidence, resulting in applications being rejected. Both instances may delay consumer access to new medicines and savings to the public through availability of generic brands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To better support the timely availability of medicines for Australians, the bill allows the applicant to request non-binding, scientific advice on prescribed aspects of the safety, quality or efficacy of a registrable medicine. While it is anticipated that initially this will focus on bioequivalence issues, the new power would allow a range of matters relevant to safety, quality or efficacy to be prescribed in the regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The advice will be non-binding in that an applicant who requests such advice may apply for registration of a medicine regardless of the advice given in relation to the medicine. However, the TGA will be required to have regard to such advice when evaluating a medicine for registration. This will ensure that, in addition to helping medicine sponsors have greater confidence about the requirements for an application, the advice will also directly support and streamline any subsequent application for registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill introduces a data protection regime for assessed listed medicines—these are lower risk complementary medicines that are assessed in relation to their efficacy claims before they are given marketing approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This regime is based on the existing data protection regime in the Therapeutic Goods Act for innovator prescription medicines, and provides five years' protection for clinical trial information that a sponsor submits in support of an indication (that is, a health condition) for an assessed listed medicine. This will be in cases where the information is not currently publicly available and no other medicine has that indication at the time the application for listing is made. This will mean that a sponsor of another assessed listed medicine will not be able to utilise the same information in the evaluation of its own medicine during that five-year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure is designed to provide an incentive for sponsors of assessed listed medicines to invest in clinical trials research and innovation and, in so doing, to improve the competitiveness of the Australian complementary medicines industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains a number of other, minor measures, to reduce regulatory burden, improve the consistency of regulatory requirements or make other minor changes to remove spent and redundant provisions, correct headings and codify a longstanding condition of marketing approval for registered and listed therapeutic goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These include changes to:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">remove an unintended barrier to the operation of the provisional registration pathway for promising new medicines, by ensuring that where sponsors of these medicines need to vary certain aspects of their products while they are provisionally registered—such as dosage form or strength—they may apply for marketing approval for such versions without having to go back to the start of the pathway;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">allow sponsors of clinical trials that are approved by the secretary to request variations to their approvals—currently trial sponsors cannot make such requests and would have to make a fresh application for a new trial, even for minor variations; and</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:46</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2019-2020, which provide appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of the government for the remainder of 2019-20. I do so within the context of how our country is dealing with the coronavirus, what we've seen around the world and what I think we're about to see in this country. Mr Speaker, you were here when I spoke about this during the adjournment debate on Monday night. I make these comments in the spirit of bipartisanship, but I want to draw attention to what I think are some constructive suggestions that might improve our response to this particular outbreak. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll start where I left off on Monday night. I believe that, with respect to the best way of dealing with not just this outbreak but future outbreaks, our country would be best served by an Australian centre for disease control. That, in my mind, would be the best way of providing an enduring and a coordinated approach to major health outbreaks like the coronavirus. In light of what we've seen recently in the public debate, as an individual, I'm calling for the establishment of an Australian centre for disease control and prevention as a vehicle for preventing misinformation or conflicting information emerging in the Australian community. However well intentioned our efforts have been and continue to be—and I commend the government and the opposition for their efforts—in this era of fake news, this is something that we need to look at and continue to address as the best way forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe, and overseas experience shows, that a centre for disease control and prevention would be a useful coordinating agency that would harmonise the provision of information on, for example, the coronavirus between the Australian government and the respective state and territory governments. In times of crisis, we need to ensure that the Australian public has the best available information at their disposal when they need it. Australians want to know, for example, about our quarantine and isolation arrangements. They want to know how fast the virus is spreading, they want to know how many people have contracted the virus in Australia, and they want to know what to do if the virus spreads in Australia. An established centre for disease control and prevention in Australia would, in my view, be able to coordinate our nation's response in answering all of these questions not just now but on an ongoing basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this outbreak, we're starting to see that the lessons of SARS, swine flu and the 2014 Ebola outbreak have not been learned by governments. I've seen it described by immunologists as a panic-and-then-forget response. We can't afford to panic and then forget this time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said on Monday night, we live in an age of disinformation and fake news. More than ever we need to find a way to cut through this noise. I hope we consider establishing a properly funded Australian CDC to coordinate and disseminate vital public health messages for the sake of our community and our frontline and vital healthcare workers who need to keep us safe. Additionally, no specific antiviral treatments presently exist to deal with this virus. On the best possible medical advice that I've been provided with at this point in time, a vaccination could be at least a year away—that's not to mention how long it would take for large-scale production of that vaccine to proceed. That emphasises that we have to have a centre that is committed to ongoing and enduring funded research that addresses developing treatments that reduce mortality and outbreaks. As I said, research in this needs to be enduring and focused, not just reactive. That's not to diminish the work that some of our fine institutions do, but I do believe that we need to be more focused in how we address this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know with SARS and MERS, most of the serious cases of this virus develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. To quote a recent paper in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> 'There is an urgent need for focused funding and scientific investments into advancing novel therapeutic interventions for coronavirus infections.' Let us listen to this advice and support those carrying out this essential research on an enduring basis. I'll give an example of why we need to do this. A paper released a week or so ago by six epidemiologists based in Canada—in my last speech I said it was Canberra, but it was Canada—using mathematical modelling and taking into account the number of exported cases has estimated the present case count of the coronavirus in Iran is about 18,000 people. I actually believe it's more than that. I have heard there are tens of thousands. This is in comparison to the 593 cases in Iran that the World Health Organization publicly reported only a couple of days ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said on Monday, a co-author of the paper, infectious disease specialist Isaac Bogoch, commented, 'When a country exports cases to other destinations it's very likely that the burden of infection in this country is significant.' We have experienced that as a consequence of the underreporting of the virus in Iran and people returning from Iran. We're rushing to plug the gap, so to speak. That's why we need to have clearer information on an ongoing basis about how viruses of this type spread.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, it is clear we must do even more to contain the spread of the virus and to address what is clearly going to be—and I suspect we'll see this through the national accounts that will come down at 11.30 this morning—the economic damage this virus is creating. According to the ABC on Monday, the ASX 200 was down about 10.5 per cent last week, meaning that we lost about $240 billion on the local stock market. That was last week. The plummeting stock market, which is seeing a slight correction, is I think just the tip of the iceberg. Small businesses that rely on overseas production are suffering. Australian exporters are losing access to valuable overseas markets, and tourism is clearly sharply down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supply chain disruptions, due to halting production in China and elsewhere, will ripple throughout the economy for months, perhaps even years, especially in critical industries like construction and manufacturing. According to Senator Elizabeth Warren, the coronavirus has exposed a critical weakness in our drug supply chain, for example. A significant proportion of pharmaceutical ingredients for drugs are manufactured in China, which means supply chain disruption may eventually cause drug shortages around the world, including in Australia. Analysts now project that many American and Australian companies will generate zero earnings growth in 2020 because of the coronavirus. If the coronavirus—I guess we could say 'when'—reaches global pandemic levels, experts predict that it could lead to a recession in Australia and across the globe. In response to the coronavirus, I'd encourage the Australian government as an example to work with employers to assist people with providing potentially an emergency paid sick leave for people either suffering from the coronavirus or who need to remain isolated if they have a relative who may have contracted coronavirus. Like I said, this will ripple across our country for some period of time. If you're a casual worker who might need to take 14 days off, as a colleague of mine, the member for Werriwa, mentioned to me yesterday, what does it mean for the person who is forced to take 14 days off? Where is the protection for that person, that casual worker? That might be a mum working in Narre Warren South or in Cranbourne who will need to take the mandated 14 days off because that person has the coronavirus, but where is her employment protection? Where is her wage protection?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things that we're having to grapple with and we're going to have to grapple with them very rapidly, because, as part of the best possible advice, which we have taken from our Chief Medical Officer and the experts, we are requiring isolation. We're going to have to isolate people who are contracting this particular virus or who have contracted the virus, and we need to think about it. The ripple effects of this virus through our economy are going to be and continue to be substantial not just in mortality rate, not just in populations that are at greater risk—and we've had a discussion about that, and that has been in the media—but your normal mum and dad that live in the outer suburbs of electorates like mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I encourage the Australian government to strongly consider a stimulus package to support the Australian economy. As a starting point, I think the stimulus package should focus on low- to no-interest loans to companies of all sizes negatively affected by supply chain disruptions, reductions to tourism or other temporary coronavirus related impacts. In my view, restoring confidence will be the key. We need calm, strong, focused leadership in addressing this issue. The Australian people need it. Our government needs to deliver it. Our parliament needs to deliver it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the dust settles we also need to consider contemplating the effect our impact on the environment is having on the current and future spread of infectious disease. The dilution effect is a concept that has been around for some time. Basically, the theory is that healthy biodiversity can be a protection against infection of humans by zoonotic pathogens such as in the case of Lyme disease in the United States. Climate change is expected to impact the spread of infectious diseases and the animals that carry them. In Australia, for example, research has shown that dengue fever and other arboviruses spread primarily by a particular mosquito are likely to significantly extend the period of time during the year when transmission of the disease is possible. In Far North Australia there are predictions that disease transmission could be possible for 12 months of the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we need to fully commit to the Paris Agreement, invest in the Green Climate Fund and continue to fund the Global Health Security Agenda to work in partnership with the now other 67 countries to strengthen their public health infrastructure and combat outbreaks before they start. As mentioned, we also need a centre for disease control and prevention. We should also join peer countries and invest in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a public global alliance focused on vaccine development, and actively participate in global coalitions working towards vaccine development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I give this speech at a time when we're seeing our supermarkets raided for toilet paper and other essentials: hand sanitiser and other things. I think it would be safe to say in this place that there is some significant level of concern in the Australian community. But the point I would make to the Australian people is also that this parliament—both sides, including the Independents—is resolutely committed on a bipartisan, tripartisan or whatever you want to call the level to ensure that we deal with this threat. I think the difficulty is that a lot of Australian people see this parliament through the prism of question time. And I know the member for Ballarat, who was an excellent advocate in the health space when she was shadow minister for health, will know what I'm saying. People see us addressing collectively a crisis through the prism of what they might see on their local news, which focuses on the issue of the day. For them, sometimes they need information around that blizzard of information that they see—the theatrics that happen in question time. They don't see what's happening on a bipartisan basis, with all levels of government and the opposition working together to come to a conclusion, which I believe leads to a misapprehension that all of us in this place are not committed to doing something to address this very serious issue. I want to take this opportunity to say to the people listening that that is not the case. This House, regardless of what you might see—and the Senate, even though it's in estimates—is consumed by this particular problem and wants to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure that we can address this issue. Do not underestimate, even through the static of what you might see on social media or through some of the misinformation that's being spread, that all of us—it doesn't matter whether it's the people over there or here—are committed to ensuring that we protect our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This coronavirus outbreak is a matter of national security. It's the security of our people. On matters of national security, this place has a great track record of working on a bipartisan basis to ensure that we deliver to the Australian people that sense of security that they need. That's what I believe will happen in this case. I inevitably think that the government will have to move to a stimulus package. There is no alternative. We've seen the reserve bank in the United States yesterday or last night cut interest rates by 0.5 per cent—I could stand to be corrected on that. Overseas there is clearly an understanding, even with an American economy that seemed to be travelling pretty well. Like with the American economy, this virus is going to have a substantial impact on the global economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, again, through the static, through the noise, through the misinformation campaigns that will be run inevitably—you can see that through various manifestations that are occurring, whether it be a particular stereotyping of a particular ethnic grouping or whatever—the fact is that we will cut through the noise. It's our job to deliver health security to the Australian people. As I say to the Australian people, we do what we can in this place on a bipartisan level to deliver that outcome to the Australian people. Regardless of what they may see, regardless of what they may believe and regardless of what they hear, that's what we're here for. I believe that all of us in this place will be doing that job on behalf of the Australian people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020, which seeks to effectively provide top-up funding to the 2019-20 budget. A quick look at the schedule of appropriations shows the usual areas receiving the lion's share of spending. The portfolio of Home Affairs receives the largest top-up, with an allocation of just under $1 billion. Next is the portfolio of Social Services, on just under $900 million, where I am pleased to see that the National Disability Insurance Scheme has been allocated a further $5 million. Then, predictably, the portfolio of Defence sits with an additional $533 million, the bulk of which goes directly to the department but a small percentage does go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which I wholeheartedly support. Then there's the usual scattering of funds to other portfolios, and it is one of those that I wish to focus my comments on with respect to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the $183 million in funds allocated to the portfolio of Health an amount of $125,000 only has been allocated to the Australian Sports Commission. This is on top of the $388 million allocated in the 2019-20 budget. It's on this that I wish to shine a spotlight today—because, as the shameful sports rorts scandal was emerging and the unfolding revelations of the misappropriated funds were being detailed, another saga was bubbling along with the Australian Sports Commission. In a series of media reports, revelations were made about the spending patterns of the commission and particularly spending for the Australian Institute of Sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games sports are facing huge funding cuts, some of more than 60 per cent. For instance, the Australian women's hockey team, the Hockeyroos, once the pride of the nation, have had their future funding slashed by 60 per cent. Other sports to lose funding include synchronised swimming, softball, gymnastics, taekwondo, diving, football, basketball, archery, modern pentathlon, volleyball and water polo. The funding cuts will mean some of those sports will lose their elite sports programs and will not be in a position to hire the much-needed coaching staff to stay competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Individual sporting bodies were allegedly told in February how much funding they would receive for just the first six months after the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games, with some additional funding being used to reward the sports that do well. So not only do they get their funding cut but also, if they fail to perform, they will face further cuts. As you can imagine, this puts an enormous amount of pressure on the individual athletes that are competing in the upcoming games in Tokyo, knowing that their performance, their individual result, will impact on the future funding of their chosen sports and the next generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been widespread criticism and dismay that future funding won't even be maintained at the bare basics that it sits at today for many sports, and an entire generation of athletes will be negatively impacted. Many have concluded that the biggest losers will be the Australian youth, currently aged between 13 and 16, who would be eyeing a shot at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. They simply won't have access to the programs or the coaching that would enable them to reach their potential. At a time when we should be fostering sport in our youth, encouraging them to have big dreams and goals, encouraging them to pursue sporting careers and helping them pursue their dreams, cost-cutting and defunding will mean that certain opportunities are lost. It's at this age that proper support, financial or otherwise, can make all the difference to an athlete and whether they choose to pursue their sporting career or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst serious questions were being asked about the defunding of individual sports, revelations were also being made about where some of those funds were actually being spent: $8 million on executive training for high-ranking officials at the Australian Sports Commission; $5 million on recruitment consultants; $17 million in marketing and advertising; $2 million to lease offices in Brisbane and Melbourne; and an estimated travel figure of $3 million for AIS executives who prefer to fly in and out of Canberra for work rather than being Canberra based. As pointed out in the media, that last figure of $3 million is close to the amount needed to fund an entire sport, such as water polo, whose budget is $3.89 million a year; surfing, $2.73 million a year; or softball, $2.26 million a year. I think we really need to understand and ask why such a high proportion of the funds is being spent on travel expenses for AIS executives. Meanwhile, struggling athletes are relying on families and friends to pursue their dreams. They are doing GoFundMe pages, they are doing raffles and they are doing everything they can within their community to put together the funds. I can absolutely relate to that. As a past Olympic athlete, I remember having to fundraise and have the support of my family to afford to take my skis to the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics because the funding we received didn't cover the excess luggage that I had to pay to take my equipment to the Olympics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example: the national baseball team, ranked No. 6 in the world, has been told it will not get any money for an upcoming Olympic qualifying camp because it is not considered good enough to win an Olympic gold medal. Similarly, the under-20 athletes taking part in the world championships in Kenya in July will have to pay $4,000 for the right to represent Australia. The reality is that we are creating a situation where fulfilling one's sporting dreams and aspirations is only for those who can afford to do it. We are losing the talent and crushing the dreams of so many that aren't in a position to afford to pay for it. Which of our past sporting heroes would we have lost under that approach? Would it have been Cathy Freeman, Ian Thorpe or Mick Fanning? Sport has always played a huge part in the Australian cultural identity. Which one of our Australian heroes that we celebrate would we give up and say, 'Sorry, but funding your sport is not a priority'? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This current financial mess and uncertainty could obviously jeopardise our success and our prospects at the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games in July and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022, and also our success or otherwise beyond those Games for the dreams and aspirations of all our young people that are thinking about what their dreams might be now. MPs will recall that Australia used to be the envy of the world when it came to our sporting success. We would often say that we were punching above our weight, as the saying goes. Other nations used to look at us and wonder what our secret was. At the Sydney 2000 Games we ranked fourth in the world on the overall medal tally. That's an incredible result for a country of our size. At those games we got 16 gold, 25 silver and 17 bronze—a total of 58 medals. Our tally has gradually been decreasing at every games since. By London in 2012 we had slipped to eighth position with 35 medals, and by Rio we slipped again, with 29 medals. For each of those Olympic years funding continued to be the issue. Sports simply cannot stay competitive if funding is not there for the coaching and the elite level programs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not just about medal tallies or Australia's love of sport or our desire to do our best or be the best. It is about shaping a culture, creating role models and keeping our community, particularly young people, fit and healthy. The benefits of playing sports are well known: lower obesity rates, better overall health, improved mental health and greater social cohesion. The ripple effects of sport on general health and wellbeing of individuals and of a nation are widespread. The benefits are in jeopardy if we start undermining the way we view and fund our national sports program, especially Olympic sports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about our national identity, our health as a nation and where our priorities lie. What do we aspire to be? Who will be the role models for our kids and grandkids if we don't support our young Australians getting to the Olympics and having a chance of being competitive at those Olympics? I have been a director of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia, which takes care of our winter programs for the winter Olympic Games. I know firsthand the challenges of funding. It is a constant struggle, and it's always the families and athletes that are called upon to contribute. Winter sports in particular are consistently disadvantaged in funding in Australia. But our national sporting authority must do better. I call on the Commonwealth government to reassess the funding process, to review the governance in general of the Australian Sports Commission and to support our aspiring athletes. We must be able to have role models, and our youth need to have those dreams.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  When I'm back in the electorate, I'm quite concerned at the number of people who are getting quite depressed or even feeling some despair about the direction the country is going under this Morrison government. Their concerns range from a lack of action on climate change and a concern for the young children and what their lives might be like to an apparent complete unwillingness by this government to seize any of the opportunities in the world that will see our country flourish, and the punitive behaviour when it comes to the most vulnerable people in our society. I want to talk a bit today about what I see when I come here, which is the extraordinary lack of leadership from the Morrison government. It's not just the Morrison government. Those opposite have been in government for seven years now. You can trace it back through Prime Minister Abbott, Prime Minister Turnbull and now Prime Minister Morrison's extraordinary lack of action on anything that would cause this country to grow or flourish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the old industrial management models, there was a theory about the way that a big industrial company grew and flourished and then eventually died as the capital assets came to the end of their life. When I have come into this parliament and watched this government over the last seven years, it's almost as if they have been following that path. In the early stages of these companies, you get what is known as a space cadet, who comes up with the idea, and then the operations people come in and make it all work. When it's working well, the administration phase comes in, where people make it more efficient, to get the last bit of profit out of it. Eventually, it becomes the cash cow that funds new activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the modern world, companies need to reinvent themselves all the time, but this government is in this really old mode. What we've seen over the past seven years is a government not managing the country or managing the economy but sending in the administration teams, effectively to squeeze the last little bit out of it. You can see that through its targeting of people on unemployment benefits who might be on drugs and its drug testing of dole recipients; the cashless welfare cards; trying to cut the pension and talking about expanding the cashless welfare card right across pensions as well; and robodebts—sending out debt notices for debts that weren't owed. Whatever they can do that squeezes that last little bit of cash out of the most vulnerable people they will do. The other side of that is their making sure that they get what they need, that their supporters, their sponsors and they get what they need, taking what they can out of the economy and out of the government for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We come in here, week after week after week and we look at lists of bills that are at best administrative; they don't do anything that causes the country to grow. They are essentially bills that government departments have put together because they see something that wasn't quite right about something that was introduced a couple of years ago. They are small administrative bills, essentially put forward by government departments. We've seen them come in one after the other. Sometimes you can be in this House for a week and there are no speakers on the government side at all, because the bills are of no interest to them because they are simply administrative bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't recall in the past seven years of this shockingly do-nothing government any bills whatsoever that actually enabled, empowered or enriched our population, that caused our economy to grow and flourish or that put to work the extraordinary capacity of Australians to think. We are one of the great creative nations in the world. In every field where creativity matters we punch above our weight, yet from this government there's nothing. There is nothing there. Even when they do say they are going to do something they take forever to do it. So the first point I want to make, really, is that this government is in the wrong phase for a country like Australia and the situation we're in. We're in a world filled with opportunities, and we have a government that thinks that the way things are is the way they should stay, and they will simply administer the government into the most efficient, punitive style they can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was studying cross-cultural management, nearly 40 years ago, we studied a book written by a man named Sunzi. It was called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Art of War</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Bingfa</span>. Back in those days it was largely unknown. I was very lucky to have a PhD guy who was studying that particular management text for his PhD. I spent a lot of time finding translations of it because they were very hard to find. I had about six translations of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunz</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">The Art of War</span>. It was a text that in those days was studied by every management school through China, Japan and most of Asia, but was largely unknown in the West. When the West did discover it they thought it was, essentially, machiavellian, but it actually isn't. The single management theory and strategic theory of bingfa, which comes through over and over and over again, is that if you're really a good leader, if you're really a good general, no-one will have heard of you because you will have prevented the war. If you're a really good doctor your patients don't get sick. If you're a really good manager the crisis does not occur. So if you're known for solving a crisis you are a bad leader, not a good one, because a good leader sees off the crisis before it takes place. I have lived with that theory and I look for that in my staff. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should look for that in our government, but this government is the opposite of that. This Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government does not act on anything until the crisis is so great that every single person in the country knows about it, and then they decide to make an announcement and maybe do something—but the announcement is usually greater than the action. This is a government that never acts to stop a crisis until the crisis is so great that everybody knows about it. We saw that with the bushfires, even though every expert on climate change has told us this was coming—the Ross Garnaut report said that we'd be looking at exactly this by 2020. But this government, even when the fires were raging, did not act until the country was screaming for action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That could be for one of two reasons. It could be that the spin merchants in the government have extended what we all know they do anyway, which is that, before you announce a solution, you make sure as many people as possible know about the problem. If you're going to announce a road in your electorate, you go out and tell everyone of this terrible problem so that when the announcement is made you get more credit for it. That's called spin. We know that happens, usually over a couple of months, and we can watch them do it. I say to anybody out there, if your member of parliament is getting up and saying, 'Look, this is terrible,' particularly if they're on the government side, then you can bet that in a few months they're going to come to you with an answer that has already been approved—probably through a rort or a program that hasn't been announced: who knows? But you can bet that's the case. So it could be that this government thinks: 'Let's wait till everybody knows about the crisis in aged care before we do anything about it. Let's wait till everybody knows that we've lost 180,000 apprentices in the last year. Let's wait till everybody knows before we act.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I don't think that is the case. And this is the other of the two reasons. I think this is a government that doesn't actually recognise the role of government and doesn't act early because it doesn't know how. You can go back, right through the Abbott years and the Turnbull years and now the Morrison years, and you can see it has happened time after time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An absolute example of that is the home-care and aged-care situation at the moment. The government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to a royal commission on aged care, and now we have story after story. One in two people in aged-care facilities are malnourished—literally starving. People are waiting three years for home-care packages. It's truly extraordinary. People in aged-care facilities are lying in urine and faeces. They're appalling stories that we've known about for ages. In fact, a lot of the breaches of regulations were well known to the regulator. These stories have been out there for at least the last seven years, for at least the entire term of this conservative government, yet it has not acted. Finally, they called a royal commission into aged care. The royal commission found the situation so appalling that they've released an interim report, which is rarely done, and the government is still waiting for the final outcome before it acts. If this story were headline news every night, they would be acting. But they're waiting. They're waiting until the crisis is so bad that they simply cannot ignore it anymore. It's truly astonishing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the same for dental services in aged care. Many older Australians are entitled to dental services in the public system, and we know that one in two senior Australians have gum disease. One in five have no natural teeth. We know that, yet older Australians are forced to wait months or years for public dental care. The government have cut public dental funding by hundreds of millions of dollars and they're going to axe it completely in July. How bad does this actually have to get before the government think they should act? Just how bad does it have to get?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see it with the royal commission into banking and financial services; it's the same story. We had to drag them kicking and screaming to that. Even though the stories of bad behaviour by banks were out there, and people knew, this government sat on its hands. In fact, we spent 600 days trying to convince Malcolm Turnbull to call for a royal commission into banking, and finally he did. The royal commission's damning report came out in February last year—2019. There were 76 recommendations, but again the government hardly touched them. There are a few now that they are starting to work their way through, but there are none before the parliament. Again, how bad does it have to get before this government thinks it should lead? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about recycling. The government have just discovered that technology might be the answer to climate change! It has been the answer for decades, yet we've seen cuts to the CSIRO, attempts to wind back the funding for ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, attempts to pull the funding out of innovation, and cuts to R&amp;D. Now that everybody in the country finally knows, because of the bushfires, that climate change is real, the government are prepared to make a few announcements and take some minor actions—but only minor ones. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now they've realised everybody cares about plastic in the ocean, they're finally prepared to talk about that. We are still waiting for what the actual action will be. But it has been a crisis for decades. Everybody in this country should have known that our recycling was an issue. Everybody should have known. In fact, China stopped importing our recyclables in 2018. There are 24 types of recyclable materials which China will no longer import. That was January 2018—two years ago. In 2019, COAG met and they made some pleasant announcements about things they might do—and, now, a year later, there's still nothing. It's as if they sit on the problem and ignore it until everybody knows about it and their hand is forced and then they try to take credit for acting on it. It is extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These plastics and recyclable materials are commodities. They're actually inputs. The opportunities for Australia to use its ingenuity and imagination to build industries in this sector have been there for a decade or more; yet we've had a government that not only has not been doing anything but also has been actively undermining it by reducing funding for the very organisations and institutions that would drive change. We know that there are 9.2 jobs for every 10,000 tonnes recycled in Australia, compared to 2.8 for export. Yet, when the crisis finally hit and when China withdrew two years ago—and we knew they were going to; we knew it wasn't going to last—the government didn't think the problem was bad enough to act. What an extraordinary indictment on this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we can talk about the economy. Finally, we've got a government that's talking about a stimulus package to respond to the coronavirus and the difficulties that small businesses are having. But the economy has been underperforming for six years or more. The economic indicators that are reported now for the Australian economy are all bad. They're all worse than they were when this government got elected. Economic growth has slowed since the election. Underemployment is high, with two million Australians looking for work or for more work. Weak wages growth has slowed even further. The Liberals are presiding over the worst wages growth on record, and wages are growing at one-fifth the pace of profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank cut interest rates again yesterday. They're lower than they were in the global financial crisis, which was the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And for most of the period of this government's term, over the last seven years, the global economy was growing—and we weren't. We were going backwards while the rest of the world actually grew. Household spending is growing at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis. Household debt is around record levels of disposable income, and consumer confidence is below average. Household living standards have declined under the Liberals, with real household median income lower than it was in 2013. Now, finally, the government has decided to do something—but there's no detail. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span>.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  We are at risk of heading towards a recession. We've got wages flatlining. The climate crisis is hitting agriculture and tourism, with communities still trying to recover from the devastating bushfires we've seen. We've got sluggish manufacturing and construction. And the Reserve Bank is now doing everything it can, but it is running out of bullets. We are heading towards a cliff, but the Prime Minister is refusing to grab the steering wheel. It is his assumption that everything will be okay, but everything is not okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are confronting a coronavirus, which is coming at us like a freight train; the climate crisis; an inequality crisis; and a jobs crisis. Finally the Prime Minister has acknowledged that there might be some need to stimulate the economy and, in his words, 'ensure some cash flow'. So the question is: if we're to avoid recession and we're to deal with the inequality crisis that is gripping us with inequality at a seven-year high, what is the best way to tackle the inequality crisis and ensure Australia does not head towards recession as the Prime Minister refuses to put his hands on the wheel?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He's spoken about cash flow. The best way to get more money moving in the economy is to provide it to those at the bottom who are living below the poverty line, because they are going to go and spend it on essentials like food. And that, in turn, is going to help people like our farmers who are going to grow that food. We have a situation at the moment where people who are looking for work—because the government hasn't created enough jobs in the economy for them to take—are living below the poverty line. Not only that, you could in fact be a full-time worker in this country and the minimum wage is so low that you could be below the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's think about those people who are on Newstart and youth allowance. They are getting by on a very, very small amount of money that is below the poverty line and is, in fact, a barrier to finding work. We need to lift Newstart and youth allowance by at least $95 a week. It has not been lifted for years and, as a result, it is a barrier to people finding jobs and people are doing it tough. This is a golden opportunity to both stimulate the economy and lift people out of poverty by lifting Newstart and youth allowance by at least $95 a week, because that money is going to be spent on essentials. There's some talk from the government about 'Maybe we'll offer tax cuts to people who are already well-off.' A lot of that is going to go to pay down the record debt that people are in because housing is so expensive and mortgages are so high. But if you want to ensure that the money is going to find its way back into the economy, then let's lift Newstart and let's lift youth allowance, because we will be tackling inequality, lifting people out of poverty and stimulating the economy, and that is what the Green New Deal is about. It is about tackling the crises that this country is facing, avoiding recession and stimulating the economy while making sure that we close the inequality gap in this country that is at a seven-year high. So, if the Prime Minister wants to take action with the economic crises that we're facing and the inequality crises that we're facing, he should lift Newstart and youth allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a wealthy country like Australia, no-one should go without a home, but we have an affordability crisis in this country. We have homelessness rising. In my area of Victoria, there are 82,000 people on the waiting list trying to get into public housing. I have spoken to pregnant women who, at the moment, are living in crisis accommodation and are likely to be in crisis accommodation when they have their babies because there is no vacancy on the public housing waiting list for them. Just imagine that. Imagine you are pregnant and you know that you're going to have your baby in a couple of months and you don't have a place to live. That is where we are at in modern-day, wealthy Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, this government keeps locking young people out of the housing market by providing billions of dollars in subsidies to people who've already got two, three, four homes to go and buy their fifth or sixth. That not only is a drain on the public purse but keeps bumping up the prices of housing so that young people who think they might be in with a chance of buying a house go along to auctions and keep getting outbid by someone who's already got a couple of houses. That person who's got a couple of houses knows that, if they buy that house, no matter how much it costs, they can write off their losses as a tax break, and screw the young person who gets outbid because they don't have that government largesse in the form of tax breaks subsidising them. That is the crazy situation we have at the moment. We have that situation because we no longer treat affordable housing as a human right. We treat it as an investment class where the government rewards their big donors but young people get locked out of the housing market.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's for buying, but it's increasingly the same for renting as well. If you are a young person on youth allowance trying to rent at the moment, or if you're in one of those jobs—we have a jobs crisis in this country because nearly one in three young people is either unemployed or doesn't have enough hours of work. They're stuck in low-hour, insecure work. It is hard now even to rent a house and, if the only income that you've got is Newstart or youth allowance, almost zero properties are available for you in CBD areas in some of our major capital cities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing in Australia is cooked. It is seriously messed up. We have lost sight of the basic fact that housing needs to be treated as a human right. If we turned 82,000 people in the state of Victoria away from public schools because there weren't enough places at the schools, there would be an outcry. But we're turning away from public housing 82,000 people who need it—by definition these are the people who need it—because there have not been enough new public housing units built.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a construction led recovery in the economy that also tackles the housing, homelessness and affordability crisis. And that is why the Greens have been pushing, as part of the Green New Deal, for a massive new public and affordable housing build to address the homelessness crisis; to start creating jobs in the construction sector, including for our apprentices; and to start stimulating the economy. This is what the Green New Deal is about. It's about saying we can solve the housing crisis that we've got, we can start solving the inequality and the jobs crises that we've got and we can start to stimulate the economy while tackling homelessness. We can do all of those things if government is prepared to put its hands back on the steering wheel. At the moment, leaving everything to the market, with government inflating the prices and government giving subsidies to people who don't need it, because they've already got three, four or five houses, is fuelling inequality in this country. It means we in this country don't spend our money on productive investments. It means a lot of the money from banks goes off to subsidise housing and big mortgages so that banks keep getting fat off it, because they get to write huge mortgages. The price of housing keeps going up and up, and everyone who has already got three or four houses already loves that, because then they can sell a house and make a bit of money. But everyone else gets locked out and screwed over, and that is what we need to fix with the Green New Deal.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that perplexes most people in this country is why you can't use your Medicare card to go to the dentist. Why is it that, if you get a soccer ball to the face on the weekend and it busts your jaw, you can use your Medicare card to get it fixed, but, if it busts your teeth, you can't? That is the ridiculous situation that we're in at the moment. We need to get dental into Medicare. Too many people are putting off going to the dentist because they can't afford it. That's not only bad for their teeth; it's also bad for their health in the longer term because, if you don't get your teeth fixed, it can lead to other kinds of diseases simply because the diseases get in through the mouth. That's not only bad because people end up being less healthy and have bad teeth; if the only thing you cared about was the economics of it, it's bad for the federal budget as well because those people end up having to go see the doctor or having to go to hospital because of something that was ultimately preventable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also a social justice issue, because if you have bad teeth it can affect your ability to get a job. Think about someone who fronts up to an interview who's got bad teeth—it can affect your ability to get a job, and it can affect your self-esteem. We need to get dental into Medicare. This is unfinished business for the Greens. In the power-sharing parliament, back in 2010, the Greens worked with Labor and the Independents, and we got dental into Medicare for 3.4 million kids. As a result parents are able to use their Medicare card to get dental treatment for their kids. Now what we've got to do is extend that to the rest of society. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We pride ourselves in this country on having a universal healthcare system. In America they're tearing themselves apart at the moment trying to get somewhere close to what Australia's got. One of the good things about this country is that if you get sick they don't check your credit card. They check that you've got a Medicare card. You can get the help and the health care that you deserve. We need to have the same principle apply to dental care as well. Going to the dentist is far too expensive. People aren't doing it when they should just because they can't afford it. If we want to make Australia more equal, we could start by extending our principle of Medicare and health care for all to include dental care. That's something that the Greens will be fighting for as part of the Green New Deal. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care should be treated as an essential service. I talk regularly to people—they're mostly women, because the burden of organising child care and caring for kids predominantly—not solely, but predominantly—falls on women—who are going through the decision about whether to get back into the paid workforce. The decision that they make after a certain point is, 'I could work an extra day a week, but all of that money's going to be eaten up by childcare fees.' We have seen childcare fees go up and up and up in this country. Every parent who has to deal with childcare bills knows what I'm talking about. It's going up so much that for many women—men as well, but it's mostly women—it's now affecting their ability to make real choices about their life, like whether to go to work or stay home. They're saying, 'I could go to work, but everything I earn from that day I'm going to lose in childcare fees.' We've got an affordability crisis. We've also got an availability crisis in many places, where in some instances families are shuttling kids between two different childcare centres. You can get a day a week at one centre but not the other day that you might want to suit your employer, so you have to drop them off at another centre. Add to that the burden that many parents are facing now that they have to do the double caring job of looking after kids but also looking after their own parents and potentially considering questions about aged care for them. There are people—it's predominantly women—who are stuck in the middle, juggling caring responsibilities above and below and juggling work as well, finding that not only are there all those pressures—which include a lot of pressures to feel like you're doing the right thing that can push many people to the point where they feel really stretched—but the financial pressure of the cost of child care is impinging on their ability to make real decisions about their lives. It is a gender equality issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had some real advances in this country. I pay tribute to the opposition for what they did when they were in government by lifting the standards of early childhood educators. We now have a situation where our kids are getting great-quality education in those preschool years, but what we haven't got right is the question of government stepping up to fund it. We need to start thinking about child care as an essential service. My goal as part of the Green New Deal is to see free universal child care available to every family who wants it. We can get there. It becomes a question of priorities. It's about how much we value women's ability to have control over their lives and how much we value the preschool education of our children. We've made some steps, but it's been at the cost of affordability and accessibility. We need to fix that. As part of a Green New Deal, we put forward universal services and universal access to child care for everyone in this country who wants it. Free child care—in the way that we start to think about other services being free and universally available—is where we need to get to. That's what we will fight for as part of a Green New Deal.</span>

                    <a href="00AN3" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I rise to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and the related bill. We really need to have a proper debate about what's happening fiscally in this country. I think we need to look at a number of things in the economy that are not going particularly well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to note, firstly, that, despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and Treasurer, unemployment is rising in this country. What's becoming of critical concern for Labor and indeed others is that underemployment has been rising now over many years. In fact, underemployment reached a record high last month, according to the ABS. We have a very high underemployment rate, at 8.6 per cent. We have one of the highest underutilisation rates, but there have never been as many underemployed Australians in our history. We have more people now looking for more work in our economy and in our labour market who are not able to find it. If you combine those that have no work with those who have too little work, you have an underutilised economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's one of the reasons why wage growth is so persistently low. Wage growth presided over by this Prime Minister and Treasurer has now been lower than at any time in our history. No real wage growth, stagnant wage growth—in fact, wages are going backwards in many parts of our economy. One of the reasons that's a problem is that there is nothing that the government seeks to do to arrest that problem. There are no plans on foot by the government to lift wages. Low wages means an impact on aggregate demand, which means an impact on our economy and an impact on consumer confidence and business confidence, and that is leading to, as I say, very difficult economic circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government seeks to pretend, and to convince the Australian public, that somehow these problems that are arising have all happened subsequent to the tragic bushfires and the coronavirus. We know that's not true, and the Reserve Bank knows that's not true. Firstly, the Reserve Bank revised down the forecast of the budget on a number of occasions prior to the bushfires and prior to the coronavirus. That's important to remember.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will work with the government on those two issues. We've been seeking to work with the government on the bushfire recovery. Mr Deputy Speaker Rob Mitchell, you know all too well the impacts of bushfires in your electorate over many years, and so too do many members. We're working with the government there. We have provided suggestions to the government. Some have been taken up. We provided one this week in relation to supporting small businesses in fire affected areas, and I'll go to that a little later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is the government cannot pretend that the impact on our economy is just due to those two significant events because the revision of the budget forecast and, perhaps more importantly, the deployment of monetary policy by the Reserve Bank occurred, in the main, prior to those two events. For example, the Reserve Bank cut interest rates on three occasions prior to the bushfires and prior to the coronavirus outbreak. That was because the economy was weakening and because the government does not have an economic plan to respond to the weakening of our economy. The government has left all of the heavy lifting to the Reserve Bank. So the Reserve Bank is using monetary policy, there is no fiscal response by the government and we're now getting to the point where monetary policy cannot be deployed much further, if at all, in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile the suggestions we made to bring forward tax cuts to stimulate the economy fell on deaf ears. I think we'll now find ourselves in greater trouble. That really does go to what I said at the outset, which is that we have a growing problem of underemployment in our labour market as a result in large part from the failing economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may have seemed to be the right thing to do at the time, but it was unwise for the Treasurer to boast about returning the budget to surplus. He liked to use the AC/DC album title <span style="font-style:italic;">Back In Black</span>. He probably should have used Split Enz's song title 'I See Red' because the fact is that the chances of us returning to budget surplus are very unlikely. The reason for that is, as I said, they have no economic plan. If they were honest, they would say that they probably didn't expect to win the last election. They won the election and the plan is not there, and that is becoming increasingly obvious. It's obvious in this place too. The amount of substantial legislation being debated in the parliament is woeful. There are not sufficient bills to deal with the economy or other matters that matter to the Australian public. That speaks to a government that doesn't have an agenda and instead is looking for things to distract the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll work with the government on dealing with the coronavirus, as we have done with the bushfires and the recovery thereafter. We have been critical of the speed with which the government has dealt with that matter. We do think there are major problems. I think the rhetoric of the government doesn't match what's happening in those fire affected regions. Look at the data that has been provided to date in relation to concessional loans and grants. Of all the applications made for concessional loans, as of last Friday fewer than five per cent had been approved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of grants being provided to small businesses, of all of the applications made to provide grants to small businesses in fire affected areas on Kangaroo Island, on the South Coast of New South Wales, in the Blue Mountains or in East Gippsland, only 20 per cent have been approved—one in five applications. We know that small businesses who rely on cash flow cannot wait for a government that is too slow in providing support to them. They cannot wait. Indeed, if they do have to wait, in many cases they will hit the wall. They will go under. The failure to deliver even those things that have been promised by the government to businesses is a major problem. It needs to move much more quickly. But, I'm afraid to say, it's likely that, as a result of the tardiness, the red tape and the sheer lack of political will, small businesses in these fire affected regions will go under. They will go under because of the failure and incompetence of the government. That's the truth of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and I, along with members who represent some of these fire affected areas, suggested a policy for the government to consider implementing to support small business—namely, to use wage assistance in a manner that was used for businesses affected by Cyclone Yasi in 2011. The then Labor government provided assistance in the form of Newstart to businesses to maintain the employment of their staff. It was, effectively, a subsidy for wages. It was taken up. It was effective. It was targeted. It allowed for 13 weeks, and subsequently 26 weeks, of subsidies over that 12-month period. We suggest that the government consider doing that here. We know that the first people to get hit in their local economies are casual employees, part-time and even full-time employees. If these businesses have no revenue coming in then they can't maintain employment for those workers. If those workers are not gainfully employed then they're not spending in the local economy. Not only are businesses directly impacted by the fires in trouble; what is also happening is that other businesses that rely upon the consumption of their goods and services will also falter. This initiative has been used before by a federal government, a Labor government. It can be used by this government too. I'd implore the Prime Minister and indeed the minister for small business and other ministers to consider the proposition that was provided and suggested in good faith by the opposition for not only those businesses that have been impacted, in terms of bricks and mortar, but those businesses on the South Coast, on Kangaroo Island, in Gippsland and in the Blue Mountains that are suffering because revenue has just disappeared. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some businesses in tourism and hospitality have not been directly impacted, in terms of their dwellings having been burnt by fire. But, in terms of the loss of business, they've been well and truly impacted and they will not continue to survive, let alone thrive, if they're not provided with support that's targeted, measured and expeditious. We say to the government: first and foremost you have an obligation to support small businesses in these regions, so when you promise something you have to deliver it, and if you don't deliver it in time then these businesses won't be there to receive the support. The red tape, which is currently congesting the system such that businesses are unable to receive such support, has to be removed. Cut the red tape. Get the support to businesses that need this support, otherwise they won't be there this time next year or, indeed, in a month's time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, we are concerned for small businesses and their employees. If you provide a wage subsidy, as occurred after the terrible affects of Cyclone Yasi, then you'll see businesses being able to maintain employment for some or all of their staff. I think that's a really useful suggestion. It's one that has been tried and tested. It's something the government should really embrace, and I really do hope they think about that. It has been used before, and I'm surprised the government haven't actually thought about using it in these circumstances, given the scale of these bushfires and the impact upon businesses. I really find it difficult to understand why they haven't gone down that path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy is in trouble. It started to falter before the bushfires and before coronavirus. The Treasury was revising the forecasts of the budget well before the outbreak of the coronavirus or, indeed, the fires. So it's not right to say that the correlation is that the economy's now struggling because of these two events. It was occurring before then. Unemployment was rising, underemployment was rising, and we have enormous underutilisation in our labour market. That's also one of the reasons that wages are stagnant: there's no tightening in the labour market if you have record underutilisation at 13.9 per cent of the labour market. The only lever that the government wants to use to increase wages is to see a tightening of the labour market—but, when the labour market is as slack as it is because of record high underemployment, that's not going to happen. If there is no other policy prescription, we will not see wages grow in real terms for a very long time. That of course has an impact on consumer confidence, business confidence and aggregate demand, which continues the cycle and will also have an impact on future employment opportunities and future wage growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government have a lot to do here. We will work with them on these two events, as we have done with the tragic disaster of the bushfires. We have, in good faith, been proposing some good ideas and we ask them to take them up. We ask the Prime Minister to take up the idea of providing wage subsidies to small businesses in fire affected areas, which could do quite a lot for those regions.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I too rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and the related bill. Can I start off by saying that this gives us an opportunity to basically talk about what's been taking place in the appropriations in the last budget, what the government has delivered, what it hasn't delivered and where we are at this point of time in the government's life span. I've got to say that, when talking to a lot of my constituents, as a lot of people do in this place, it is of great concern to hear the things that they're saying to us, not only over the last few months but also over the last six years whilst this Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government have been in place. If you have a look at every aspect of the health, ageing and welfare systems, we're seeing that they're increasingly being hacked away by this government. There have been unprecedented cuts and changes which I would say are cruel which are being made by this government that are vital to services—health services, pensions, Medicare and aged-care policies. I've also got to say that it is of great concern when you see money being pulled out of services that are required, especially when you think about the NDIS—and we were only talking about that the other day—where $4.6 billion has been ripped out of the NDIS from people who are some of the most vulnerable in our society, where that money was meant to give them the dignity that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see a Prime Minister who was previously a salesman, a marketing manager. We're looking for leadership qualities—not just us here in this place but all of Australia—and unfortunately they're extremely lacking. I think Mr Morrison, the Prime Minister, is a very ineffective Prime Minister running a do-nothing government. If you have a look at the history of this government from 2013—as I said, the Abbott, the Turnbull, the Morrison government—there is not one agenda item, a big-ticket item, where you can say: 'This has changed the nation. This particular policy has changed people's lives or will change people's lives.' There is absolutely nothing that you can actually talk about that has happened that will actually change people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen? We've seen the lowest wage growth in the history of our nation, and we know without wage growth the economy will not kickstart. We know without those extra dollars in low paid workers' pockets that will go straight into the economy nothing will happen, yet this government has sat about for the last six years and said that, basically, nothing is in that scope to try and pull some levers to ensure that we have some wage growth so people can spend some extra money in the economy and get the economy going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are no plans for jobs, there are no plans for wage growth and certainly there are no plans to address climate change. In fact, we have a Prime Minister, who as Treasurer at one point, came in here with a hunk of coal and proclaimed how proud he was of it. That is very embarrassing for a nation like Australia, which has always been a leader in the world. To see the Prime Minister of this country today, who then was Treasurer, come in with a hunk of coal, hold it up high in this House, be proud of it and say, 'This is our future,' was absolutely embarrassing. I feel embarrassed as an MP and I feel embarrassed as an Australian, a citizen of this nation, knowing that that man today is our Prime Minister. He's trying to backtrack on this. He's trying to backtrack and say that they do believe in climate change, but we know that he denied climate change many times in the past. As I said, there are no plans for jobs, there are no plans for the economy and certainly no plans for climate change, which is one of the most fundamental issues that's facing not just us but the entire nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can look back at many other things as well. Productivity is at the lowest it has ever been. Unemployment is growing at a fast pace. We know people are underemployed, perhaps working part-time jobs but not earning enough to pay their bills and to put food on the table. Those numbers are growing. Then you look at the absolute stuff-ups that have taken place—things like robodebt, where many Australians, through no fault of their own, were sent notices saying that they owed money to Centrelink. We've seen what's taken place with that, where the government has backtracked. They've gotten rid of the system, but it took close to 2½ years before they admitted that it was wrong. No matter what we said in this place on this side of the House, where we raised the issue continuously, where the Leader of the Opposition raised it continuously in the media and in questions in this place, what we heard was: 'There's nothing to see here. It's all above board.' Yet today we find out that the whole system of robodebt was a complete mess which put a lot of pensioners and a lot of people who were on payments in a lot of distress. You can imagine someone who's an age pensioner in their 80s receiving a notice from Centrelink saying, 'You haven't done the right thing and you owe us X amount of dollars.' With many constituents that we saw and that we represented on this particular issue, we had their debts reduced or they were told that they owed nothing. Imagine the thousands of people who, because they're good, hardworking, honest Australians, just went to Centrelink and paid that debt. There'd be thousands of them. We saw these debts were often lacking in detail. They were void of a breakdown of costs, and information was really difficult to access. This was one of the biggest stuff-ups that I've seen since I've been here—taking money off innocent Australians when it was not their fault. But it's not only that; there is the trauma that they were put through. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One particular constituent whom we had contact with back in September of last year has yet to be provided with any clear information or explanation as to how the governance of Centrelink arrived at an allocated robodebt figure of over $1,300. We're talking about someone who is on a minimal income—one of the Australians who is right at the bottom end of the income that they receive compared to the rest of the nation. Basically, they simply referenced it as an overpayment of a family tax payment in the previous years—no detail, no figures to show where and what. Despite this family's best efforts and ongoing quest to have such information provided, no clear explanation has been forthcoming to date. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me on to another saga that's taking place right now before us, and that's the 2020 sports funding rort. We've heard much about that. We heard that the former minister, Bridget McKenzie, wrote to the Prime Minister, directly attaching the spreadsheet she intended to approve for round 3 sports rorts. She did this, as we heard in this House yesterday, on 10 April, the day before Scott Morrison called the election—the very day before the election was called. We know that the minister then sent the final brief, signed, to Sport Australia on 11 April at 8.46 am, after parliament was dissolved and caretaker conventions commenced. After this revelation, the Prime Minister told the parliament he did not approve the projects and they were signed off by the sports minister on 4 April 2019. There were 136 emails over a six-month period between the PMO and the sports minister's office about sports rorts, yet the Prime Minister comes in here and denies that he was hands on with this particular grant. He was knee deep in it, and what was told to the parliament yesterday proves it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have many sporting clubs in my electorate of Adelaide that are desperately seeking money and are desperately doing community work. Kids are playing sport from under-10s right through to their senior teams. One club is the Broadview Football Club. They have done spectacular work for the community in my electorate. They are one of these sporting clubs that may well have unfairly missed out. How could they possibly have received a grant when these rorts were taking place? How could they have possibly ever received a grant? And they are a great club. So I feel for the clubs that are doing the right thing and perhaps aren't in a marginal seat or are not in a seat where there's a member of the government that represents it. It's just an outrageous practice, where we're funnelling money away from clubs that need it to clubs that perhaps may not need it, or are getting it for electoral benefit, which is wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other dedicated, highly visible and most productive sporting clubs within my electorate which also appear to have been disadvantaged and had no show of ever receiving any grants and missed out as well include Croydon Kings Football Club, a club that really desperately needed some funding to relocate because DPTI—the transport department—was taking their land and they were left without a home ground. We tried everything we possibly could to get some funding for that great club, yet nothing came of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adelaide Comets is another one. Take the Adelaide Lutheran Sports Club. Go and see their change rooms; the ceilings are falling down. There is no women's change room. The women have to change in their cars during training and during games, which is totally unacceptable. Here are some clubs that deserved some sort of funding, yet they had no show at all. The Ghan Kilburn Soccer Club is a great club started by the Afghan community in the northern parts of my electorate. They have many young people playing who have come here as refugees without parents, on their own, some as young as 15 or 16 years old. It is a great club doing great work. They are after funding, yet they received zero after us writing to the Prime Minister, to the Treasurer, to everyone. These are clubs that should have been looked at. They should have been judged and they would have been deemed to be needy clubs for the community. They not only provide sporting facilities but also provide community contribution. The Ghan Kilburn Soccer Club does amazing work, not just on the sporting field but within the community as well. Without the support of this club, who knows what many of these kids would be doing if this club weren't there to give them that camaraderie and that family feel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get to the waiting list for home-care packages. We know that this saga has been going on for a long time and we welcome the extra funding that the minister has put into this area. But still, when you have 120,000 people waiting for a package at any one time to receive some care that they need within their homes, it is not acceptable. Yet we're no closer to resolving this unacceptable state of affairs. Our seniors and frail elderly citizens have been faced with extensive waiting lists with little regard for their health or wellbeing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the Christmas period last year a woman called us who had a carer looking after her. This particular woman was in her 80s and had an amputated leg, diabetes and a whole range of other health issues. She needed someone to help her shower in the morning—not every morning; just two to three times a week was all she was asking for. Over that Christmas period the carer for some reason told her that she wouldn't be coming for two weeks because she was on a break. They could not get someone else. We rang the minister's office, we wrote letters and finally, with a lot of angst, we got someone through a package to go and see her. It's not fair. It's not right when you have an elderly person who has worked all their life and paid their taxes, through no fault of their own they have very bad health, they have aged and have no-one else in this world, yet we couldn't find someone for her, which should have been systematically and automatically done for about a week after Christmas. For a week after Christmas this woman stayed at home, not showered, and who knows what she was eating. It was an unacceptable situation to be in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people passed away before they got their packages, or their relatives received a letter saying a package had been approved or was about to be started, yet they had passed away whilst waiting for their home-care packages to become effective. This is not good enough. We need to look after our elderly. We need to look after those people who built the foundations of this nation that we enjoy today, where we pick the fruits of their hard work today and live the lives that we do. These people have worked, they have paid taxes and they deserve the dignity that we should give them in their twilight years. It is wrong that a person in their mid-80s with an amputated leg and a history of illnesses had no care for over a week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In another situation, one of my constituents from Croydon Park contacted me about his father, who suffers from a range of health and medical conditions, including osteoarthritis, cardiac ailments, poor memory, dementia, reduced mobility, walking and balance issues— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

These additional estimates appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this financial year. Passage of the bills will ensure continuity of government programs, commencement of new activities agreed by the government since the 2019-20 budget and the Commonwealth's ability to meet its obligations for 2019-20 as they fall due. Importantly, these bills also include funding in response to the recent bushfires. Once again I thank all members for their contribution and commend these bills to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor see this as very significant legislation. We have referred this bill to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee to ensure that it receives proper scrutiny because it's very important to get a change of this scale and this significance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a new method for calculating a family's capacity to contribute to the cost of their child's education in non-government schools. The changes that are being made would calculate this capacity based on a direct measure of the family's income rather than on the average of the neighbourhood in which a student lives. This reform was originally recommended by the independent National School Resourcing Board, and, before that, the change was recommended in the original Gonski review. It wasn't practical at that time, based on the data that we had, but recent improvements in the Multi-Agency Data Integration Project mean that this moderate measure is now possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In principle, of course we support a move to a more accurate and reliable measurement of a school community's capacity to contribute to the cost of education in non-government schools. The new measurement offers a more precise reflection of socioeconomic status and would mean that funding flows more smoothly to the non-government schools that need it the most. For example, under the current area based approach, if a neighbourhood contains both a low-fee and elite independent school both would receive the same socioeconomic status score, even if one takes in students from lower-income families and one takes in students from wealthier families. Under the new arrangement, the lower-income school will receive a lower capacity-to-contribute score, while the wealthier school's score will increase. The wealthier school's capacity-to-contribute score will increase because those higher-income families can obviously afford to make a greater contribution to the cost of their child's private education. As far as it goes, this does mean that funding will be distributed more fairly within non-government schools than the existing arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were last in government, we introduced the Schooling Resource Standard so that there would be an objective measure of the cost of properly educating a child, including loadings for factors like the socioeconomic status, remoteness, size of school, number of Indigenous students, disability, and English language proficiency of students. That figure for non-government schools is then discounted by a parent's capacity to contribute. Of course, we absolutely believe that school funding should be guided by need. Our efforts in government were designed to make sure that funding was distributed on the basis of need. Of course, that hasn't been the case under this government. Our original approach of sector-blind, needs based funding is paid lip service by those opposite but certainly has not been delivered in reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we have moved this second reading amendment is that, while we support the more direct measure of income that is contemplated by this legislation, this legislation continues the government's absolute refusal to properly fund public schools. We have always supported the government restoring some of the funding that was cut from non-government schools, but it should do the same for public schools. There is no reason that they would restore the funding that they've cut from non-government schools but continue the funding cuts to public schools. That's exactly what those opposite have decided to do. For the parents of the 2½ million students in public schools, the schools that educate two-thirds of Australian children, the message from this government is absolutely clear. They are saying: we don't care that your school will never reach its fair funding level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a very warped understanding of student need in this country. Public schools educate 82 per cent of the poorest children in Australia. They teach 84 per cent of First Nations children and 74 per cent of children with disabilities. When it comes to funding decisions and practical support, this government works on the basis that the schools that need the greatest support will get the least. Public schools have never been their priority and, in fact, inequality is written into funding agreements. In the funding deals with the states and territories, the coalition has insisted that the states and territories top up non-government school funding to 100 per cent of their fair funding level, the Schooling Resource Standard plus loadings, by 2023. But public schools will only ever get to 95 per cent of their fair funding level based on the agreements signed with the states and territories by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You look at particularly poor systems like the Northern Territory and Tasmania. The Northern Territory and Tasmania do worst under these arrangements. They do very badly indeed. The states that have the greatest number of children who are struggling educationally and who need the greatest support actually do worst under the coalition's funding arrangements. The government has also included a loophole, a cheat, for the states and territories, where states and territories will be able to include the cost of school transport schemes, depreciation and so on. These costs were never contemplated in the original calculations of the Schooling Resource Standard, because they don't go directly to the cost of educating children. Kids in public schools will do worse again because of the funding agreements signed by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In effect, what this means is that by 2023 almost every non-government school will be funded at or above their fair funding level while almost no public schools will be. That's the impact. That's the effect on public schools in all of your electorates. This is what you're doing to them. This is what you're doing to public schoolkids. This is not sector-blind needs based funding; this is 100 per cent sector specific. If you're going to a non-government school, those opposite insist you get 100 per cent or more of your fair funding level. If you're going to a public school you'll never get more than 95 per cent based on the arrangements made by those opposite. That's a very powerful message to the parents of those 2.5 million schoolchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another issue that I want to flag with this bill. With this bill we're moving important funding provisions from legislation to regulation. It's just not best practice. This includes the transitional arrangements for schools with capacity-to-contribute scores that will rise under these changes. The government should not be doing what it's doing here, which is essentially issuing itself a blank cheque to do special deals, to do side deals, particularly without parliamentary oversight. I really don't think this is best practice, and I don't think it's something that should generally be encouraged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to schooling, Labor absolutely believes in parental choice and we support the parents. We have fought side by side with parents who send their kids to non-government schools to see this funding restored—funding that's previously been cut by those opposite. But for there to be genuine choice for parents we have to have a properly funded public school system, too—and that's what those opposite consistently refuse to provide. And you really don't have to go too far to see the impact of that in our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August last year, the ABC published an investigation into Australian schools, looking at the way capital was distributed across the school system—and the disparity that was uncovered by that investigation really was quite shocking. Between 2013 and 2017, half of the total $22 billion spent on school capital improvements in Australia was spent in just 10 per cent of schools. So half the money was spent in one-tenth of the schools—and, as the investigation found, most of the schools were already pretty well-furnished schools with facilities well beyond those of your average public school. At the same time, the ABC found an urgent demand in public schools for the basics—new classrooms, enough classrooms, toilet maintenance, leaking roofs, heating and cooling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, not every school can have an orchestra pit or a new aquatic centre, but every parent should be confident that their local school, the school closest to home, can provide their child with a great education, a world-class education, and an education as good as any education they can get in an elite school—that there will be enough books, enough computers, enough sporting equipment, and buildings that are built and maintained in a way that shows every child that we value the education that they're receiving at their school and that we care about every child's education equally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This all comes as Australia experiences a long-term decline in our students' results in reading, in maths and in science. In 2018, according to data from the Program for International Student Assessment—or PISA, as we call it—Australia recorded its worst results in reading, maths and science since that international testing began. For the first time ever, Australia's performance in maths was no better than the global average. In maths, 15-year-olds performed more than a year below those 15-year-olds that were tested in 2002, a year lower in reading than those who were tested in 2000 and a year worse in science than in 2006.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across all subjects and age groups, right across the board—in government and non-government schools and in every state and territory—our schools are, broadly, going backwards. There are also major disparities within classrooms and schools, with the most advanced students in a year typically five to six years ahead of the least advanced students. We know that children who haven't mastered the basics by the age of eight will struggle to catch up for the rest of their schooling and that early difficulties can result in lifelong problems. What are we doing to fix this? Nothing. This is a government that has no plan to fix this. If we're not fixing these problems in the early years of schooling, we are consigning students to a lifetime of struggle. By these measures we are currently preparing a future workforce that is less equipped for the world of work than the workforce was 20 years ago. We see very worrying implications for our long-term economic growth if our slide in education results continues, with a one per cent change in literacy associated with a 2½ per cent change in labour productivity. We have seen labour productivity sliding in this country for the first time. We can't turn this around. We can't improve our labour productivity unless we're prepared to invest in our people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has no plan to arrest this alarming slide in results and no plan to properly resource our public schools. It's no surprise that the economy its responsible for is in such a dismal state. Wages are stagnant, productivity is static, business investment is down and household debt keeps going up. Labour productivity, as I said, is going backwards for the first time since records began. Economic growth is at its lowest level since the global financial crisis and, in fact, has halved under the Prime Minister's watch. The Liberals have no plan to reverse the shocking drops in student outcomes. They've got no plan to acknowledge the fundamental relationship between education and our economy, and they've got no plan to properly fund public schools. If this government continues its neglect, if it continues to put public education last, we'll continue to see sliding results, more economic malaise, more stagnation and sliding living standards. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr VAN MANEN:</span>
                    </a>  The Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill forms part of the measures this government is taking to give all Australian children the quality education they deserve regardless of where they live or what school they attend by providing the funding that is fairly and transparently distributed and allocated according to need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go into the specifics of the bill, I think it's important to set out the context we find ourselves in in relation to government funding of schools. Funding of non-government schools in Australia is a shared responsibility between the parents and the guardians of the students attending those schools, the Australian government and state and territory governments. Through this bill the Australian government is introducing a more accurate methodology to calculate the capacity of the non-government school community to contribute to the cost of schooling. This more targeted and accurate direct measure of income will support the Australian government needs based funding model for all Australian schools, and under the government's Quality Schools package there will be more Commonwealth government money for disadvantaged students through loading payments, including those in remote and regional areas, and those with disability and Indigenous students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes to change the capacity-to-contribute methodology and the school's transition to a uniform Commonwealth share of the Schooling Resource Standard. The financial impact of these changes is an estimated additional $1.3 billion investment from the Commonwealth in recurrent funding over the budget and forward estimates from 2019-20 to 2022-23, and an estimated $3.4 billion increase in the recurrent funding over the 10 years to 2028-29. This will see the Commonwealth's investment in our children's education increase to a total of $314 billion from 2018-29.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes measures that support financial certainty by allowing schools time to plan as the new arrangements are implemented. Certainty in funding is essential to allow schools to plan for the future and the measures in this bill will help them do just that. Let me briefly outline how the Commonwealth funds schooling in Australia, because I note with interest the member for Sydney's comments earlier. We contribute funding to both government and non-government schools through the Australian Education Act. As things currently stand, recurrent school funding is calculated by reference to a base amount of funding for every primary and secondary school student along with six loadings that provide extra funding for disadvantaged students and schools. It is commonly referred to as the Schooling Resource Standard, and for most non-government schools the base component of the Schooling Resource Standard is discounted by a capacity-to-contribute percentage. The capacity-to-contribute discount is calculated based on the area based measure. Under this methodology the school community's capacity to contribute is calculated by averaging certain indicators of socioeconomic status for each ABS statistical area in which the students at the school reside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new methodology included in this bill was the result of recommendations made by the National School Resourcing Board in its review of the SES status score methodology in its final report. As part of the review, the board consulted widely and it received 34 substantive responses to the issues paper, including a number of detailed proposals which informed the board's consideration and analysis. The board also received 261 submissions, which were largely part of a coordinated standard response from individuals and school communities. The board members also undertook 38 face-to-face consultations, in all states and territories, with non-government education authorities, school leaders, communities, state and government agencies, researchers, policy analysts and other interested parties. The Australian government agreed to all six recommendations made by the board and this bill gives effect to the relevant recommendations to implement the capacity-to-contribute function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding for schools in Forde across both government and non-government sectors will increase over the next 10 years. This particularly assists schools like Beenleigh Special School, where estimated Commonwealth funding per student is set to increase from $9,720 in 2019 to $14,502 per student in 2029. This will allow the school to have more specialised programs to provide their students with greater learning opportunities and experience and to build on the already outstanding work that Beenleigh Special School does each and every day for their students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Catholic and independent schools, including St Matthew's Catholic Primary School at Cornubia and St Philomena School in Park Ridge, will also receive average increases of a little bit under four per cent in funding per student from 2018-2029, allowing more families from a diverse range of backgrounds to have a greater choice in their children's education. I note with interest that I received an email from St Philomena School yesterday talking about the improvements they're going to make to that school over the next few years and the redevelopment of that school. Those plans look extraordinarily exciting, and the contribution to the community will be enormous as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government schools will also continue to receive record levels of total Australian government funding, with an estimated $127.8 billion of recurring funding expected to flow to government schools from 2018-2029. In fact, government spending is the fastest growing for state schools, at around 6.4 per cent per student each year through 2018-23, compared to student growth of about five per cent for the non-government sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this bill, the school funding model will remain sector-blind and Australian government funding for non-government schools will continue to transition to 80 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard. The government will continue to refine the model over time. The government is continuing to deliver a needs based funding arrangement to ensure that students with the same need in the same sector attract the same level of support, so that every Australian child, no matter where they live, can have access to a world-class education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the outstanding work of the educators across all the schools in my electorate of Forde. Every day they are there at the forefront, whether it is the classroom, whether it's the cleaners, the groundsmen, the janitors, the principals, the administration staff—all of them do an outstanding job every day with a genuine and heartfelt desire to ensure that the students in their care have the ability to be the very best that they can be. I want to use this opportunity to thank them for their efforts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning of this speech, I believe that children are our future. This government certainly believes that. We are putting the money where it counts to achieve the best possible outcomes for Australian students. I commend the original form of this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  As the seconder of this amendment I am pleased to speak on it. The Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020 does some important things. I would note, firstly, that it is the seventh year of this government. Since they took office their penchant in education has been to always be focused on the numbers and rarely be focused on the outcomes. This bill puts in place a change in the funding regime that is, limited to the independent school sector, where it would cover non-government schools—that is, independent and Catholic schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill in itself and the move to implement the new system, which allows the assessment of each school and its parents' capacity to make a contribution to that education, is a much finer discretionary tool than the one we currently have, which uses the SES which is built into the ICSEA scale. I would support this bill simply on the fact that it rights an aberration that has been long held in the Commonwealth funding of non-government schools. That is the aberration that allows somebody to set up an independent school in a low-socioeconomic area with no intention of drafting students from that low-socioeconomic area but attracting significant Commonwealth funding on the back of their geography. To be specific, I think of Geelong, where we have a school in a low-socioeconomic area of Corio that attracts enormous Commonwealth funding, which does not reflect the nature of the students in that school or their parents' capacity to pay, quite bluntly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that sense I think this is a good amendment. I know that some of the independent and Catholic schools in my area would welcome this. I've spoken to them at length. As someone who was a school principal, I understand the funding models that we're using here and I understand the demography of a school and how that, with parents' capacity to make a contribution, often impacts on what a school can offer in terms of its broad facilities. There are many schools in my community in the seat of Lalor that are what we call low-fee schools, which may be independent, Catholic—I think of two Muslim schools in my community—growing schools with large numbers of students and large numbers of families for whom that's a choice. I know that this will make a difference to them, because it will allow the use of people's actual incomes to help determine the funding model that will be in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to make a clear point about that as well. We know from what the government has provided us that it's going to make a difference to a considerable number of schools and that there's going to be an adjustment period. It's going to make a considerable difference to a number of schools. There are I think 810 private schools that will be better funded because of this discrete measure and 59 schools, I think, that will lose money. I assume that the school in Corio will be on that list and will find itself not funded to the extent that it has been. That is, quite bluntly, outrageous and this is the first attempt the government has made to change any of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will be most accurate where most of the student population's parents are PAYG salary or wage earners and are paying tax as they go, because their taxable income has fewer deductions. We know what they're earning, we know what their taxable income is and we all know that there are many fewer variations that they can have in establishing their taxable income. For those families that are in business, let's say, it may not be as accurate. I expect that in communities like mine this will be a fairly accurate indicator. Further, I'd go to the point that has been made in Victoria time and time again, which is that this is about a family's capacity to pay. For the private sector, that's a reasonable basis to be funding schools on. But we know in Victoria through our government system that the best indicator of a child's projected outcomes in education is parental education levels, which shape parental attitudes to school, which shape student attitudes to school. The more highly educated the parent body is, the more likely it is that the school will achieve higher outcomes. This was the beginning of the understanding, the beginning of the regime that saw Labor pursue a sector-blind, needs based approach. This legislation adjusts something to support non-government schools but flies in the face of that integral part of a needs based, sector-blind system. It does something but it does not add one cent to government schools from the Commonwealth, it does nothing to change the inequity that we see in our school system and it therefore does nothing to improve the quality of our education overall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we asked most Australians if they wanted a world-class education system they'd say yes. If we asked most Australians if they wanted a fairer Australia they'd say yes. If we asked most Australians if they wanted to grow the economy and create a more prosperous society they'd say yes. But what this piece of legislation highlights, in the fact that it is focused purely on the non-government sector and adds not one more dollar to the public sector, is that those opposite say no to all of those questions. That's what this legislation does. It reminds us that when those opposite had an opportunity they voted against equality. They voted against a world-class education system, because they voted against a system that was going to be sector blind and needs based. They are now seeing it in sector terms as this legislation demonstrates to us so clearly. They are seeing it in sector terms, not as an opportunity to develop Australia's world-class education system. I say that because this government has abandoned all reform in the education space other than monetary reform. This legislation before us highlights that again. It's about monetary reform. It's about parents' capacity to pay. It is not about creating positive educational cultures. It is not about ensuring that every child in our school system is supported so that they can achieve their potential. That's not what this legislation is about. This legislation is about dollars and cents, and that is all it's about. It's not about education at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make that point really clearly: the amendment goes to the government's failure—to their neglect of public education. The bill speaks to that, in the absence of public education being included. It goes to the fact that our standards are slipping and they have abandoned the reform agenda—absolutely abandoned it. If it hasn't got a dollar sign in it, they're not interested in it. They're only interested in ensuring that the status quo—that is, the inequality entrenched into our school system—stays where it is. That's what they're committed to, and they've failed to come up with a long-term education policy for the nation and the economy. There's nothing clearer than the fact that we're here today. They're implementing an idea that has been around for a decade, after seven years in government. Seven years in government, and now they're going to implement this simple measure that could have made a difference and could have changed significantly the waiting, even in the non-government sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part that we need to highlight in this bill is that 810 private schools will be better off under this measure, or more 'fairly funded' under this measure—fairly funded purely through the lens of the private sector—and 59 will lose funding. But then we go to the detail and we find that there's going to be a two-year transition period. These 59 schools are transitioning again. This is going to implement a system that says, 'These parents in this school have the capacity to make this kind of a contribution.' So why do we need two years to do that? It brings to mind all of the rhetoric that we heard when this government tore up the sector-blind, needs based funding model. They tore it up, and we were all in this chamber when that happened, when they voted not to do the right thing. It absolutely tore up our chance of getting the kind of equality we need for a first-class education for all of our students, and the rhetoric was around the 27 deals. We kept hearing the Prime Minister at that time, Malcolm Turnbull, talking about the 27 separate deals and how they were going to do a better job. Now they're going to enter into, possibly, 59 separate deals with 59 individual schools to transition across to a new funding model. So 27 arrangements with different sectors and different states was too much to bear, but we're going to build this system and then we're going to have an opportunity for schools that are worse off to transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to look at schools that are worse off and the options that are being put in place here, because some of it's quite unbelievable. 'Over 2020 to 2022, schools will move to the new direct measure. In 2020 and 2021, schools will be provided with three different options for working out their capacity to make a contribution score. Schools will automatically receive the most beneficial of these three options.' I ask myself: what year is it? My answer is: it's 2020. 'The first option is to use the current SES methodology using the 2011 census data'—2011 census data! The second option is the 2016 census data and the third option is the new system. Whichever one works best for that school, they can move into it. For a start, I don't know how the 2011 census data can possibly be relevant in this case. It seems to me that the government is hell-bent on making a change with this legislation, but making the fall as soft as it can across the sector, because it doesn't want to come here and tell us that it had to make 59 separate arrangements with 59 private schools to make this work. So it's set up a fudge, if you like, around that process. The fact of the matter is that a fund goes with this legislation where those schools may be able to appeal this process and sit down with someone in government and figure out how they might transition across. That means how they might not lose money—how they might ensure that they continue to be funded in an inequitable way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in this place knows my background. Everyone in this place knows that I spent 27 years in public education. Everyone in this place knows that it saddens me every time I come in here to speak about education that the focus from those opposite is not on reform. It is not on a scientific approach to our classrooms. It is not about building teacher capacity. It is not about supporting schools to do the best work that they can do. No, it's about money. On this side, the money arguments are actually about building equality into the system. The money arguments are about supporting reform to ensure that every child gets every chance in every school in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To emphasise that, in 2019, there were 3,948,811 students enrolled in 9,503 schools across this country. Of those students, two-thirds were enrolled in government schools, 19½ per cent enrolled in Catholic schools and 14.18 per cent enrolled in independent schools. In this place, all this Commonwealth government wants to do is suggest that the Commonwealth funds private schools while states fund public schools. Well, if we want a world-class education for every child in this country, it will require federal action. It will require Commonwealth attention, because otherwise the state-to-state variation is going to hold our children back. It supports the fact that the in-school difference and the between-school difference are already holding our children back. Our slipping of standards and our slipping of achievement against international standards is demonstration of that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. An excellent education system is vitally important to Australia. At a macro level, it's vital economically, socially, for adaptation into the future and for cohesiveness as a nation. At an individual level, obviously education provides people with an opportunity to learn, to develop knowledge, to develop skills, to develop understanding and to rise to their potential.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government strongly supports the rights of parents to choose the best school for their child. To enable this, we need to have strong and vibrant public and private systems—systems which allow for a diversity of schools to flourish. We also need to ensure that the choice is an affordable one. To that end, funding must be provided for each and every child, regardless of the school system their parents choose. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> Before I commence again, I want to note that it is wonderful to once again see school students in the public gallery. To all the school students up there: I ask you to ask the parliamentary education officer who is with you to explain the quorum-calling game that is currently being played. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To pick up where I left off, within the context of the vitality of having an excellent education system, I do want to note—and it is not directly relevant to this bill, but it is relevant to education—the government is providing a record $314 billion investment in recurrent funding for schools from 2018 to 2029. It will grow from $21 billion this year to $32 billion in 2029. There is record funding for all schools—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  In the remaining time available to me I want to outline that the new method of calculating funding for non-government schools, the direct measure of income, is a very positive move. However, as with any change, there will be differential impacts on schools under the new method. Indeed, of the 13 independent schools in my electorate, seven will move to a higher level of funding, two will stay the same and four will move to a lower level of funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already been in contact with the schools which are going to have a lower level of funding, and I, like the minister and this government, do appreciate the concerns that they have expressed. To assist them with the transition, the government has put in place a lengthy transition period, over 10 years; $1.2 billion in the new Choice and Affordability Fund to help those schools; and a robust review process, which is currently being developed, which will enable independent schools that believe they need to have their new funding relooked at to go through this process. The things that they might request to be considered would include sudden changes to local economic circumstances; recent significant changes in student enrolment numbers; unique circumstances of the school community, such as where the parents or guardians have a greater number of dependants; and other exceptional circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of finishing, I would note that the purpose of this bill is to implement the recommendation of the National School Resourcing Board. It will establish a new and more targeted and accurate way to calculate the capacity of families to contribute to the cost of sending their kids to a non-government school. It is a needs based model which is designed to get the best results for students, parents and teachers. The more targeted and direct measure of income will make school funding more equitable by ensuring that funding flows to the schools that need it most. Under this model, by 2029, students with the same need in the same sector will attract the same level of support.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  To start, Labor supports the basis of the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. I certainly support the amendment moved by the member for Sydney; however, the bill, as it's formed, makes a lot of sense, particularly for areas that I have the honour to represent in Western Sydney. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've spoken about on many occasions, my electorate is one of the most multicultural in the country. As a matter of fact, I receive the majority of refugees that come to Australia. One thing that I've learnt from the many years of representing people in my community, particularly those who have come here fleeing violence, fleeing torture and fleeing oppression, is that they not only come here for a new start; they also bring with them a passionate belief in education. From their backgrounds, they know that the difference between success and otherwise—particularly in a country like Australia—starts with a good education for their children. So it's not uncommon in my community to see the parents working two or three jobs to ensure their kids get the best opportunities in education that they can possibly give them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people I represent are not rich; my community's certainly not a rich community. As a matter of fact, the average household income—not the average income, but the average household income—is a tad over $60,000 a year, so it's not rich. But those mums and dads out there understand that giving their kids a future starts with a very good education. I would have thought that's one thing that we should all subscribe to in this place: every child needs to have the opportunity of a great education. It should not be subject to politics. One thing that we should be able to agree upon is that every dollar that we invest in education is an investment in this country's future. It's not just for a particular child or a particular community; everything we put into education invests in the future of our country. As I said at the start, I see a lot of benefits in what's being proposed in this bill in changing the identification models for determining funding for independent and systemic Catholic schools, which do play a significant role in providing education to children and certainly kids in my area in Fowler.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially the bill builds on recommendations made by the National School Resourcing Board, which recommends moving away from the SES model, the socioeconomic status model, for determining the funding and moving to a new model based on the direct measure of income. I understand from speaking to principals that there have been issues over time with the SES model, trying to work out the period over the calculation which it's made; whereas the new model of direct measurement of income will be averaged over a three-year period on a rolling basis. That will help avoid or minimise the fluctuations that can occur, particularly when there are areas of high casualised employment in our community. Sometimes people are going to earn more in a particular year than another year. So this is probably a far more accurate measure for determining the basis of the contribution to be made on a schools basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because it is a significant change, it will be phased in, which will take some time to do. It will also cost some money to do that. Because you're changing the model and, without putting too fine a point on it, there will be winners and losers, to ensure that there is fairness and balance, the government has also provided $3.2 billion over the next 10 years to the non-government schools as they transition to the new measure. That's in addition to the $170.8 million available in the 2019 year to give funding certainty to those schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, there will be a $1.2 billion choice of affordability fund to address specific challenges in the non-government school sector. As I say, there will be winners and losers. There will probably be some challenges in the transition to the new model. This fund will help smooth those challenges out. It essentially ensures that schools won't miss out and, more importantly, the kids won't miss out in respect to that funding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure as it's proposed will be far fairer in determining the funding relationship between the government and non-government school sectors. Over the last couple of years I have got a lot of comments from the Catholic Education Commission, and I note that they are certainly supportive of this measure, as they think it will be a far more accurate evaluation of a school's capacity in respect of its funding. The Catholic Education Commission have indicated that they estimate that three-quarters of their schools will receive a more favourable treatment under the capacity-to-contribute formula under this mechanism than before. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm certainly not deaf to the concerns of others. I note particularity the concerns expressed by the Australian Education Union, particularly in their involvement in representing teachers in the government sector. They've made a lot of comments, and I don't disagree with much of what they've said, by the way. It's not that they're arguing against the provisioning to non-government schools, but they are saying that the federal government is really taking their eye off government schools, state schools for instance. The government won the last election. Regrettably we have to concede that. But in the last two elections alone, education, along with health, has been front and centre in the political contest. I remember back in 2013 when the then education minister—I'm pretty sure was Christopher Pyne—maybe feeling a little under the pump at that stage, wanted to talk about how there would not be daylight between Labor's policy on education and their policy on education. As a matter of fact, he went on to say that of the Liberal Party, 'We match Labor's promises on education dollar for dollar.' In other words, he made it very clear in this place that it doesn't matter which party you'll vote for; you'll get the same outcome in education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was in 2013. The very next budget came in May 2014, and what do you think they did? They went and cut education. Despite having a promise that we're going to say that education is a sacred cow and we all believe that our investment in education is an investment in the country's future—despite going through all that rhetoric—the very first budget opportunity that they had to prove that, they cut it. So they've got a track record. Under Tony Abbott they dumped the reforms designed to lift the standards of basic reading, writing and mathematics, and under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull they abandoned proper and fair funding for schools. This mob opposite have a track record when it comes to talking about education. They talk the big game but deliver precious little.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just what they do in relation to schools. Education is pretty holistic. Education is about primary and secondary schools certainly. It's also about universities and, importantly for a country like Australia that needs to increase its skill base, it's about TAFE and vocational education. In their next budgets, they actually moved to cut TAFE funding by $3 billion. It's just not by any accident now that we have 150,000 fewer apprentices at a time when we need a skill base in this country. The only way that they are actually going to get the skills is by importing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our children deserve to know that we are doing everything we can to ensure that they get the proper education and they can move to sustainable, secure, well-paid jobs in this country. Part of that equation is also about our tertiary education system of universities. What do you think they did in respect of universities? They cut $2.2 billion out of our universities. Our universities are forced to take more overseas students to be able to run their programs. Our universities are forced to do more work in collaboration with supportive industries to support education. I think the kids of Australia deserve to know that we in this place, for the limited time that we actually get to be here, are going to do everything we can to secure their futures, and simply cutting education is not the way to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I get back to where I started. I do think the direct measurement of income will be of tangible benefit in calculating the contribution targets for the non-government schools sector. I think it will certainly level the playing field in areas where there may be a systemic Catholic school or low-socioeconomic area alongside a more elite school. As it is at the moment, it's calculated on their area. If they're in a low-SES area geographically, that means they will both be treated the same. Now, that should not be the case. We must make sure that every child gets the benefit of a good, well-rounded education in every school. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, I support the amendment moved by the member for Sydney and I also support the underlying rationale contained in the government's proposition in the bill before us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I rise in support of the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. If there's one thing that we learnt from the disastrous years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, it is that just throwing money at a problem is never the way to solve it. The solution to every problem, according to members opposite, is to spend more, with no thought about where it's going, and then, when that doesn't work and you run out of cash, you spend even more. That's why Labor presided over a budget deficit that peaked at $54½ billion and it's why, nearly a decade later, they went to the last election proposing an additional $387 billion in new taxes. Those opposite have learned nothing from that defeat, as that remains their policy today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, however, understand that solving a complex problem requires a sophisticated, practical response. In the first instance, we look to reform, not to raiding ordinary Australians' bank accounts. Second, if we do find that more money really is needed to solve the problem, then we deliver that investment. But, when we do so, we introduce a third vital element, so often missed by members opposite when they sit on these government benches. We make sure investment is delivered equitably and delivered to the places where it will make the greatest difference in solving the problems. When it comes to the problems facing education in this country, we've applied this practical approach, and the bill before the House is a central contribution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is certain that we need to make improvements to the Australian education system; change is needed. The latest report of the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, published in December last year, showed that, since 2000, Australian students' performance in reading, maths and science has been in relative decline. Though on a par with similar countries—New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan—our students' performance has been slipping compared with important near-neighbours like China, Singapore and Korea. These declines have been consistent across governments on both sides of politics, with some of the largest declines coming during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Education has said, the time has come for us to change direction. But the government understands that simply throwing money at the problem is not enough. Funding to education has been increasing every year, yet performance has not increased. Clearly, as the coalition have always said, we need more than just money; we need reform as well as investment and we need our investment delivered to the right places. This government has been getting on with the job of delivering all three. First, in partnership with the states and territories— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed) </span>As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, first, in partnership with the states and territories, we're rolling out a generation-defining reform in how—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  We all know that scene from <span style="font-style:italic;">Braveheart</span> when Mel Gibson was riding up and down in front of his troops, and he said, 'You can take our land'—you can take my minutes from this speech—'but you'll never take our freedom.' So, first in partnership with the states and territories, we're rolling out a generation-defining reform in how education is delivered in Australia. We're ensuring teacher quality and raising standards in the sector by more rigorous testing of trainee teachers. We're acting to make sure that teaching draws the kind of talented leaders that we need by insisting that teachers score in the top 30 per cent of their peers for literacy and numeracy. We're backing the full implementation of NAPLAN to ensure that parents and teachers get transparency on student progress and to promote accountability in the sector. Along with better trained teachers, we need to improve the content that they are required to teach. That is why the government is refocusing the Australian curriculum on the skills and information that students need to know. We have fast-tracked a review into the entire curriculum. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  There are schools that need more money. They're called public schools, and there's not a cent for them in this bill, the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. In public schools, one in five teachers is dipping into their own pocket to buy things like food or equipment for their students, but they don't get any support from this bill. In public schools 45 per cent of teachers are helping them buy things like clothes and toiletries, but they don't get a cent from this bill. Under this government's funding formula 99 per cent of public schools will be funded less than the Schooling Resource Standard by 2023, while 100 per cent of private schools are going to be above that benchmark, but this bill gives the private schools more money and gives nothing to the public schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to have a country where everyone is entitled to a good-quality education, where our educators get paid properly and where, when you go to school, you have proper equipment in proper buildings, we need to fund our public schools. This government can find $3.4 billion so that schools that are already doing alright get even more money, but public schools get nothing. This government is failing the 2½ million children in public schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to go back to basics here. We need to say that in a country like Australia every child has the right to a decent public education. Public schools are not a safety net; they are the gold standard. We should fund them as such. But what we know from report after report and inquiry after inquiry is that our public schools are slipping behind. Why? Because there is a cashed up lobby of very wealthy schools that is able to come here and persuade both sides of the aisle that they deserve special treatment. As a result, every time there's an additional pot of money to be handed out, it doesn't go where it's needed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public schools are the ones who educate our most disadvantaged students. They're the ones who need more support, so if there's a spare $3.4 billion going, let's give it to our public schools, because they're the ones who are doing the bulk of the teaching and the bulk of the teaching in the areas of need. This has been reported time and time again, but it seems that in this place need doesn't count for much; what counts is whether you've got the right school tie and you went to the right very wealthy private school that has a few swimming pools and tennis courts. If you do that you can come and ask the government for additional money, and they will give it to you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some positive steps in this bill, because it starts to go some way towards improving the measurement of a school's socioeconomic score. In my electorate, where we've got more public housing than any other electorate in Victoria, there are some Catholic schools that I wouldn't say are wealthy by any stretch: St Joseph's, St Michael's, Holy Rosary. Some of those schools are looking after and educating some of the neediest and poorest students. But what the government is doing is wheeling out some of those schools and saying, 'This justifies the whole bill.' Well, no—part of the problem there is that we don't fund schools on the basis of need. The government hands over big cheques and then the money doesn't find its way to the schools that need it. If we had a proper needs based funding system, then those schools who are educating some of the most vulnerable, including those in the flats in public housing in Collingwood or Kensington in my electorate, would get the funding that they deserve. If you took a needs based approach, what you would find is that the bulk of the money would go to the public schools, because that is where the bulk of the need is.</span>

                    </a>  And the students. That is exactly right—and the students. That is where the need and the students are, but that is not what this government is doing. Although the government accept that there's a problem with the funding model that they've got, and say, 'Maybe we need to look a bit at socioeconomic scores,' what this bill doesn't do is consider the existing wealth and assets of private schools in allocating the funding. The idea that this is about redressing some kind of imbalance is completely wrong, because, even if your public school has enormous assets and enormous wealth, that won't be taken into account. You can still line up for some of this extra $3.4 billion. What the president of the Australian Education Union said is absolutely right:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This draft bill locks inequality into school funding. It takes no account of a school's income, wealth or assets in determining private school funding levels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, just think about this for a moment, if you've got a couple of tennis courts and a swimming pool and equipment that many, many students and people will never ever see in their life, you can still line up for a share of this $3.4 billion and get some of it, even if you've already got a lot, while other public schools, where one in five teachers is dipping into their pocket to buy stationery and classroom equipment, get nothing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just an attack on students and families and public school teachers across the country; this is also an attack on democracy, because this is another step towards us becoming a society of haves and have-nots, where if you've got the cash to send your child to private schools to the tunes of tens of thousands of dollars a year, then you're going to get more money, but, if you're lining up for a public school where you sit through sweltering days during summer, as the climate crisis gets worse, because so many of those schools aren't designed well enough to keep the students or the teachers or the staff cool, or if you're one of those students who's lining up and you can't afford to buy breakfast that day, there is nothing in this $3.4 billion for you. This bill increases inequality. It makes inequality worse and it puts us on the road to becoming a US-style society, where the gap between the haves and the have-nots grows. If there is a spare $3.4 billion going, give it to the public schools first, alright? Give it to the public schools first. And yes, if there are—I'll repeat what I said before—some non-government schools that are educating the genuinely needy and vulnerable, like the ones who educate some of the students from the flats in my electorate, then under a needs based formula they would get funding too, and they wouldn't have to queue up behind some wealthy schools and hope that there are crumbs left over for them at the end. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this was only one bill it would be bad enough, but this comes on top of other insults from this government. Government funding for private schools has grown by 35 per cent over the 10 years to 2017-18, while funding for public schools has only grown 11 per cent. Annual per student growth in total government funding for private schools was 3.4 per cent compared with only 1.5 per cent for public schools. We are not giving the money where it is needed. This is why only a few weeks ago parents right around the country were getting invoices from their public schools for fees that often were called 'voluntary fees' but in some cases in some schools they're getting invoices for things called 'essential education fees' that can run into the hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. For public schools, why is that happening? That is happening because the government is not funding schools properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a chance for the government to say to all those parents who are having to pay school fees to send their kids to public schools, 'We will give the money to public schools instead so that public education in this country is genuinely free.' So long as we refuse to give the money to the public schools—when you do things like charge fees at public schools, that impacts even more on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. They're the families who are going to be less able to stump up the cash for it. They're the parents who are going to have to make heartbreaking decisions like, 'Can I afford to pay for my child to go on an excursion or to pay for something that's called a voluntary fee?' knowing full well that, in many instances, if you can't pay that you feel the stigma as a parent. You feel the stigma, and you don't want your child to be treated differently. The public schools know this is going on and they bend over backwards to help. This is why teachers are dipping into their own pockets and principals are scrabbling around trying to find extra money. Meanwhile, the public schools are falling down around their ears in many instances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a proud product of public schools at the primary and high-school level. I tell you what, the first time I walked into a wealthy private school and saw that there were things like big tennis courts and indoor pools at some places, and they have gym departments with higher budgets than the whole of some public schools, my head exploded. But that is what's going on in this country. This bill makes it worse. The only way that we are going to remain a strong democracy where everyone gets an excellent quality education and the only way that we are going to enshrine public schools not as the safety net, as this government thinks, but as the gold standard that they are, is by funding them properly. That is something the Greens will always defend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose this handout to schools, many of whom don't need it, when there are public schools waiting in line in dire straits. For as long as a public school teacher has to dip into their own pocket to pay for food for a school student and for as long as parents sending their kids to public schools have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in voluntary fees for an education that should be free, we will oppose $3.4 billion being given to schools that have already got tennis courts and gyms coming out of their ears. That money should be going to the public schools that need it. If we had a proper needs based system of funding, then even non-government schools like those Catholic schools that educate some of the poorest in our country would stand to benefit and wouldn't have to wait in line behind those very wealthy schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key part of the Green New Deal that I will be pushing as leader of the Greens is genuinely free education in this country—getting rid of those public school fees that parents have to pay, ensuring that every teacher is paid properly and ensuring that every public school has the money it needs to deliver and continue to deliver a gold standard education. If there is money going, it should go where it is needed first. You have to ask why it is in this country, when there are students that are still going to school hungry, when there are parents that can't afford to send their kids on excursions, because the fees that are being charged are too high, and when teachers have to dip into their own pockets to make ends meet that we are handing out $3.4 billion, on top of the previous $1.2 billion that this government cut in special deals, to anyone other than the public schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know what the other parties are going to do on this, but I can tell you the Greens will be fighting it, because the Greens will fight for public schools and put public education first, because, so long as public education is underfunded in this country, which on any measure it is, that is where the money should be going first. This is taking us down the road to becoming a US-style unequal society where we divide between haves and have-nots. One of the good things about Australia is that no matter how much money you've got you can feel guaranteed that your child is going to get a good education, a world-class education, when you send them to a public school. But that is under threat if we keep underfunding our public schools. If we want everyone in this country to have the right to send their child to a public school and know that they'll get a gold-standard education then we've got to fund our public schools properly, and that means giving this $3.4 billion that apparently is going begging to the public schools who need it, not to the very wealthy private schools which don't.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Last month was Ovarian Cancer Month. Ovarian cancer is a very serious cancer. In fact, if you are diagnosed with it, you've got about a 45 per cent chance of living beyond five years. It's a very sad thing, indeed. I am wearing this magnificent teal pearl necklace today, made for me by Carolyn Bear. A number of years ago, Carolyn's daughter, Kylie, who was a psychologist studying for her PhD, died of ovarian cancer, at the age of 34. Since that time, Carolyn and her husband, Rob, have dedicated every spare minute to raising money for cancer research generally and ovarian cancer specifically. Carolyn has raised, along with Rob, over $200,000 from threading pearls, beads and crystals to make beautiful jewellery, and trinkets too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to Carolyn and Rob: thank you. I am so sorry that you weren't able to become a grandmother and a grandfather through your beautiful girl, Kylie; she was taken from you too early. But I stand with you as a parliamentary ambassador for ovarian cancer. I will wear this beautiful piece of jewellery that you made for me, and we will fight together to see that more funding is put into research so we can save more women from this terrible and insidious disease.</span>

Noosa Boardriders Club received $7,750 towards a new jetski to help them train and run competitions, and I congratulate Ryan Taylor and his committee on all that they do. Andrew Dick applied for almost $7,000 on behalf of the Cooroy Golf Club to raise awareness and restore native vegetation. These are all great projects, and I'm proud to support them all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  Yesterday was a sad day for journalism in Australia. After 85 years of providing newswire, subediting and photography services to media companies and consumers across our nation, the Australian Associated Press, AAP, has shut its doors for good. As the Leader of the Labor Party said yesterday, this is a tragedy for our media diversity and democracy. The Australian public will be less informed as a result of this decision, and I think that is a great tragedy. It's with the greatest respect to all news desks that I say this: the AAP has been everywhere. No politician was ever safe. Every time you stuck your head up, no matter what the platform was, the AAP would be listening. We need more voices in the public debate, not less, so losing 180 journalists will leave a silence that will be difficult to fill.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left, I'd like to acknowledge the work done by the successive AAP correspondents who have been based in the Northern Territory, and in particular the current correspondent, Greg Roberts. Greg has spent 12 years of his 19-year journalism career with AAP. Greg, thanks for your commitment over the last two decades to journalism in our nation, particularly your work with the AAP. I hope you stay in the NT. I spoke on Monday about proper funding of the ABC, and AAP's demise makes it even more important that we fund the ABC. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  This Sunday marks International Women's Day, with events being held across Australia to celebrate the achievements of women and promote equal opportunities for women across the globe. The third Central Coast Festival of Women is currently underway, with a number of fantastic events running until 22 March, all celebrating the lives and contributions of women in my community while promoting this year's theme: each for equal. The Central Coast International Women's Day Expo, held annually as part of the festival of women, will be hosted at Westfield Tuggerah on Saturday 7 March. There'll be over 20 stalls showcasing a number of businesses and community organisations who are all actively involved in promoting women's participation in the community. I'd encourage people right across the Central Coast to pop on down and see the great work that these organisations do firsthand.</span>

I look forward to attending again this year and hearing from guest speaker Dr Emma Beckett, a molecular nutritionist from the University of Newcastle. Dr Beckett is a researcher and a science communicator who focuses on nutrition myth busting and empowering the public to interpret nutrition research.</span>

The underpinning of a civilised world is not only Australian domestic law but also international law. The International Criminal Court was set up to deal with war crimes and crimes against humanity. We were one of the first signatories to the treaty that established the court. The third most recent country to join the treaty was the State of Palestine. The ICC prosecutor has spent five years in a preliminary investigation looking at allegations, including that Israeli authorities have settled Israeli civilians into Palestinian territories, a clear breach of the Geneva Conventions; that Palestinian Security Services in the West Bank have committed torture against civilians under their control; and that there has been criminal behaviour by both the Israeli military and Palestinian armed groups. The prosecutor wants to prosecute these alleged crimes. Given the territorial complexity, the pre-trial court has sought submissions to determine whether it has jurisdiction. The Australian government, along with only five other governments, has indicated it does not think that the court has jurisdiction—not because there are no crimes to answer but because we do not recognise Palestine as a state. I ask: why did Australia feel it necessary to make this observation and risk the capacity for the ICC to consider these possible crimes? Why should Australia not leave the umpire to do its job?</span>

ASPI's team conduct research on foreign affairs, defence, cyber and national security issues to produce work that keeps Australians better informed. Their latest report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Uyghurs for sale</span>, led by Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, is an important contribution to our national debate. This report investigates how the Chinese government has facilitated the mass transfer of Uighur and other ethnic minorities to factories across China. I quote from the report:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Under conditions that strongly suggest forced labour, Uyghurs are working in factories that are in the supply chains of at least 83 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony and Volkswagen.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This report estimates that more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This report exposes a new phase in China’s social re-engineering campaign targeting minority citizens, revealing new evidence that some factories across China are using forced Uyghur labour under a state-sponsored labour transfer scheme that is tainting the global supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The companies listed should conduct immediate and thorough investigations of their factories and supply chains in China and enforce changes where they find problems. Australians can be grateful for this sort of public interest investigative journalism and reporting, and I commend ASPI to the House.</span>

I coached local netball teams for a long, long time and, of course, as a mum, I was the team manager for the footy team, I was the scorer for the cricket team and I was there on the sidelines arguing that I couldn't score basketball but would happily team manage. Every person who has ever volunteered in local sport is offended by this government. They're offended that this Prime Minister has his hands involved in what can only be seen as a misuse of public funds for his own use. And yesterday, we became aware that there's a notional $2 billion fund for bushfire relief but that people, like the member for Macquarie's people, who have been hurt by these bushfires are not getting their fair share.</span>

The government are being completely lacking in a constructive approach to this, and it stands in stark contrast to the way they look after themselves in this place.</span>

Associate Professor Tom Shakespeare is a radiation oncologist working in the Mid North Coast and northern New South Wales local health districts. His team has published a world-first evaluation of a revolutionary radiation therapy that has left patients cancer free after two years. This evaluation looked at the effectiveness of a new prostate cancer treatment using a scan to detect tiny deposits of cancer in patients' lymph nodes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, the diagnosis of prostate cancer which had spread to the lymph glands was not good. However, modern advances in radiation therapy and PET scan imaging mean that men can now be offered targeted, curative radiation therapy. Professor Shakespeare said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time, men can be treated with the aim of totally eradicating the prostate cancer within both lymph nodes and the prostate.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evaluation followed the first 46 patients from the Lismore, Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour areas treated using this new technique and found that, two years following radiation therapy, all patients were cancer free. This is fantastic work. I congratulate and thank Tom Shakespeare and all of his team.</span>

We're buying 30 per cent of everything we consume, just about, from China. If we bring something in from China now, it can have coronavirus bacteria on it. Even if it's a steel cabinet, it may have coronavirus on it. It comes in in ships manned by Chinese people or put on the wharf by Chinese people in China. So suddenly you can't get all this cornucopia of largesse that you were going to get through your free market system.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I put a Facebook post out the other day stating how important it is that we look after people in remote and Indigenous communities, because the coronavirus's effect on them will be exacerbated by their remoteness and their lack of contact with even basic facilities such as a doctor's surgery. One of the responses I got on Facebook was someone saying: 'Wrong. Their isolation is their greatest protection. Outback and rural communities have very low likelihood of transmission.' This is absolute rubbish. They are, and we see in reports now, the most vulnerable in our community and we should be doing everything within our endeavours to help them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to note that 23 members of the parliament of Iran have contracted coronavirus, and we should be very mindful of that. We should have a protection mechanism in this parliament to deal with it so we don't have the spread of the virus. We also note that in South Korea, at a certain church, it was exacerbated by the close connection of people, and, by reason of them yelling, they said there was wide spread of the disease. That is, for me, question time. We've had Boris Johnson saying that we should be concentrating more on our capacity to work at home so as to create a greater capacity of social distancing to reduce the affect. These should be taken into account here. Might I say that, if you have a fatality rate of around one per cent, out of the 151 people in this room, that means we're going to lose two of them.</span>

AAP is not a household name in the same way some of our newspaper titles and journalists may be, but it's the AAP journalists and photographers who provide so many of the stories and photos that we see in those papers and online. As a former journalist myself, I know that AAP journalists are often the ones who are at the court first, who stay through the entire parliamentary hearing or attend that hard-to-get-to community gathering. I want to say thank you to all of the AAP journalists and I am so sorry that you are losing your jobs. This isn't just terrible news for you. It's terrible news for all of us. We need credible, professional journalists and news outlets to combat the rise of misinformation, to hold our governments and institutions to account and to help us understand what's going on every day in our communities.</span>

Make no mistake: this is a serious threat to our democracy. And, yet, this government is asleep at the wheel. It's failed to respond seriously to any of the recommendations from the ACCC's inquiry into digital platforms. It continues to mount ideological attacks on one of the most important news outlets we have—the ABC. It allows journalists' homes and workplaces to be raided by Federal Police. This is critical. Wake up before it's too late.</span>

This was Australia's deadliest cyclone in our recorded history. It claimed the lives of an estimated 410 people. Mahina ranks among the most intense cyclones ever observed in the Southern Hemisphere, and is almost certainly the most intense cyclone ever observed off the Eastern States of Australia. And in a 1899 a cyclone also caused the largest storm surge on record, when a 13-metre storm surge at Ninian Bay, adjacent to Barrow Point, extended inland for three to five kilometres. As evidence of the cyclone's power, at Flinders Island researchers found 13 dead porpoises 50 feet up a cliff, hurled there by the wind and waves. </span>

It's showcasing photographs taken throughout the fires by RFS members and community members, and it's on there for a couple of weeks. I encourage people to see it. </span>

Blue Mountains Wildplant Rescue Service were there, WIRES, the Volunteer Hub and many others were there. It was a fantastic community event. Our RFS brigades have been holding very important healing events for our community—Tennyson, Kurrajong Heights and Grose Wold all had things had on at the weekend. </span>

There was a promise of $76 million for tourism funding, and we now know $25 million of it's going to Queensland. We really need this government to keep its promises to bushfire affected communities. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me great pleasure to rise this afternoon to pay tribute to the mighty Cairns Taipans, who are one win away from making the NBL's grand final. What a difference a year makes, after the Taipans picked up the wooden spoon last year. With 16 regular-season wins and finishing third on the table, the Taipans will head to Western Australia to take on the Perth Wildcats for a spot in the decider. Our Taipans have had a marvellous season under NBL Coach of the Year Mike Kelly and superstars DJ Newbill, Scott Machado and rookie Kouat Noi. In fact, DJ Newbill was named the best defensive player in the recent NBL awards in Melbourne, and Scott Machado picked up the fans' award for MVP. At the club's gala awards ceremony recently, Scott Machado was named the Taipans' Most Valuable Player—rightfully so. Other award recipients on the night included Cameron Oliver, the members' choice MVP. Jarrod Kenny won the players' player award. DJ Newbill picked up another gong for his defensive prowess and Kouat Noi received the commitment to continue award. The coaches award went to Fabijan Krslovic. The Taipans are firing on all cylinders at the moment, and the whole city is behind them for game 3 on Wednesday evening. If the Taipans are fortunate enough to make the big dance, it will be a massive and very timely boost for our community</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  This government's never found a public fund that it doesn't want to rort. We've just seen even more evidence of that this week, when we learned exactly what happened with the Environment Restoration Fund. More than two-thirds of the initiatives under that fund went to Liberal or Liberal-target seats. Of course, most of the rest of them went to National or as-yet-unallocated issues. In fact, if you had a look, you'd find only three out of the entire 55 initiatives were exclusively in non-LNP or LNP-target seats. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fund that should be going towards helping Australia to protect threatened species, to manage the risks to our environment and to protect our diversity. But, instead, it's being used as an election-winning fund by a Prime Minister who's never seen a public fund that he didn't want to mistake for his own LNP campaign fund. This is a Prime Minister, and this is a government, that's never seen public money that it didn't want to confuse for its own. It's a government we've got right now that is spending money—whether it's from the Urban Congestion Fund, whether it's from the Environment Restoration Fund or, of course, the most egregious of all, the sports rorts fund—with an eye to the political outcome, not the public good. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the environment space, we've had a situation where, in the middle of a national ecological crisis following the bushfires, this government have been incredibly slow to get money out to the ground. And no wonder: they're too busy micromanaging how to rort funds and not looking at the big picture. That needs to change. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Each time, thousands of homes and businesses have been without power. No power means no phone and no internet as telco infrastructure relies on the electricity grid. Most recently, the February storms left many parts of the electorate without power for days on end. Businesses couldn't open and the local economy ground to a halt. Many residents continue to be without phone lines and some still have no idea when they'll be restored. And now, just this week, a tree fell and took out power in Brooklyn. It took over 12 hours for the power to get up and going again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Running a business, completing school assignments and managing day-to-day life without power, internet and phone just aren't possible in 2020. In recent days, I've met with Telstra and NBN to talk about how they can improve the resilience of telecommunications in my electorate. I've also written to the council and the minister responsible for Ausgrid and urged them to reconsider their tree management policy. The balance between protecting trees and protecting homes, businesses and essential services is out of whack. We can't stop lightning from striking and we can't silence the wind, but we can remove hazards from around power poles and phone lines, and people should be able to remove hazards from their own property.</span>

With the closure of AAP the latest example of the fourth estate in strife, the ABC is ever more vital to the health of our democracy. Anyone who saw Leigh Sales's interview with the Prime Minister last night knows that this government needs to be held to account. The bushfire crisis this summer demonstrated just how vitally important the ABC is and why it needs to be properly resourced. Every day, the work of ABC staff in the press gallery in this building ensures Australians know what is being done in this place in their name.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I often spend my weekends in the parks and reserves of Chisholm, be it the weekly park run I attend or when I walk to the shops through my local park. However, when I do this, I'm always saddened by the senseless rubbish polluting my community's parks. I know I'm not the only one that is upset about rubbish in our green spaces. Last weekend thousands of volunteers participated in Clean Up Australia Day and spent their Sunday cleaning parks and bushland. These volunteers picked up cigarette butts, broken glass, plastics and anything else causing harm to our environment. I spent my day with some great people and organisations like the Blackburn Lions and their youth counterpart, the Leos. We were down at Blackburn Lake Sanctuary cleaning up the wetlands. I especially want to mention councillor Denise Massoud of Whitehorse City Council, who was my pick-up buddy for the day.</span>

It is because of people like them that our parks will be free of rubbish. I cannot wait to join everyone next year for Clean Up Australia Day—but, hopefully, there will be a little less to clean up!</span>

The Prime Minister was asked about his habit of misleading the Australian public when he is under pressure, a pattern of behaviour we've seen on issues like his secret Hawaii holiday, the Brian Houston affair, the City of Sydney forged document imbroglio and the sports rorts scandal. The PM dismissed all of this as 'minor matters'. Truth and integrity are never minor matters for anyone, let alone a Prime Minister. Trust, accountability and democratic accountability are not minor matters for anyone, let alone a Prime Minister. As Einstein said, whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be entrusted with important affairs. This is a Prime Minister who can't be straight with the Australian public. The Australian public deserve better. They deserve a Prime Minister who they can believe the word of.</span>

The reality is this: in the most recent national accounts, for the December quarter, growth was 0.5 per cent. That was better than market expectations. It saw through-the-year growth to 2.2 per cent. In the quarter before the December quarter was the September quarter. What was through-the-year growth then? 1.8 per cent. The member for Rankin is the only person who thinks that 2.2 is below 1.8. The reality is that through-the-year growth increased. The IMF, as recently as January of this year, said the Australian economy will grow faster this year and next than the United States, than Canada, than Japan, than Germany, than France and than the United Kingdom. The member for Rankin fails to understand that when Labor was last in government unemployment was 5.7 per cent, and today it is 5.3 per cent. The member for Rankin fails to understand that household disposable income in the last six months of 2019 had its biggest jump in 5½ years. The member for Rankin fails to understand that the Australian people want lower taxes, not higher taxes, and there's only one side of this chamber that can guarantee lower taxes. That's the coalition under this Prime Minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:03</span>):  Thank you very much to the member for Wentworth, who, having served Australia in the most distinguished way on the international stage, is well aware of the importance of global events and the connectedness of Australia—the fact that we are not immune but we are always prepared, as we are now. In particular, in the latest advice, I can now inform the House that over 92,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed around the world. Particularly with a country like Iran, however, we know that that is likely to be a higher figure because there are unreported and undocumented cases. We also know that there are over 3,100 lives that have been recorded as having been lost and that it has now transmitted to 78 countries and regions around the world, including Argentina, Morocco and Ukraine for the first time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I mentioned Iran. We moved early on Saturday, ahead of most of the world, indeed the vast majority of the world, in putting in place a travel ban. Events of the last few days have indicated that that was the right decision but that the situation in Iran is likely to be even more comprehensive than had been understood by the world previously. As a consequence of that, following the Prime Minister's request to the chief health and medical officers yesterday, they've been looking at high-risk cases and recommended, and we have implemented the decision, to require all people in Australia who have been in Iran and arrived in Australia since February 19 to self-isolate. This has been taken as an important and precautionary measure, particularly given that the number of cases in Australia that have an Iranian connection has now increased to 10. Domestically, the Australian cases are at 41, including the 10 with an Iranian connection. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most concerning is that NSW Health identified overnight that a worker from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge, an aged-care facility in Macquarie Park within the electorate of Bennelong, has been confirmed to have coronavirus. Eleven residents have been isolated. Tests are being conducted on one patient who is in hospital and another 95-year-old former resident who very recently passed away. As that material becomes available, it will be provided. What is important to understand is that on identification, both NSW Health and the facility immediately implemented the steps that had been planned, agreed and prepared. As a consequence, the best possible protection for the residents is being put in place. I want to thank all of them, but I indicate that this is a case of planning, preparation and implementation to protect Australians.</span>

As he knows, the global coronavirus is a very dramatic situation that has been emerging now for these past several weeks. It is a situation which the government has moved quickly on to protect the health of Australians. Equally, we have been moving to fully understand the economic impacts of this very significant event. This health crisis is different from others that we've seen before, whether it be SARS or MERS, and that has been confirmed to us in the advice we've received. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic impacts of this virus are significant. We have seen a global financial crisis before, some 12 or 13 years ago, but the economic impact of this crisis is very different to what we saw in the global financial crisis. There is not a failing of the Australian financial system or indeed the global financial system. There are not the same sorts of issues that went to credit flows in the economy at that time. Importantly, the previous global financial crisis had a very muted affect on the Chinese economy, and the Chinese economy during the GFC proved to be extremely important to the Australian economy at that time. So there are very real differences between the circumstances we face today and previous circumstances. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all very significant and serious issues, and that is the way the government is approaching it in fashioning the responses we will be providing. We will continue to ensure that we do everything in the government's power to not just address the very serious health affects and the risks to the Australian population, as we have been doing, but also address the very real and very significant economic impacts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this health crisis is doing is disrupting supply chains. It is disconnecting travellers from where they would have otherwise gone. It is disconnecting exporters from their markets. It is disconnecting and disrupting the global economy. We will engage with that and we will be doing it from a position of strength, as the Treasurer just outlined. We will be pursuing policies that are responsible, that are targeted and that will get the best possible outcome for the Australian people.</span>

This is a global issue. Australia is not immune from the global health crisis of the coronavirus, but we have got ahead and we are staying ahead, and we are working together with everyone around this country who wants to work with us to achieve that task—and I thank state and territory governments. I also thank the four major banks who we asked to come to the nation's aid in passing on whatever rate cuts were provided by the Reserve Bank—which is part of the response that is being provided to this global health crisis and its economic impacts. So I thank the banks for following the lead of companies like Qantas and others to address the very real economic situation that we are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But today's national accounts show that we have entered this crisis in a strengthening economic position, with through-the-year growth up from 1.8 per cent to 2.2 per cent in the December quarter. That is compared to G7 nations. Only the United States had slightly higher growth than Australia through the year to December. Indeed, in the December quarter we had the same growth as the United States and higher growth, by 0.5 per cent through the year, than the OECD average and two and a half times, or thereabouts, of what the average growth was in the OECD nations in the December quarter. The national wages bill is up by 5.1 per cent—the strongest growth in 7½ years—and average compensation per employee was at a growth rate which was the highest we've seen in five years.</span>

That is why we need no motivation other than the reality that we understand: that we know we need to take action on climate change. That's why we took to the last election the plan and the commitment to a 26 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. Those emissions have now reduced by 13.1 per cent on 2005 levels. That's stronger than we've seen by other countries like New Zealand and Canada. We have a plan and a commitment, which we put to the Australian people, to meet that target by 2030. In relation to the member's question, while the government is taking action to 2030 and is making great progress to achieving that target based on our plan, those opposite do not have a 2030 view about emissions reductions that they can actually share with the Australian people. Not one!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  Yes. I'll say there are two issues there. It's very similar to a point of order I've just ruled on. It did have a specific question, but it also referred to the question last week. Whilst I haven't memorised it, I remember you raising a point of order on that, and my point was that had a long preamble. But I do say to the Prime Minister it didn't ask for alternatives either.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the member again for her question, because the question probably would be better put to the Labor Party, who do not have a 2030 target. They want to talk about 2050, and they can't even tell you what they want to happen by 2030. Let me tell you what we're going to do by 2030 and what we're going to do by 2050. What the government is doing is putting a technology road map, which is what you need to ensure that you can reduce emissions not just now but over the next 30 years to address the very issue that the member has raised. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, those opposite have a 2050 target. The member herself may have a 2050 target. She may have a 2050 target and the Labor Party has a 2050 target, but I'm not aware of either the member or the Labor Party having a plan as to how to achieve it. What we have is a plan to reduce emissions not just now but into the future. A key part of our plan is to reduce emissions without putting a tax on Australians, without putting up their electricity prices and without undermining the industries and the jobs that so many members on this side of the House represent in their constituencies right across this country. I'm not going to sell out the jobs of those constituents who depend on those industries. We're going to, recognising that to take action on climate change is necessary, get emissions down by the smart process of having a technology plan that sees us reduce emissions into the future. We've got a plan. It's focused on technology. They've got a target, and all it means is higher taxes.</span>

What we saw through the year was 2.2 per cent growth. That was up from 1.8 per cent through the year growth for the September quarter. This puts to rest the falsehood spread by those opposite that the Australian economy was softening at the end of last year.

It says on page 415 of this book that Swan's senior adviser, Jim Chalmers, captured the mood. He said: 'He captured the mood when he said, "The media sell in the budget lock-up was easy—back in black." We had the member for Rankin running around the budget lock-up talking about being back in black. The reality is on this side of the House we have delivered the first balanced budget in 11 years and more than $300 billion of legislated tax cuts. Unemployment has fallen from 5.7 per cent under Labor to 5.3 per cent today. Under the coalition the economy will continue to be stronger.</span>

He has a background in local government, he is a strong supporter of Australia's tourism and transport sectors and he makes a valuable contribution in this place. Today's national accounts showed that the Australian economy continues to grow. We are in our 29th consecutive year of economic growth. No other developed nation has had a run like we have had. We got through the global financial crisis; we got through the Asian financial crisis. We got through the dotcom boom and bust. We have seen in today's national accounts a 0.5 per cent increase in growth for the December quarter. We have seen growth increase to 2.2 per cent through the year to the December quarter, compared to 1.8 per cent through the year to the September quarter. Household consumption contributed to growth today. We saw an increase in 13 out of the 17 separate categories in relation to consumption. Importantly, five out of the seven discretionary categories also saw an increase. We saw net exports contribute to the growth number today. We saw public final demand, government consumption, increase by 0.7 per cent in the quarter. Importantly, ownership transfer costs, which are a window into housing activity, were up by 12.3 per cent over the December quarter. And, for those members in this place with mining companies and mining sites across their electorates, we saw a five per cent increase in mining investment. And machinery and equipment increased in December by 0.9 per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked about international comparisons. I can inform the House that just yesterday the OECD singled out Australia and Germany as two countries which could respond to coronavirus with additional fiscal measures without endangering debt sustainability. We also know that the IMF, as recently as January, was saying that the Australian economy will grow faster this year and next than the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, France and Germany. Today, employment growth is 1.9 per cent. That's nearly twice the OECD average and nearly three times what we inherited from the Labor Party. We know that in the December quarter we saw growth greater than the OECD average—greater than the euro area, greater than Canada, greater than the United Kingdom. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Reserve Bank governor, the fundamentals of the Australian economy are very good. Australians can be confident about their economic future. Only the Labor Party will talk down the Australian economy and only the coalition can be trusted to create more jobs and to lower taxes.</span>

I don't know why the member for Rankin never lets facts get in the way of a good headline. I don't know why the member for Rankin ignores the most recent numbers in today's national accounts, such as the fact that we have seen unemployment come down at the end of last year, in December, to 5.1 per cent. We saw it go down. We saw retail sales volumes have their biggest jump in two years. We saw, in the September quarter, household disposable income have its biggest increase in a decade, on the back of our tax cuts—and, if you combine it with the December quarter, you see that household disposable income had its biggest increase in 5½ years. We've seen the housing market stabilise. We've seen prices rise, but we've also seen clearance rates increase. And the Reserve Bank, through monetary policy and the initiatives that we have undertaken on the fiscal side, have also contributed to a stronger housing market. The reality is we have legislated through this parliament, against the will of those opposite, more than $300 billion of tax cuts. We have seen, on our watch, more than 1½ million new jobs being created. We have seen the first balanced budget in 11 years. We have seen the lowest welfare dependency in 30 years. </span>

We have delivered more jobs, we have delivered lower taxes, and Australia is in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth. We're one of only 10 developed economies in the world to have a AAA credit rating from the three leading credit-rating agencies. That is why the Australian people backed us at the last election—because they can trust us with the economy. The member for Rankin talked about the top end of town and ran around with the member for McMahon promising higher taxes. Only the coalition can deliver a stronger economy with lower taxes and more jobs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:35</span>):  I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The member for Flynn has been here four terms; this is his fourth term. The people of Gladstone, Emerald and surrounds have sent him to do a job for them, because they trust him. They know how industrious he was when he was delivering fuel to all those outposts, to those businesses. He wasn't one who picketed out the front of a small business; he worked for them. He made sure they got the delivery of the fuel supplies, the diesel and everything else, because he is a businessperson. He understands business. He understands when business has the back of the government then the economy is doing well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning the urban infrastructure minister and I wrote to our state counterparts to bring forward projects of significance, be they large or small, to get them fast tracked and to help the economy. For those projects, in between three and six months, we want to get shovels in the ground and excavators busy. We'll do it as part of the $4.2 billion bring forward that we announced last November, and for Queensland that's certainly going to be beneficial. It complements the existing $26.3 billion that that state was receiving as part of the $100 billion 10-year infrastructure rollout.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've expedited $118½ million for the Roads of Strategic Importance. There's a section of road which runs from Townsville to Roma. That $118½ million is going to be so beneficial for that particular stretch of road. The crucial supply road carries 56,000 trailers transporting cattle and 46,000 trailers transporting retail fuel annually, of which the member for Flynn knows all too well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $40 million Springsure to Tambo project is really important. Sealing of this route will cut eight hours off the trip and save cattle producers up to $1,400—that's $1,400 that goes straight on their bottom line. When you're a businessperson trying to make ends meet as best you can, $1,400 is a lot of money. It's good for the cattle industry and it's good for the transport industry. The member for Flynn knows this all too well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mayor of the Central Highlands Regional Council, Kerry Hayes—he's a good bloke—said, 'Belief in our region: as a freight route and tourism corridor, this link, talking about the Springsure to Tambo route 'is critical to the economies of the central highlands and western Queensland.' He understands it. He understands how important Roads of Strategic Importance are. He understands how important it is to get product sooner and safer to where it needs to go. The member for Flynn, he gets it too. We, on this side of the House, get it. We understand infrastructure. That's why we're rolling out $100 billion of infrastructure over the next decade. Regional Australia and Central Queensland are certainly a large part of that, because when the regions are strong so too is our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank the member for her question and her ongoing efforts in her electorate in relation to the bushfires, as I do acknowledge the efforts of all members across this chamber for the support they've provided in those communities so terribly affected by the bushfires. But I have to correct the member on some of the matters that she's raised in her question and the misrepresentations made in her question. Of the $2 billion that were committed as part of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and the fund that was established for that—there was $2 billion—and the phasing of that expenditure was $500 million in this financial year. I can confirm, as was confirmed at estimates, that some $205 million of that $500 million in this financial year, which was phased to be spent this year, has already been spent. We're in the first week of March. We committed these funds two months ago and we've spent $200 million already in the last two months. $500 million is the allocation for this six months to 30 June. I can go through them: $21 million in education support; $7 million for volunteer payments for rural firefighters; financial counselling support of $5½ million; emergency relief funding of $25.6 million, a mental health package of $10.4 million; a primary industries grants program that has already rolled out $43.5 million. $2.9 million has been provided under small business disaster recovery grants. This is the program where we need to rephase the program and re-engineer it based on the feedback we've had on the ground. In tourism domestic marketing we have already been able to provide, together with local area grants, $62½ million; and for wildlife and habitat recovery some $26.6 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we go specifically to the primary producer grants in New South Wales, I can confirm that there has been $39.2 million provided to 672 applicants for grants under the primary producer program. In the small business grants, as those opposite know and as was the case whether it was Cyclone Yasi or the North Queensland floods or any of these other disasters, including bushfire disasters, in order to be eligible for small business grants there needed to be direct damage caused by that physical activity such as that fire event. That is the same rule that is applied on both sides of the House when these grants have been considered. The nature of these fire events has produced a different effect in these communities. That is the feedback we've got on the ground. The minister for emergency management, myself and former AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin, working together with people like the member for Bega, Andrew Constance, have been working on a revision to that program. I look forward to making announcements addressing those issues that have been raised. The government will continue to listen carefully and will continue to make changes to programs as necessary to deliver that support as needed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Prime Minister formally approached the states and territories and asked them if they had infrastructure projects that they could bring forward in order to get construction and more jobs going more quickly. As a result of that, late last year we announced $4.2 billion worth of either new money or money which we could bring into the forward estimates that otherwise was not. That has enabled significant projects to get going now which otherwise would not have been underway. For example, next week we'll be formally starting the construction of stage 2 of the Monash Freeway Upgrade. I note that the member for La Trobe is particularly interested in this. This is a $1.3 billion project which will support 1,000 jobs. This will begin next week. It's only able to begin because of the decision which we made late last year to add a further $184 million to that project, which enables the construction to get going and those thousand jobs to kick off and get going immediately. </span>

The North East Link is another massive project which will be able to get underway this year because we've brought forward money in relation to that—similarly with the Gold Coast Light Rail Stage 3A in Queensland, the Tonkin Highway over in Western Australia and so many other projects. Again, we are going back to the states and territories. The Deputy Prime Minister and I have again formally approached the premiers and the infrastructure ministers at the state level, along with the councils, to say to them, 'Are there further projects that they can bring forward to get going in the next three to six  months?' We want those projects to get underway. We want to partner with our delivery agencies, be they state and territory governments or local councils, to get those projects underway. If you do, it means more jobs, it means a stronger economy and, of course, it enables people to get home sooner and safer. It's all part of our $100 billion plan, which we on this side of the House are delivering.</span>

She is a champion for first home buyers not just in her electorate but throughout South Australia. Since the re-election of the Morrison government we have seen a sustained improvement in the Australian housing market. We have seen sustained confidence improving in the Australian housing market. Pleasingly, that is being driven by first home buyers, who are confident in the economic plan of the Morrison government. It's also worth adding that, without the spectre of Labor's housing taxes on the agenda, confidence has rushed back into the market. Part of that though is our very successful implementation of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. From 1 January, 10,000 first home buyers—</span>

On this side of the House we understand that one of the biggest challenges for first home buyers in purchasing their first property is getting that deposit together. In fact, in Melbourne it has been taking up to eight years for people to save for their deposit; in Sydney, up to 10 years. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time—1 January, when the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme was launched—we have had 7,031 first home buyers sign up. Very pleasingly, the Prime Minister, the member for La Trobe and I had the wonderful opportunity to meet some of those 7,000 first home buyers just a few weeks ago. In fact, the Prime Minister and I met Lisa and her two beautiful primary school children. She told us that, by participating in the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, she estimates that she was able to buy her first home four years ahead of when she would have otherwise. It was wonderful meeting Lisa and her family. There are thousands of those stories around the country.</span>

Throughout Australia there are 7,000 people able to get into their first home because of the work of the Morrison government. It is bringing forward their purchase by many years. There are 27 lenders who offer guaranteed loans. There are two large banks and 25 smaller lenders to make sure that this gets coverage across the country.</span>

Australians can be reassured that our government has been on the front foot in responding to this disease and the challenges that come with it. We haven't waited to respond; we've taken practical steps to ensure that we are in the best possible position to respond to the very serious challenges of this outbreak of coronavirus. There has been a very coordinated response from this government that includes responses from Health, responses from Border Security, responses from Trade, responses from Foreign Affairs and, of course, responses from Industry. This is a situation that requires daily assessment, and it requires ongoing action. Australians should be assured and reassured that we are in the strongest possible position that we can be to deal with this very serious challenge. That's because, over the years, we have done the hard yards that have been needed, including investing in our science and research agencies, which are world leaders in infectious disease study and control. What this has meant is that we are in a position to lead when it comes to finding a suitable vaccine. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday I indicated to the House that we had been in close consultation with the international body that has been tasked to develop the vaccine. Our contribution has already been significant. We were the first to grow the virus outside China and we've shared this with other world researchers. We have developed a promising vaccine, and that vaccine candidate is currently undergoing testing at CSIRO's state of the art facilities in Victoria. CSIRO has been on the frontline of biosecurity and infectious disease research for 100 years. Infectious diseases previously unknown in humans have been increasing steadily over the last three decades, and more than 70 per cent of these emerging diseases are being passed from animals to people. Reducing the threat of infectious diseases and improving our biosecurity protects both our community—all Australians; everyone who's here—and our farming industries. We've been investing in this for many years over successive governments, and it's an investment that we can be proud of. It means that we are now in the strongest possible position to deal with this very serious issue. </span>

What I can say is that just as our scientists and researchers are serious about what they are doing, this government is serious about what we are doing to protect them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:02</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Today the sports minister told Senate estimates that he met with two staff from the Prime Minister's office at 6 pm last night to discuss how to handle questions about sports rorts. Did the Prime Minister know before or after that meeting that the parliament had been misled about the sports rorts list sent to Sport Australia on the day the election was called? Can the Prime Minister confirm that his office is coordinating the cover-up?</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, to the point of order: I'm not aware of any precedent which would prevent us asking about the office of the Prime Minister trying to cover something up. This exact issue about false information having been provided to the Senate has been the subject of discussions in a committee in the other place, and to follow up the direct role of the Prime Minister's staff in it—it would be a very new precedent, I suspect, if this were not in order. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I'm just going to say to both the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business that, whilst the language in the last part of the question is not desirable, I think there are many precedents for it. The reason I was considering it was whether it was really going to an allegation of criminality or anything which would have to be moved by substantive motion. I've got a long memory and I'm almost certain—I'm happy to check—that this term has been used a number of times over a number of issues, including back to 1993 and 1994. That's my recollection. I think the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> would reflect that. So, the question is in order. The Prime Minister has the call, but I point out there are a number of questions there, not just the last bit I focused on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  I thank the honourable member for their question. In the member for Herbert we have another fighter for the north on the coalition benches. I'm asked about the resources sector, and under the coalition's stable economic management the sector is absolutely booming. It is providing essential economic contributions. It's generating opportunities for current and future generations. By the numbers, there has been $33 billion of investment in 2018-19, accounting for 27 per cent of Australia's total private business investment. There are 245,000 jobs in Australia, one of the fastest-growing sectors in our economy. Weekly earnings, on average, are $2,600 a week. That is a significant and substantial contribution, more than double the average of full-time weekly earnings across the country. We have a resilient resources sector. We have mature markets, we have quality products, and they will continue to be shipped right around the world because there are markets in need that are desperate for what we supply from this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of words that make the opposition very uncomfortable. It makes them squirm in their seats. They move around. They look at their phones. The first one of those is coal. I will say it again. Coal employs 54,000 people in direct jobs in regional areas, and we know those opposite simply don't support it. It contributes $6 billion in royalties—$6 billion towards schools, hospitals and roads. What a significant contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of whether it's critical minerals, coal or other sectors and resources, the other word that makes them uncomfortable is Adani. Those opposite didn't support Adani, but this is a business which is expanding. It has already got $750 million worth of contracts announced. That is supporting existing and new businesses in Central Queensland. The Adani mine already has 200 workers on site, and 22 per cent of those, according to Adani reports, are for Indigenous workers. What a contribution to the Australian economy that those opposite did not want. We stand with the resources sector; those opposite do not. We stand with the workers in Australia in the resources sector; those opposite do not. We stand for expansion and economic growth; those opposite do not. I have probably been a bit unkind to those opposite. I know there are a few of them that might support the resources sector. They might meet once a week at the Otis restaurant.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker, but it is important to recognise, when we compare and contrast, that we stand for resources. Those opposite do not.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Today we got the national accounts, which were a report card on those opposite in the last three months of last year in the economy. What they showed was that economic growth in the last quarter of last year was slower than the quarter before. Economic growth had slowed. It showed that growth was once again well below average and well below trend. It also showed that growth is a full percentage point lower than it was before the Prime Minister and the Treasurer took up their roles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at those numbers, you see the slowing in growth; there's the private economy which didn't grow at all in the quarter; consumption growth at its slowest pace since the GFC; total private business investment going backwards for the third consecutive quarter; wages growth was really weak and it slowed even further in the December quarter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad we were able to ask the Treasurer about this in question time today, because when we asked him about all of these things, all of this weakness across the board, the good news is that we were wrong. There was one indicator that the Treasurer was able to point to. He said that ownership transfer costs are going really well. Wages are weak; growth is slowing; business investment is horrible; household debt is horrible; the budget is blowing out; debts are more than double; but the good news is that ownership transfer costs are going great guns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of you in the House who had to google ownership transfer costs—including me—you will discover that ownership transfer costs are actually lawyers' fees. The bad news is that the economy's growing slower; the bad news is that wages can't keep up with the cost of living; the bad news is that household debt has gone through the roof and public debt has more than doubled; the bad news is that we have a productivity problem and an investment problem; but the good news is that the lawyers are getting paid more fees than they were in the quarter before. The quarterly growth in legal fees is going great guns. Well done to the Treasurer of Australia—that is terrific! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that these numbers today absolutely torpedo the farcical argument from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that the economy was going well before the coronavirus hit. As ANZ has just said, as the NAB has just said, that these numbers today show that the economy was weak before the virus hit. Unsurprisingly, despite all of this weakness throughout the economy, the Treasurer got up and gave a statement earlier today and he now expects a big pat on the back. He gives himself a big pat on the back for these numbers which are out today. That isn't terribly surprising. The Treasurer is the kind of guy whose team can get dusted by 100 points and he will declare himself best on ground. Every single workplace in Australia has someone like that, and unfortunately the Treasurer of Australia is the one in our workplace. He's always very keen and very pleased with his own performance. What his spin and his grin always try to obscure, but never fully can, is that there has been weakness in the economy for some time. All of us represent communities and are in touch with our communities, and we understand that people feel, with some justification, that no matter how hard they work, they just can't keep up with the rising costs of child care or electricity or health. They're finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The data bears this out as well. It's true that every single quarter under this Prime Minister and this Treasurer has shown annual growth below trend, below average, in the economy. They are yet to have an outcome in any quarterly number while in their roles that shows at least average growth in the economy, let alone better than that. That speaks volumes about a long period of significant economic mismanagement and underperformance on their watch. We gave the Treasurer two opportunities today to stick by the thing that he has said hundreds if not thousands of times: 'Back in the black, back on track.' We asked the Treasurer twice to do that today, and he was unwilling or unable to do that. It's almost like they've forgotten those mugs that they were flogging off for $35 plus $4 postage. Everyone who bought one of those mugs should get their money back. We weren't the ones who printed the mugs. We weren't the ones that made that commitment for them. That's their commitment. If they fall short of that commitment, it will be on them. When we asked them about 'back in the black' in particular, they say, 'No, we said something else.' But the mugs didn't say 'back in beige', did they? They said that the budget was back in the black. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that we are entering a difficult period in the economy, and I think all of us have acknowledged that the challenges associated with the coronavirus and the government's response to that serious and significant challenge means that our economy will be impacted. We've been up-front about that all along. Given we've been up-front about that, the onus is on the government to now admit, given the numbers that came out today, that we enter a difficult period from a position of relative economic weakness, not strength. Growth is slowing, unemployment is rising, and debt's more than doubled in the budget—most of the debt in there is actually Liberal debt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So those opposite are about to get tested. They are about to be tested by a significant event in the economy. There will be an impact, and we've said that—the leader's said that and we've all said that at different times. It remains to be seen whether they are up to it. But what we already know is that, in their third term now and in their seventh year, they have failed all of the tests that they have set for themselves. They said at election time, 'We promised to make the economy even stronger.' Instead, it got even weaker. They said they'd have a surplus in the first year and every year after that. They're none for six, and we don't know whether they will be none for seven. They said they'd pay down debt, and instead debt has more than doubled and they've abandoned their commitment to pay it off, even over the next 10 years. So, on all these measures that they asked us to judge them on—they said judge us only on this; there's very little else that they asked to be judged on—they have failed the test that they set themselves. They are failing those tests they set for themselves, and they're about to be tested again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This coronavirus is the kind of test that the Treasurer won't be able to grin and spin his way out of. He will not be able to network his way out of this. The economy doesn't grow on self-congratulation, unfortunately. All these things that the Treasurer is a gold medallist at will not help Australia and Australian workers, businesses and communities through a very difficult period. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that there have been three consecutive decades now of continuous economic growth, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister today, 'Will this three-decade run of unbroken economic growth survive Scott Morrison's Prime Ministership?' and the Prime Minister was unable to say that it will. I think that speaks to a deeper truth. When this side of the House was tested during the darkest days of the global financial crisis—we were over there, then—we passed with flying colours. I don't know about the rest of the colleagues, but I am tremendously proud of what Australia was able to achieve—Australian businesses, Australian workers, Australian communities—when we banded together, working with each other, under the leadership of Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan and the whole cabinet and the whole Labor Party. We are tremendously proud of what we achieved during the global financial crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite can pretend all they like that that wasn't a golden period in economic policy success for this country. The rest of the world recognises that what Australia was able to achieve during that period was something special, and it is something that every Australian business and every Australian worker should be very proud of. Every time that they seek to diminish that achievement they seek to diminish the achievements of workers and communities and businesses, who stuck together in a very difficult period and did the right thing by each other and, in doing that, did the right thing by the economy and the country more broadly. They can do all they want to diminish that. They're about to be tested. It will be not as big a test as the GFC, most likely, but they are about to be tested. It remains to be seen whether that three-decade run of unbroken economic growth will continue under those opposite. As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned in his question, that 30-year period of unbroken economic growth originated under Labor and it was saved by Labor when it was at maximum risk. They are now the custodians of that 30-year period of unbroken economic growth. It remains to be seen whether they'll be up to the test.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it's what we saw in the national accounts today, what we've seen in the economic data since the election or what we've seen over three terms and seven years of negligent inaction and incompetence on the economy, the Australian people can have very little confidence that those opposite are up to the task and up to the test that's about to be set for them.</span>

But, then again, they're not serious people.

Australia recorded its third consecutive current account surplus in the December quarter 2019, the longest consecutive period of current account surpluses since the 1970s. Given I was born in 1981, that is a long period of time for sure. Let me go through some of the facts. Let me go through some of the facts that are really inconvenient to those members opposite, particularly the member for Rankin.</span>

Through the year, growth picked up from 1.8 per cent to 2.2 per cent. We're growing faster than the OECD average and faster than any G7 economy except for the United States. But jobs are important, and this is a government that is committed to jobs for Australians. In compensation of employees, the nation's wages rose 5.1 per cent over the year, one of the strongest results in 7½ years and above the decade average. The average compensation per employee grew three per cent, the strongest result in over five years and, again, above the decade average. In 2019—</span>

More than half of those jobs were full time and more than half were taken up by females. Our jobs growth in 2019 was almost double the OECD average and faster than any G7 economy, including the US. In 2019, average unemployment was 5.2 per cent. That is the lowest calendar year average since 2011. The participation rate hit a new record high of 66.2 per cent in August 2019.

We are on track and we are meeting record lows. Cost-of-living pressure is something that we're concerned about on this side of the House, unlike those opposite, and that also eased in 2019.

Our plan for a stronger economy is about building resilience in the economy. It's about rewarding aspiration. It's about lowering taxes so you can keep more of what you earn. It's about reducing the cost of doing business, whether it be energy, deregulation, finance or getting paid on time. It's about equipping Australians with the skills that they need that Australian businesses also need. It's about expanding trade to access more markets and create more jobs. It's about building the infrastructure we need for our economy to grow. It's about keeping our budget strong to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on but also to make sure that we're prepared to deal with the challenges they face—those real challenges that are now of concern to Australians.</span>

The irresponsibility of those opposite to talk down the economy, to put fear into the minds of Australian families and workers is shameful.</span>

When those health issues are addressed, this government wants to make sure that we bounce back, and our plan is about ensuring that Australian businesses and jobs and the economy bounces back as strongly as it can. The interim economic assessment from the OECD has already revised Australia's growth in line with revisions to global growth and growth across the G20. The OECD is forecasting that the Australian economy will grow faster than the economies in the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2021.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to dealing with the coronavirus, when we compare reckless approaches to our economy, we can also look at Labor's reckless approach to our economy in relation to their 2050 emissions targets. They have not learnt at all from the mistake at last year's election. Their target is without a plan. It's like saying you want to go somewhere but you don't know how to drive the car or you don't know how to put petrol in it—probably not the best example to use in relation to this debate. However, it's perhaps like getting in an electric car and going for a long drive, knowing there is nowhere to charge that up along the way. But it is completely irresponsible for those opposite to set a target for 2050 when they can't even agree between themselves on what their 2030 target is and how much that will cost. It is completely irresponsible of those opposite to set a target without being honest with the Australian people about how they'll get there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're at it again because all of the signs point to their secret carbon tax. There they were with a CSIRO report, supporting their target without a plan. The CSIRO report they were holding up modelled a $273 carbon price to get to zero net emissions by 2050. Now, you don't hear them talking about their secret plan for a carbon price of $273. The Leader of the Opposition failed seven times to rule out a carbon tax. The members for Hindmarsh, Corio, Hunter and Grayndler all failed to rule out a carbon tax last week. I challenge those opposite, those speaking after me: stand up; rule out the carbon tax; be honest with the Australian people on what your real road map is to achieve net zero by 2050. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will reduce emissions by investing and supporting technology, not by taxation. We know that the only solution those opposite have when presented with a problem, whether it be about reducing emissions or dealing with natural disasters, is tax, tax and tax. There is no better evidence that Labor and those members opposite, and in particular the member for Rankin, cannot be trusted. They cannot be trusted with managing the economy, particularly at times when the Australian people need us the most.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr STEPHEN JONES:</span>
                  </a>  I withdraw. Why couldn't he tell the truth about where he was? Why did he have to dissemble? Why did he have to mislead people? Why couldn't he tell the truth? I make no criticism of the fact that the Prime Minister might like to invite friends to the White House for a special dinner. I make no criticism of that. But why on earth could he not tell the truth? He was asked time and time and time again: did he do it? But he couldn't tell the truth. He couldn't tell the truth. We're seeing it again with the sports rorts affair. He's been asked time and again: what was his office's involvement in the sports rorts affair?  If you can't tell the truth about the small things, how on earth are the people of Australia going to trust you about making the big calls on the things that really matter? He promised us a surplus. He told us we were 'back in black', and now we know that he won't meet that promise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have learnt that this Prime Minister likes to make big promises and likes to talk a lot about plans. The previous speaker had a lot to say about plans. They're very good at talking about plans, but they're hopeless—absolutely hopeless—at delivering on them. They had a plan for a surplus that turned into a marketing plan for coffee cups and T-shirts. They won't meet it, and they know it. They had a plan to look after the bushfire communities of the South Coast of New South Wales. The Prime Minister missed the first chance, stood in this place and said: 'We've got a plan to look after them. We're going to look after the recovery. We're going to look after the clean-up of the devastation. We're going to look after the businesses that have been affected.' But now we know that less than 10 per cent of the notional fund that's been set aside has been spent. We have heard time and time again about their plans for energy. Well, they've had plenty of energy plans. They've had 19 of them! Unfortunately, power prices are still going up and so are emissions. So, when these people talk about plans, you know one thing: they will never meet them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are trying to tell us that we've never had it so good and that the economy is going great guns. The test for the strength of this economy is not what this Treasurer or this Prime Minister is saying about it; it's what business is actually doing. It has never been easier for a business to invest. It's never been cheaper for a business to get access to capital. Interest rates have never been lower. Wages—tragically—are very, very low as well. Wage growth is as flat as it's ever been. Interest rates, inflation—all low. It's never been easier for businesses to invest. But what's happening with business investment? It's down 1.4 per cent over the year and 20 per cent since they got into government. Don't listen to what that mob is saying about the economy; look at what business are doing. If business had any confidence whatsoever in that mob's ability to manage the economy, they'd be investing. It's never been easier to invest, there's never been a better time to invest—but they have no confidence that that mob is going to manage the economy in the interests of business. And they know that, if they cannot trust the government on the little things, they certainly cannot trust them on the big calls. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, tragically, we've got some big calls to make, and we are calling on the government to act and to act now. We cannot wait, because, every week that they delay, the economy goes backwards. The Australian people need a message from this government. They need a plan from this government, they need it to be implemented, but they're certainly not getting it. The people of my community are demanding some action, and business is demanding some action, and all they're getting from this Treasurer and this Prime Minister is coffee cups and marketing plans. Frankly, the people of Australia deserve much more than that. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  Deputy Speaker, imagine someone who calls themselves an economic conservative, someone who comes to government on the basis that they've promised they'll be prudent, responsible and keep the budget in balance. And then imagine that the first chance they get, rather than delivering on their plan of being prudent and responsible, they tear it up and embrace the opportunity to spend, spend, spend and take no responsibility. Let's imagine somebody like that. You'd have to say they're either a hypocrite or a fraud, or both. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then sometimes they go even further and they invent their own economic concepts in the process. You may have heard, Deputy Speaker, of the broken window fallacy. Well, there are Labor Party members who believe in the 'burning down the house fallacy', because what they did when they were previously in government, when they came to government on the basis that they were economic conservatives, was go down a pathway of spending recklessly, tearing down school halls and rebuilding school halls to generate economic activity. They literally invested in burning down the houses of Australians as a pathway to show that they were, allegedly, economically conservative.</span>

The member for Goldstein, I'm listening very closely to what you say, and any direct comments to the opposition are unparliamentary.

                  </a>  So we'll go through and highlight the absurdity of many of the claims that are made by opposition members in this chamber and the programs that they sought to implement. Some members have talked about the tragic human consequences—I couldn't agree more—that occurred on the basis of reckless, reckless policy. For members opposite to come into this chamber and lecture members of the government, who have delivered year-on-year economic growth, sustained economic growth, and, against the backdrop of the drought and the fires, have continued to deliver strong economic growth, is outrageous. The reality is that in the last quarter of last year, despite the headwinds of the droughts and the fires, we have been able to continue to deliver.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not pretend otherwise. We are facing very difficult economic circumstances. As the assistant minister said at the dispatch box before, we know that a health crisis is turning into a significant economic challenge for the Australian people. It is because we are exposed as an economy to many of the countries that are directly affected by the coronavirus. It is going to affect our supply chains. We face the very real challenge where many businesses have willing customers but not the stock, where service based businesses want to sell but are reliant on things like tourism and struggle to be able to get customers. These are the challenges that we're responding to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for us is: what choice was before the Australian people at the last election? They made a choice about the type of prudent and responsible government they wanted, one that could come into this chamber and pass a budget which cut taxes and empowered Australians to continue to support the economy, for small businesses who invest to be able to build the future of this country. Or the alternative, of $387 billion worth of new taxes that was proposed by the opposition. They made a choice because they knew what drove the fundamentals of the Australian economy and put us in the position to respond to exactly these types of crises, to make sure that we're in the position so that we can respond in a targeted way to keep jobs and businesses open to grow this nation— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I'm happy to talk about the MPI on the government's longstanding failures on the economy. I thank my good friend the member for Rankin for bringing this into the chamber. I thought I'd start with a quote from the great economic genius from the Liberal Party, then shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey, in 2013. This is back when interest rates were 2.5 per cent. I'm an English teacher, not a maths teacher, but I reckon that that was higher than 0.5 per cent. That is my understanding. This is what he said when asked by Leigh Sales about the Reserve Bank cutting rates:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If anyone thinks that the Reserve Bank acted today because the economy is doing really well, and Labor's doing a terrific job running the economy, they'd be deluding themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, what do we see? What did we see the Reserve Bank do yesterday? They cut interest rates by 2.5 per cent, down to a new record, record, record, record low of 0.5 per cent. Half a per cent! Capital hasn't been this low since the Sumerians first set up a bank lending service. Capital could not be lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we see the Reserve Bank doing this? Well, Joe Hockey is like a stopped clock; he eventually gets something right. It's because there's something wrong with this economy. I know that there are headwinds. We know that the coronavirus is going to cause significant challenges for our economy. I know that because I talk to the businesses in my electorate. I'm sure the member for Rankin does that. Every good member talks to retailers. But there were problems in this economy long before anyone had heard of the coronavirus. We know that. When I had my meetings with community leaders, particularly those who work in the education sector or the migration sector, and even just walking around the shops, I knew that retail was in trouble. I know that families are saying they are doing it tough. Families are talking about childcare costs, saying that wages aren't keeping up and jobs are insecure. We see all those other indicators. I'm not talking down the economy, I'm just stating the facts. Business investment is going backwards. The member for Ryan is laughing about it. Business investment is going backwards. Go and talk to the people in your electorates.</span>

                  </a>  We've seen three consecutive quarters, nine months, where business investment has gone backwards. Labour productivity is pretty much the No. 1 indicator for whether the engine of the economy is ticking over right. If you get a sound in the motor, where productivity isn't working, you know that there's something fundamentally wrong. We've seen it declining for a long time. Net debt has more than doubled, gross debt has risen to over half a trillion dollars and has doubled under the Liberal and National parties. Let's not forget that. This is an economy of their making, as we settled into the seven wasted years now of a coalition government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the 'black summer' was difficult for Australians. We know that the coronavirus will add additional challenges for tourism in Queensland—or tourism all around Australia, I should say—and on the number of international education students coming here, who are such a boost for my electorate in particular. All of these challenges mean that we need a government to step up, and what do we have? The person who drives this—I've seen treasurers up close. I worked with Wayne Swan. I've seen what he's like as a human being. I understand why internationally recognised people say that Wayne Swan was cometh the hour, cometh the man. Cometh the hour, cometh the man! He stepped up and was able to work with the opposition at the time. I will stress that: the opposition leader at the time did work with the government for a while, in terms of recognising the dire straits. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  What an embarrassing performance from the member for Moreton. We shouldn't expect too much more, but it's disappointing nevertheless. When Labor have to hold up Wayne Swan and his panic and his cheques to dead people as an example of what we should be doing, you know that they have really lost the plot. It was a perfect example of the difference between the Labor members opposite and this government. On that side of the chamber, they're so busy talking down the economy. They can't accept the facts and they're busy pointing back to their spiritual hero, Wayne Swan. 'Oh, the glory days!' they think. They're so desperate to go back to those glory days, but the fact of the matter is that this nation is dealing with some serious challenges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I talk to the families in my electorate of Ryan, and they say to me: 'With the serious challenges that this economy is dealing with, that this nation is dealing with—bushfire recovery, coronavirus—thank goodness the coalition government are the ones that won at the last election. Thank goodness that they're busy dealing with the issues that matter to us and our families rather than Labor, who are pining over their political games in this place, who are so busy calling divisions that they can't even think up questions about the major issues that are facing our nation, like coronavirus. Thank goodness that the Australian people aren't saddled with $387 billion worth of new taxes as we go into these important issues that we have to deal with as an economy.' It is just incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the Australian people are resilient. They are incredible people. They bond together and they help those who are doing it tough. We are about supporting them as a resilient nation, and we can do that because we have a budget which is back in balance. We have tax cuts for 10 million Australians, despite Labor trying to stand in the way of that. So we've got more people with more money in their pockets based on their spending priorities, not Labor's spending priorities. What we don't have is $387 billion worth of taxes. That's how we deal with the bushfire response. That's how we deal with the coronavirus response. That's how we deal with the drought response. They acknowledge these things, but Labor members will only acknowledge it through gritted teeth. They'd like you to think that these things are just small issues: 'Don't worry about those. The more important issues are invites to the White House and email trails over here.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the important things to the people of Brisbane, to the people of Ryan, to the Australian people, are making sure that this nation recovers from the bushfires and the drought crisis and making sure that they get through the coronavirus with a resilient economy. When it comes to doing exactly that, what's important is the facts about our economy—facts that Labor do not or will not acknowledge. Australia has entered its 29th consecutive year of annual economic growth. The IMF is forecasting Australia to grow faster than the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and the UK. This means that, as far as you can be prepared for something like the coronavirus, Australia is in a better position than those other comparable nations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have brought the budget back to balance for the first time in 11 years. We have maintained our AAA credit rating. We are one of only 10 developed countries to maintain our AAA credit rating. Employment growth is more than three times what we inherited from Labor. Under this government 1.5 million jobs have been created. It used to be that the Labor Party was the party of jobs. No more—they have well and truly given up that mantle. They have given it up willingly, because they are too interested in pandering and responding to Twitter than they are in looking after the workers of Australia. We take a completely different view. We believe that we are here to support the Australian people by getting them into a job. We have done that to the tune of more than 1.5 million jobs created. Earlier this month the RBA governor himself said that Australia's economic fundamentals remain strong and provide a solid foundation for us to be optimistic about the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  We've seen low wages growth; people aren't getting a pay rise; there is low business investment; businesses are crying out for this government to support them; people aren't spending at our shops, restaurants and cafes, and now we've got an interest rate cut to emergency levels. This was all happening long before bushfires and coronavirus. Businesses and communities are being hit hard because this government won't act. Labor's been crying out for stimulus. We've been warning you that you can't rely on monetary policy alone—warnings that you've ignored. In fact, today all we've had is some bad theatre efforts from the member for Ryan and a lot of 'you've never had it so good' from the rest of the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are suffering because of this government's approach to managing the economy. There's no growth, because they've failed as economic managers. They're looking to other sources to try and prop up their surplus. But it's not a surplus any more, is it? I'm a bit unsure: is it still 'back in the black' or is it 'balanced'? I'm not sure what we're up to today. It's not a surplus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who do Liberal governments always target when they're looking for more money? They target the most vulnerable. So we have a $1.6 billion underspend in the NDIS—money that should be supporting people with disability is instead sitting there to make their budget look better than it is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lest you think this is just some kind of Labor attack, let me share who's raised concerns about this government's approach. It's none other than the New South Wales Liberal minister Gareth Ward, who, together with his Victorian minister, wrote to the government to express his concern at their approach. He said, 'I want to make sure that money doesn't sit in a bank account offsetting the Commonwealth's budget, which is what it's doing.' He said, 'I want to see it improving the lives of people, and that's what it's not doing.' Last weekend, in between our weeks here, I went home to my electorate and held a mobile office in the suburb of Greensborough. The No. 1 issue that people raised with me was the struggles they are having with the NDIS. Parents talked to me on behalf of their children whose plans aren't working, who aren't getting what they need. Parents are worried that when they die their children won't be okay. What an indictment of this government's economic approach, that it would rather prop up its ailing budget with an underspend on the NDIS, that it would put those families through that worry rather than spend the money when it's needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we're seeing this approach of targeting vulnerable people not just when it comes to the NDIS. We also saw it through robodebt—the stress and the hoops they made people jump through, which we now know were illegal. We see it in the way they are reducing and outsourcing staff at vital services such as Centrelink. I can't tell you how many older people have walked into my office or have walked up to me and said how they've been stuck on the phone for ages, they don't know how to get through the Centrelink blocks and that all that happens is they're told to go and sort it out online—and I'm sure many of the members on this side share my experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has ripped $3 billion out of the trades and training sector. In Jagajaga, that means that apprenticeships have dropped by 17 per cent. The conversations I have with people around that are with mums and dads who are worried about their children's future. They worry that their children aren't going to be supported to get the skills they need, that they face a future of uncertain and unstable jobs and that, despite what we heard from the Assistant Treasurer in question time today, their children will be renting into their thirties. Those are the economic conditions that people are facing today—uncertain jobs, low wages, low wage growth, and struggling to get into their own homes. They are the economic conditions that this government is presiding over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course we do know that there is one area where the government are not afraid to splash the cash—and that's when it comes to their own re-election. We know that there is not a grants program that they are not prepared to rort. There is not a spending in that that they are willing to let go. They can underspend by $1.6 billion in the NDIS but, when it comes to grants programs, they are happy to shovel that money out the door—and they are certainly not shovelling it to Labor electorates. They are being very clear about where that money is going: it's going to support their re-election. What a disgrace! The Greensborough Hockey Club in my electorate had an application for $500,000. They were rated 89 out of 100, but they were denied. You are a disgrace!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  How the opposition can have the audacity to make the claim that the government is failing in economic management is beyond me. The Morrison-McCormack government is fostering a strong economy by building resilience and rewarding aspiration. Australia has just entered its 29th consecutive year of uninterrupted economic growth, which is an outstanding achievement that even those opposite must appreciate. This was achieved in the face of ongoing international trade tensions, numerous natural disasters and the persistent drought in regional communities such as Mallee. The leadership shown by the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Treasurer and Minister for Finance has allowed this government to deliver the first balanced budget in 11 years, in spite of the disastrous mismanagement that was left to us by the Labor Party. Australia has also recorded its third consecutive current account surplus in the 2019 December quarter, the longest consecutive period since the 1970s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this government is lowering taxes, supporting business and industry, creating jobs and helping people get into those jobs, investing in infrastructure and creating educational opportunities for our young people, all while maintaining a responsibly managed budget. The national accounts today show that the Australian economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter and 2.2 per cent through the year. The International Monetary Fund is also forecasting that the Australian economy will grow faster than the economies of the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, both in 2020 and 2021. In December last year, unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent. The last three months of jobs data have beaten median market expectations, with around 80,000 jobs created. On average, over the past 12 months, a record 74.5 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 64 had a job.  Since coming to office, this coalition government has created over 1.5 million jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also very encouraged by the government's $585 million investment in the Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package to help train highly skilled and qualified workers, particularly in regional areas such as Mallee, to meet the needs of businesses. This package increases the number of apprentices by up to 80,000 over the next five years. This package helps towns in my electorate, such as Charlton, fill their workforce needs and support local businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of owner-occupier loan commitments to first home buyers increased by 6.2 per cent in December to 21.3 per cent higher through the year. First home buyers now make up 34.9 per cent of total owner-occupier loans, well above the 10-year average. The Australian economy has fostered a strong housing market in my electorate of Mallee. Of almost 60,000 occupied private dwellings in my electorate of Mallee, 42 per cent are owned outright and 30 per cent are owned with a mortgage. These statistics from June 2019 demonstrate that the favourable conditions of Australia's economy are encouraging people to buy their own home and that housing prices in my electorate are affordable, with the average mortgage around $1,000 a month. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Opportunities for investment that will strengthen our economy are numerous and varied. That's why the government has developed its $100 billion 10-year infrastructure pipeline. It's also why the government is making investments in new technologies that will be essential for lowering our emissions, such as solar, wind and hydrogen. My electorate of Mallee has enormous potential to generate power through solar technology, and investments in new developments are occurring rapidly in the region. For example, Kerang is home to Victoria's first large-scale farm and battery storage. Developments like these are taking place around the country because investors have faith in the coalition government's economic management credentials. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage, we know that the economic impact of the coronavirus is highly uncertain and difficult to quantify, but unexpected shocks like this are exactly why the coalition government is committed to sensible economic management. Through the leadership of the coalition government, Australia is ready to deal with the challenges presented by the coronavirus from a position of strength. Evidence of the coalition's strong economic position is expressed in the following realities: we have passed over $300 billion in tax cuts, created more than 1½ million new jobs— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I'm going to go out on a bit of a limb here, because we've heard a lot about how this government don't have a plan. I think that's a little bit unfair, because I think they do have a plan. They've got a plan for handing out taxpayer money for political purposes. They've even got spreadsheets—colour coded spreadsheets. That's a plan! They've got a plan for fundraising. They've got a plan for marketing. I still can't get over the fact that one of their mugs was $35, although I did see some toilet paper advertised on Gumtree for $35 as well!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, they had a plan for a surplus, but they've kind of let that one go. I mean, they have plans. They have political plans. They have pork-barrelling plans. They have dinner plans. What they don't have is an economic plan. That's what they don't have. They have no plan for the economy. After seven years of this government, they're still standing up and talking about Labor. After seven years of this government the economy is floundering. What do they want to do? They want to blame the coronavirus. The Prime Minister said that the coronavirus is a health crisis with economic implications, but he was at great pains to say there is no problem structurally with the stability of the economy or things of that nature. Well, I'm going to use a quip that I'm quite familiar with: denial is not a river in Egypt! </span>

                  </a>  That was a good one! They want to blame the virus for the state of the economy. But let's take a look at the economy before the virus. Just recently the RBA cut the interest rate for the fourth time.</span>

                  </a>  As the previous speakers have noted, it's at an all-time low of 0.5 per cent. It's the fourth interest rate cut. I note that the member for Goldstein is interjecting. He would know this because he's the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Economics and presides over these issues. He would know it's the fourth interest rate cut, right? It's another interest rate cut that is not going to stimulate the economy, because if the last three rates didn't stimulate the economy, this one's not going to stimulate it either. People are going to put the money they save from the interest rate cuts right back into their mortgage because people are suffering mortgage stress, because people have high household debts, because wages haven't gone up and because people don't have the funds for discretionary spending. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA has instigated this monetary policy and used its monetary levers by reducing the interest rate, but for some time now the RBA and businesses have been asking the government and we've been calling on the government to instigate some of those fiscal levers to stimulate the economy and to take responsibility for stimulating the economy instead of putting all the heavy lifting onto the RBA. We have stagnant wages, as I mentioned earlier. People are in insecure work. They have no security and no surety of work. There is underemployment and low household spending coupled with high household debt. Australia needs a fiscal policy that will restore confidence so as to get people spending. I go back to the word 'confidence' and to the use of fiscal policy to restore confidence. Here's something about consumer behaviour: people won't spend money on discretionary goods and services if they have to pay bills, if they don't know where their next pay packet is coming from or how much is going to be in their next pay packet, or if the price of their house has reduced but their mortgage is still high. People in those situations aren't going to go out and spend money in retail. People aren't going to stimulate the economy if all of those other conditions are as they are now. It is a fundamental principle of understanding consumer behaviour. At the same time, business investment is going backwards, labour productivity is denied, net debt has doubled and gross debt has more than doubled. What more evidence do you need of the economic incompetence demonstrated by this government over the last seven years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Jagajaga spoke about her electorate. I'll talk about my electorate of Cowan. I'll talk about the schools. I'll talk about the food banks. I'll talk about the shops closing down in the suburban shopping centres. I'll talk about the NDIS and the people presenting at my office every day with issues about the NDIS. I'll talk about the lack of training availability. All of these are because this government continues to fail the Australian people through having no plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I regret the amount of time I spent preparing for this MPI. Being the final speaker, I thought there would have been  a cogent economic argument mounted by those opposite that I'd have to be ready to spend five minutes rebutting. Unfortunately, I haven't got a lot to draw on. When I saw the member for Rankin stand up, I felt for him. His heart really just wasn't in it. He was thrown one of the great hospital passes by Labor's leadership when they decided this morning that they would send him out to debate the question 'The government's longstanding failures on the economy'. I suspect they were hoping that, when the national accounts were released a little later on, the economy hadn't grown as strongly as in fact those accounts released by the RBA showed: 0.5 per cent for the quarter, an increase of 2.2 per cent year on year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Disappointingly for the Labor Party, but not for the rest of the people of Australia, the economy is growing strongly. An increase of 0.5 per cent in the December quarter exceeded the expectations of the markets, and, whilst we will never be complacent or relaxed in the economic settings and policy levers that we're responsible for as the elected government of this country, I think that it is an excellent endorsement of the policy decisions of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the cabinet to get a result like that. Of course the member for Rankin had to come in here—I suppose if you haven't got something nice to say about someone, don't say anything at all—I'd describe his contribution as gentle. It was a very gentle contribution—</span>

                  </a>  It was a wet-lettuce-leaf contribution from the member for Rankin. He did make one observation which interested me when he was talking about the economic management and record of Kevin Rudd and the previous Labor government. I've read the Labor Party's review into why they lost the recent election. There are lots of suggestions in it, but one of them wasn't to promote the economic legacy of the Rudd-Gillard era. That did not come up in Labor's election review. So the fact they want to talk about and promote that period of time is heartening to those of us that want to stay in government for a long, long time into the future but is perhaps not in the best interests of a robust democracy in this country if you're not interested in moving on from the debacle of those six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the member for Whitlam, who talked about the Prime Minister's holiday, and we had the member for Moreton, who went one further than talking about Kevin Rudd. He complained about low interest rates, which reminded me of the 2004 federal election—the Mark Latham election—when we had that great prosecution argument in our campaign about just how high interest rates would be under Labor. We compared Mark Latham to Paul Keating and to Bob Hawke and to Gough Whitlam. The member for Moreton seems to think it's a good idea to perpetuate this truism of Australian politics: that interest rates will always be high under a Labor government, and that if you've got a mortgage or an aspiration to buy a home do not vote Labor, because they actually believe in high interest rates. That truism was just portrayed in the contribution by the member for Moreton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamentals of our economy are very, very strong. We are lucky that we have done the hard work over the last seven years since we inherited that awful economic legacy from the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era. We've got record trade statistics now. We've had a current account surplus for the longest period of time since the 1970s. We're investing $100 billion in infrastructure over the next 10 years. In my home state of South Australia, we have our investments in defence industry—an increase in expenditure in the budget to two per cent of GDP on defence. Of course, in the Labor era they let that go to rack and ruin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've reduced taxes and we're putting more money back in the pockets of the Australian people, because we know that they're much better at spending their money than governments are, no matter who's in power. We are giving Australians opportunity. We are setting the policy metrics in our economy so that people who work hard and take a risk will be rewarded for that. The statistics are there very clearly for all to see, and the fact that Labor have put this motion forward today, on the basis that they were hoping that our economic indicators would be worse than what ultimately occurred when they were released by the ABS this afternoon, is absolutely shameful. While you wish and hope for poor economic statistics, we will keep focusing on creating wealth in this country, growing jobs and giving a future to all of those businesspeople and families out there that we're very proud to represent.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I rise to support the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020, because every child has the right to a great education and every parent has the right to make a choice about where their child attends school. This bill seeks to enable funding that is fair and transparent and is allocated according to the needs of the school community and the child. Independent and faith based schools have always provided a choice for parents to pay for their child's education rather than attend a publicly funded state school. They should be able to continue to do so. Like our two-tiered health system, the Australian school system provides a safety net for some and choice for those who are willing to pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of this bill is that for the very first time the bill will enable government funding to be directly assessed on a needs basis. By 2029, students with the same need in the same sector will attract the same level of support from the Commonwealth, regardless of the state or territory where they live or their background. Through this bill the Australian government is introducing a more accurate methodology to calculate the capacity of a non-government school community to contribute to the cost of schooling. By creating a more targeted and directed measure of income, schools will be able to receive a fairer proportion of the funding pool and we can ensure that funding goes to the school and children who need it most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new method follows the recommendations made in June 2018 by the National School Resourcing Board review into the socioeconomic score, or SES, that funding is based on. This board was made up of members nominated by government, Catholic and independent sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, the SES was calculated using certain indicators, including the average income and other characteristics, collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the area where the student lived. This was based on the SA1 subsection of the statistical area of the ABS. This meant that the indicators were averaged using data that was not necessarily representative of the families of the children that went to the school but, rather, representative of the geographical area in which the school resided. By using a geographic area, the indicators did not build an accurate description of a specific family's ability to contribute to school fees when enrolled at an independent or faith based school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, this bill will link the funding model for non-government schools to the parental income of the families of students at each individual school under the new direct-measure-of-income score, making use of income data and other data held by the ABS. This is very important because it will enable funding to be targeted and appropriate. But the Morrison government will not just set and forget this funding model. We have put in place a number of measures to ensure that there's a transition process for schools to this new setting—and this is important. I know this because I have been chair of a faith based school council. I know how important it is, with regard to a funding model, that there is surety and that there is a transparent process so that schools can have their business plan argued out for the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This record funding that will be distributed for the new direct-measure-of-income approach will consist of an extra $0.2 billion in 2018 and 2019 for schools in the lead-up to the change, and the establishment of a $1.2 billion Choice and Affordability Fund from 2020 to 2029 to assist schools with the transition. This is good policy, this is worthwhile policy, and I fully support and endorse it. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  We know that education is the backbone of the future of Australia, and I want to make sure that we have legislation that looks after all of our students in this country so that they can get the quality education they need and deserve. So Labor will not be opposing this bill, the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020, in the House of Representatives. But I do want to put some remarks on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> today about the importance of quality education and, even more important, quality education funding. I want to make sure that families feel completely supported and that they actually have the support they need so that their kids, whether they be in public, private or independent schools, have all options available to them. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes funding changes to private schools and completely ignores our public schools. I just want to read from the second reading amendment that the shadow minister for education and training moved this morning:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll come back to that amendment in a moment. The bill itself, as we've just heard from the member for Higgins, seeks to introduce a new method of calculating a family's capacity to contribute to the cost of their child's private education, altering the way non-government school funding is allocated. This will calculate the capacity to contribute, or CTC, based on a direct measure of the income of families of students at the school, rather than on the average SES of the neighbourhood students live in. The proposed direct measure of income is a targeted, more accurate approach and should ensure funding flows to the non-government schools that need it the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had a lot of lectures from those opposite about their record amount of education funding. They believe that they should be congratulated by the community for increasing funding year on year. What the government never admit or acknowledge is that they've never matched Labor's commitment to funding schools properly in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate that Labor will not be opposing this bill today. In principle, we do support the move to a more accurate and robust direct measure of school communities' capacity to contribute to the cost of education at non-government schools. I'm pleased that this bill was referred to a Senate committee—which I understand will be releasing its report shortly—so that this bill, which makes significant changes to the education sector, receives the scrutiny appropriate for such legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation once again shows that the coalition government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, really has turned its back on every public school parent and child in Australia by refusing to properly fund public schools. The government is happy to spend $3.4 billion to deliver targeted—and this is the key word—needs-based funding to private schools, but it refuses to provide a single extra dollar for underfunded public schools. The Prime Minister thinks that the students who go to public schools and their parents don't matter. There are around 2½ million public school students—two out of three of all students in this country. Public schools teach 82 per cent of the poorest kids in Australia, 84 per cent of Indigenous kids and 74 per cent of kids with disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus on the second reading amendment and particularly highlight to the House that we're seeing results falling in reading, maths and science. My view is that a good education in a properly funded school is the right of every single student in Australia. You should have quality education no matter whether your parents choose to send you to a fee-paying school or to the local public school. We're seeing time and time again more pressures on teachers. The narrative coming out of government is that somehow it's not about funding. If you turn on Sky After Dark, you'll hear the same commentators go on about how funding isn't the answer; it's about quality and the teachers. We heard the member for Bowman say that it's all the fault of the teachers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My sister is a state school educator in Queensland. I'm very proud of her being an educator. She has been an educator for over 30 years. She has taught in schools in far western Queensland—she began her teaching career in Cloncurry—she has taught in the United Kingdom and she currently teaches year 4 at a southside Brisbane school. She absolutely loves being a teacher, and she is an amazing teacher. She's an amazing sister as well, but she really is a terrific teacher. I've obviously spoken to her for many years about her role as an educator. Like probably every other state school teacher in the nation, she knows that our schools are not being properly funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I talk to educators in my own electorate of Oxley. This morning we heard the shadow minister for education and training, the member for Sydney, explain to the House that by 2023 we will see funding inadequately distributed between public schools and non-government schools. The divide is growing. On Friday the 27th I'll be attending a farewell for a much-loved deputy principal in my community—Mrs Tracey Slingsby. I want to spend a little time in my speech today wishing Mrs Slingsby all the best. I know that she would be very proud of me speaking about funding for public schools. She is a proud public teacher who has changed the lives of literally thousands of students. Her husband, Errol, was a principal at Oxley State School. He has retired. I know all members of this House wish any teacher retiring after a distinguished career a long and happy retirement. They've earnt it. I place on the record today that the teachers I've met in my electorate—through my family, friends and the work I've done—are really concerned about the future funding of our national education system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some of the education results, which I said I would do. In the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment, Australia recorded its worst results in reading, maths and science since international testing began. Our students are facing a long-term decline. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I went through the report. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a triennial survey of 15-year-old students that assesses the extent to which they have acquired the key knowledge and skills essential for full participation in society. The assessment focuses on proficiency in reading, mathematics, science and an innovative domain (in 2018, the innovative domain was global competence), and on students' well-being.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PISA survey is held every three years to test how well students in their final years of school apply their knowledge to real-life challenges. In 2018 it was sat by more than 14,000 15-year-old Australians from 740 schools, joining 600,000 students from 79 countries. In maths, 15-year-olds performed more than a year below those in 2003; in reading, a year lower than those in 2000; and in science a year worse than those in 2006. By these measures we are currently preparing a future workforce less equipped than it was 20 years ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decline in school performance has worrying implications for long-term economic growth, with a one per cent change in literacy associated with a 2.5 per cent change in labour productivity. I encourage all members of the House to support the second reading amendment to show to our public school sector that we understand their need and, more importantly, that this House recognises that we are seeing slippage and a fall in results in reading, maths and science and that we are failing to develop a long-term education policy for the nation's economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data speaks for itself. On 4 December, when these results were mentioned, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia ranked a lowly 70th out of 77 participating nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's 2018 index of disciplinary climate, released on Wednesday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have slipped in a serious way. Australia is one of the minority of countries where it has deteriorated. That's an important part of the conversation. On the world stage, our ranking and the data that we're finding are going backwards. This should be a wake-up call to all members. Since 2003 maths performance has declined further than any other country except Finland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the current Australian education minister was asked about this, he was quoted as saying that this should be ringing alarm bells for the government. That is interesting, because he is the government, the government responsible for education policy in this country. I expected that we would have seen a direct response to this. For the first time ever, performance in maths was no better than the global average. In maths, which is clearly a key area of education, we're seeing a reduction in performance and outcomes. I don't know about anyone else in this House, but I am deeply concerned about the education plan that we are seeing delivered by this government in its sixth year and working towards its seventh year. We're seeing real results going backwards. The PISA national project manager, Sue Thomson, described the results as a 'wake-up call'. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're not giving them the skills they need in maths, or in reading, or in science. We're not giving them the same level of skills as they are in other countries. This is a concern, particularly in a global economy where our kids will compete with kids all over the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can analyse results in black and white till the cows come home, and they are all there for the world to see. What I'm calling for by supporting the second reading amendment today—the government seems happy to spend $3.4 billion to deliver targeted needs based funding to private schools, but they aren't delivering an extra dollar for underfunded schools. That doesn't sit easily with me. It doesn't sit easily with the educators that I have been meeting with since I was re-elected as the member for Oxley. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at two remarkable schools in the break. I visited the mighty Woodcrest State College. One of the greatest things we have to do as members of parliament is to be part of leadership ceremonies and watch students step up and take on the role as leaders in their school and community. I often say, 'I don't know who is more proud: the parents of the students who are receiving these great leadership roles or the teachers.' That is particularly so at secondary level. Pat Murphy, the principal of Woodcrest secondary college, was telling me how a number of his students had started from Camira State School, which is nearby the secondary college, and gone right through. So he's watched their education journey. That sums it all up. When you're seeing teachers as proud as parents it means they want the best for their kids, as we all want for kids in our community. But, time and time again, you're seeing a government not investing enough in education for under-resourced schools. I've got some great schools, such as the Kruger State School, where I attended a leadership ceremony as well. Those kids are kicking goals. The Kruger Crocs are going from strength to strength. The teachers are giving them their all and the principal is providing school leadership, but what we're not seeing is proper funding for under-resourced schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I entered this debate today. As I said, Labor won't be opposing this piece of legislation. Of course we want funding for all schools. But we're calling on the government and ensuring that, whilst their priority today in this bill is to deliver $3.4 billion for needs based funding to private schools, they simply follow that procedure for under-resourced schools in this country. We want to turn those results around. I haven't yet heard one government speaker talk about the failing results in reading, maths and science, which are there for everyone to see. What the teachers, students and parents in Australia are calling for is more funding, more action and better results. </span>

On many occasions, the precedent is that you're named and suspended for 24 hours. I'm not going to do that on this occasion, but I'm making it clear while everyone is here: if a quorum is called and you're in the House or you come into the House, you must stay. The more recent precedent is to give the warning I've given. That wasn't what happened in the 1950s. I'm not about to go straight back to it. Having now communicated that clearly to everyone—I think the member for Gorton would be wise to keep listening and ignore the member for Newcastle for a while. Having now told everybody, I'm making it very clear: if that occurs again, a naming will occur.</span>

Let me say, we on our side of the House will not be dictated to by the Australian Education Union, which are a handbrake on good education policy in this country. The Australian Education Union has opposed every good piece of education reform in this country. It absolutely amazes me that, despite the fact that there is low union density in construction and mining, we still see union density of about 45 per cent in the education sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings to a close an issue which the government has been dealing with since the time of the Gonski legislation. The Gonski review particularly looked at the issue of SES. The Gonski review had this to say about the SES:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the area-based SES measure used at present is subject to potentially significant error due to variability in family SES within Census Collection Districts. This should be replaced in time with a more precise measure that would reflect directly the circumstances and background of each student in a non-government school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this legislation does: it responds to the views of the Gonski review. The member for McMahon is sitting behind me because he agrees with what the government has done here. He agrees with what the government is doing here. He agrees that the direct income measure is very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think about many schools in my electorate which were subjected to the SES measure. They might have had people from a particular suburb or a particular postcode in their school but they weren't necessarily the wealthiest people in that particular suburb. In fact, very often, particularly in the Catholic independent school sector, they were among the poorest people in that postcode. The direct income measure creates fairness across the sector. It says that if you as a parent earn a particular amount of money that is what is going to be counted, rather than an average across a postcode or series of postcodes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation and the new arrangements mean that almost all the schools in my electorate are better off under the direct income measure—and that's terrific. Providing more support for all schools, as we are doing—going from $21.8 billion this year to $32.5 billion in 2029—means that we are supporting the choice of parents and their right to choose the education that is right for their families. In the Berowra electorate, people don't make a bad choice—whether you choose government, whether they choose Catholic or whether they choose independent. I'm lucky to have 51 outstanding schools serving 27,000 students. The teachers in all our schools are dedicated and professional, and the standard of education our children receive is extremely high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents choose schools for all sorts of reasons. For some it will be logistics and for others there are values based decisions that affect their choice. The non-government schools, who are the particular beneficiaries of this measure, are filled with families that represent the full spectrum in my community. Families who choose non-government are actually often lower-income families. The old assumptions that we used to determine the capacity to pay haven't corresponded with the actual wealth of families attending non-government schools in my electorate. I think particularly of a couple of the non-government schools, Mount St Benedict College and Oakhill College, which made particularly strong recommendations and representations to me and to the education minister about the importance of the direct income measure and what it will mean for their school and for other schools in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the non-government schools in my electorate. I have 16 fantastic non-government schools who serve nearly half of the students in my electorate—nearly 10,000 students: Arden Anglican School, Berowra Christian Community School, Lorien Novalis School for Rudolf Steiner Education, Mount St Benedict College, New Hope School, Northholm Grammar School, Oakhill College, Pacific Hills Christian School, Redfield College, Tangara School for Girls, Hills Grammar School, Warrah School, Marian Catholic College, St Agatha's Catholic Primary School, St Bernard's Catholic Primary School and St Madeleine's Primary School.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you hear some of the reasons that families sacrifice so much to send their children to these schools it is heartening to see the government supporting families in this way. One family in my electorate who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We gladly forgo oversea holidays and instead choose to go camping with our family so that we can send our children to these amazing schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone talking about Berowra Christian School said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we sought to find a school that would support the worldview and values we hold so dearly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We deliberately chose this school because it offers an education that we feel is in partnership with the way that we are seeking to bring up our children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Berowra Christian School is a small, nurturing, inclusive and academically strong school. The teachers are dedicated, loving and caring professionals. They always go above and beyond what's asked of them as teachers. The staff demonstrate incredible care and support, especially for those children with special needs, including our ten-year-old son, who has a significant physical disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to send our children to Berowra Christian School was not one we made lightly. It involved greater travel each day and also greater financial cost. But when we reflect on the nurturing education that our children have received at this school, we would make the same decision in a heartbeat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That view of Berowra Christian School is the same as that of so many parents who send their children to non-government schools. I commend the bill to the House. I think it adequately and accurately reflects the desires of the Gonski review. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020—a bill that alters the way non-government school funding is allocated, in that it seeks to introduce a new method of calculating a family's capacity to contribute to the cost of their child's private education. I state upfront that Labor will not oppose this bill, but I would advise the House to also support the member for Sydney's amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation before the chamber is a significant departure from the current funding allocation arrangements, so the Labor Party has referred this legislation to the Senate's Education and Employment Legislation Committee to ensure that it receives proper scrutiny. It would be a speedy inquiry because there is some urgency because of some GST complications. Nevertheless, we do need to have a look at it. We do need to get this right. It is important. All members of parliament would care about our children's education. I say that from my previous life before I became a lawyer, when I spent 11 years as a high school English teacher. I've always seen education as the great transformational opportunity in life. It's the wonder of Australia that we provide strong, solid education for all. It is why, traditionally, we've been a very egalitarian society. Since we've provided funding to all, whether they be in the bush or the city, all Australian kids should be able to receive a world-class education. But the change being put forward by the coalition is significant. It would calculate the capacity to pay based on a direct measurement of family income using de-identified ATO information for the actual parents at a school, rather than the average of the neighbourhood in which the students live, which is basically calculated by census collection districts data. This reform was recommended by the independent National School Resourcing Board and, before that, by the original Gonski review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this move. It provides a more accurate and reliable measurement of a school community's capacity to contribute to the cost of education in non-government schools. Currently, if there is an elite school and a low-fee school in the same neighbourhood, parents coming from the same neighbourhood would receive basically the same socioeconomic status score, even if one school takes in all the students from the low-income families and the other school takes in all the students from the very wealthy families. Under this new arrangement proposed in the bill, the low-fee school's capacity-to-contribute score would be lower due to the lower incomes of the actual families whose children attend that school. The elite school's capacity-to-contribute score would increase because the families with children at that school can afford to contribute more to the cost of their children's private education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give a specific example of a school that I know well—St Brendan's Catholic Primary School in Moorooka, a school not far from my house that one of my two sons attended. I know St Brendan's church. It was where my parents were married and it's where my mother was buried. So I know that church well and I know the school well—Mrs Cole and all those who do great work there. St Brendan's Moorooka in the southern suburbs of Brisbane only has 70 students, but almost half the students, 46 per cent, are from the most disadvantaged educational background. Forty per cent have a language background other than English and 17 per cent have a medically diagnosed disability. Under the current SES scoring system,  St Brendan's has a score of 102, putting it above the national average, which is not actually a true reflection of the school community. The DMI score  puts St Brendan's at the minimum level of capacity to contribute, which more realistically reflects the situation of the school community, meaning increased funding would flow to St Brendan's. I should say that my children do not go to that school now, so I'm at some length from it. On the face of it, there have been many stories like the story of St Brendan's. The implementation of this change should mean a fairer funding distribution within non-government schools compared to what currently occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the Labor Party have sent this bill to a Senate inquiry to make sure it will work as intended and have a fairer distribution of funding to non-government schools. I do note that there is some capacity for the minister to do something like the old funding-maintain deal under previous quadrenniums of education funding for schools that miss out. Some might call it an education slush fund, but I wouldn't be that unkind. It would be for the minister to make sure that schools that are worse off in that gradual transition can be accommodated. So we might see people writing off to the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former teacher, I absolutely agree that school funding should be guided by need. It should be the basics for every student in Australia and then loadings based on need. That's an appropriate way to approach education. Although this bill is intended to make funding for non-government schools fairer, sadly, it will not do a single thing to make funding for public schools fairer. I want to focus on public schools because, remember, public schools educate two out of three Australian children. Around 2½ million Australian students go to a public school. Some go to both, but 2½ million Australian lives are going to be impacted by government decisions. Public schools educate not just two out of three but 80 per cent of the disadvantaged students, 82 per cent of the poorest kids, 84 per cent of Indigenous Australians and 74 per cent of kids with disabilities. So that's not two in three; it's well and truly above.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, public schools get the least help from this government. Public schools are not the priority of the Morrison government. They haven't been the priority of the Abbott government or the Turnbull government. The Liberals and the Nationals will only fund public schools to 20 per cent of the schooling resource standards, but they fund private schools up to 80 per cent. In fact, this government's plan is for public schools to never, ever reach 100 per cent of the schooling resource standards, the costs associated with educating a student. They will make sure that non-government schools are funded to 100 per cent of the SRS—and some above—but not public schools. Public schools can only ever expect, under this government's watch, to get to 95 per cent, and some of those will be lucky to get there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can Australia's schooling system be so unequal when it has been the foundation for an egalitarian society? This is a fundamental departure, I would suggest. Under their agreements, by 2023 almost all private schools will be funded at or above their fair level of funding, but almost all public schools will remain below it. That's not sector-blind, needs based funding. Remember what Gonski was talking about: sector-blind, needs based funding. That was the philosophy. That was what the economic driver was. That's what Gonski recognised as a banker—remember, he wasn't a teacher; he was a banker—who saw the economic benefits of investing in education. And how do you get best bang for your buck? By having sector-blind, needs based funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is not even trying to reflect some level of equality. Every parent knows that school funding is important. I could go through my private schools and my state schools. All parents are passionate about their children receiving the best possible education. I know that they give up their time to run lamington drives, to have sausage sizzles, to have trivia nights and raffles. They don't do it for the fun of it; they do it to give their children a better chance in life. I know that every dollar counts when it comes to educating our children. This government is happy to spend $3.4 billion to deliver targeted, needs based funding for private schools, but they refuse to provide a single dollar extra for underfunded public schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the next member of the coalition jumps up and says, 'We're spending record amounts in education,' I remind them of the basic mathematics that there is a record number of Australians now. Of course you're spending record amounts of funding in schools; there are more Australians than there have ever been before. The Grattan Institute has argued that teacher wages and increases in student numbers have meant public schools have not had a real increase in funding. We know that this year more students are enrolling in public schools than in any other sector. The growth numbers are in some of those areas such as disability. The increase has been greater than the general population increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean? It has implications for resources—not only teaching resources and physical resources but the physical classrooms and buildings needed to accommodate the extra 150 students over the past five years. An ABC investigation into public schools last August found there was an urgent demand in public schools for basic facilities such as new classrooms, toilet maintenance, leaking roofs, heating and cooling. It is not unreasonable for a parent to expect that their local public school will have adequate classrooms, adequate bathroom facilities, roofs that don't leak, classrooms that are not so uncomfortable that children can't concentrate enough to learn. These are basic requirements for learning. Coming from Queensland, where it does get a bit warm in summer, I particularly appreciate the commitment by the Palaszczuk government to provide air conditioning in schools. That is a great commitment to providing top-class schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every child deserves a good education. Teaching resources are obviously critically important as well. The inequality that is being entrenched in school funding agreements comes at a time when we have seen a long-term decline in students' reading, mathematics and science skills. Australian students have recorded the worst results in reading, maths and science since international testing began. I remind you that we are in the seventh year of this coalition government. Our schoolkids are now around a year behind in these basic subjects. Australia has fallen behind the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland and Estonia. If no action is taken to reverse these falling standards, Australia's performance in maths will be the fifth-. worst in the developed world by 2030. In reading Australia will drop to 23rd and in science Australia will drop to 31st. In short, we will have slumped from one of the best performers in the world to one of the worst. This is alarming, and the Morrison government should be addressing this decline urgently. They are now in their seventh year of government—seven long years of wasted opportunities—and they have done nothing to turn around these plummeting results. If our kids are not learning to read, write and do maths and science this government is failing our kids and failing Australia. It is failing the ageing Australians who will need the jobs of the future that come with those STEM-type subjects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that funding is important to address this decline. When Labor were in government we started to see improvements at the school level, because we demanded that schools spent the extra funding well. I can give you many concrete examples. I will particularly point to Kuraby State School in my electorate. They are a strong culturally and linguistically diverse community, and they are making investments in early education, as so many state schools do, where they turn kids around so quickly and the benefits come later in life. At Eagleby South State School—not in my electorate, but I wanted to mention it, because it is not too far from my electorate of Moreton—they hired and trained extra reading aides and introduced a new reading program. The year 6 and 7 reading age at that school went from 50 per cent up to 70 per cent. They are real changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government seems incapable of addressing the decline in the literacy and numeracy standards of Australian schoolchildren, so I'll give it a few tips. Most of this is really common sense. We need to get back to basics. You need to learn to read before you can read to learn. We need to raise teacher entry standards so we can have the best and brightest people teaching our children. We know that the best-performing schools take teachers from the top 30 per cent of achievers. Teaching should not be a last choice; it should be something that people are proud to do. We need to use evidence, like we do in medicine, so we teach the basics well. And obviously we need to properly and fairly fund all of our schools. We need to have targets and a plan to get there—for instance, a target that Australia is placed in the top five countries internationally in reading, mathematics and science by 2025. Labor had actually agreed to a detailed plan with the states to improve school performance in reading, maths and science in 2013, but the new coalition government under Tony Abbott junked that plan in late 2013, calling it red tape. They are in their seventh year of government now. Children who started primary school back when the Abbott government came in are now in high school. What have they done? They have locked in unfair funding. They think the schools with the greatest need deserve the least amount of funding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's failure to address these alarming declines in educational standards is not only failing our children but has long-term implications for Australia's economy. There is evidence that a one per cent change in literacy is associated with a 2.5 per cent change in labour productivity. The economy under this coalition government is already in strife. Living standards have been eroded by stagnant wages, falling private investment, stalling productivity, record high underemployment and household debt. Economic growth is at its slowest since the global financial crisis, and more headwinds are coming our way. It doesn't bode well for Australia's future when the Liberal government can't get the basics right for our economy and it can't get the basics right for our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has no plan to address any of the challenges that are facing this country—no plan to fix the economy, no plan to address the decline in educational standards and no plan to properly fund all schools. We need a leader, but all we have is fluff and spin and shiny, glossy brochures. I support this bill, but I also support the amendment moved by the member for Sydney, which notes the government has damaged Australia's schooling system.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I rise to support this bill, the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. Centre Alliance was critical in assisting the landing of the major Gonski education reforms in the last parliament, negotiating for Australian schools to receive $23.5 billion—$4.9 billion above the government's original proposal of $18.6 billion. This was critical for South Australia in particular, because, when the previous state government had an agreement with the then Gillard government, the Gonski agreement that was negotiated had the funding in the backend of the agreement. That meant that many South Australian schools were behind their counterparts in other states, because the funding for them was in years 5 and 6, outside of forward estimates, not that I'm being particularly critical there, but I do appreciate that we needed to make sure that we got reforms through. So we negotiated for those underfunded Australian schools to reach their new funding targets within six years rather than within the government's original 10-year proposal. We felt that that was important because a child that was five years of age shouldn't have to wait until it was 15 years of age by the time that reform was completely implemented. It is important to recognise that this has led to record funding levels in education by the federal government, even despite the fact that funding for public schools ultimately remains a responsibility of states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also negotiated for a National School Resourcing Board to be implemented to review and improve the school funding methodology, with benchmarks for state and territory governments so that they pay their fair share of education. In the early days of Gonski, we saw that, where the federal government tipped in, a particular state or territory government would in some cases crab walk away from their responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The central element of this bill comes directly from the school national schools resourcing boards reveals school funding, the June 2018 <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the socio</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">economic status score methodology</span>. A key recommendation of the board was that the socioeconomic status scores for non-government schools should be calculated on the capacity of school families to contribute to the cost of education rather than on area based calculations based on postcode. The reason that this is important is that many families make enormous sacrifices to send their children to a non-government school because they are not as wealthy as the average resident in that particular school's area or postcode. This can often be because families live outside the area where the school is. This is particularly true in my electorate of Mayo, where families often live in outer lying rural areas and townships and send their children to the larger towns, where non-government schools are often based. It is worth remembering that not all non-government schools are wealthy schools from leafy inner suburbs. For example, a good number of students in non-government schools in Mayo are actually children on school cards. Many of them are children with special needs who are supported and included in the very inclusive and caring small environments for children. A long-running South Australian initiative, the school cards support children from financially disadvantaged backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that schools right across my electorate, whether they be independent or state schools, are all raising funds. They're all running sausage sizzles, they're all running cake stalls and they're all organising school fetes. All of that is done to put more money back into their schools. They are careful with their budget, particularly when they're a small school. That's because in many of our small schools in regional areas if one family can no longer afford to stay at that school, an independent school, that can drastically change enrolment numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talk about school cards and about families who send their children to independent schools and sacrifice so much to do so, often the reason they do that is that they want their child to be taught in the faith that's in the home or they're looking for different learning styles that will suit the specific needs of their children, whether it be Montessori or Waldorf-Steiner models. I have Steiner model schools in the Adelaide Hills and in Willunga. I will say, though, that every school in my electorate is a quality school, whether it is a public school or an independent school. For a regional area, we provide significant choice for families, and that, ultimately, is what we want to see in an education system, that there is choice for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have received reassurances from the government that the funding transition is being made so as to minimise any disruption. Given my knowledge of the non-government schools in Mayo, I am confident that these changes will create positive funding outcomes for all of our non-government schools, and I therefore commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to mention the school community fund, which provided $200,000 per electorate for small projects. I think that provided an enormous boost to our schools right across Australia. They were small projects organised through electorate offices. I would strongly encourage the minister to consider having a funding round in the future. I know that it was well oversubscribed in my electorate, and I'd like to think that more schools in my electorate would have the opportunity to participate in that grant round in the future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a>  It's hardly my maiden speech. I'm pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. I indicate that we in the Labor Party are supporting the legislation and that I'm also strongly supporting the amendment moved by the shadow minister for education and training. I remind the House that, under this legislation, the funding of non-government schools is a shared responsibility between parents, guardians and the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. Under existing legislation, non-government schools are transitioning to receive a Commonwealth funding share of 80 per cent of the school resourcing standard by 2027. The funding share is to be discounted by a school's capacity-to-contribute percentage, which calculates the capacity of the school community to contribute to the students' education. Certain non-government schools, including the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schools, are exempt from the CTC reduction and will receive full base funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2001 the CTC had been determined using an area based SES score calculated every five years from census data, with schools assigned a score that is the average of certain SES indicators for the areas in which students reside. This means that the SES score for an area is based on the averaging of the characteristics of all people residing in a certain geographical area, not just the families of the students attending the school. This was the best available data when the measure was implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new DMI model will be based on the median income of parents and guardians at the school. Schools will collect names and residential addresses for all students, which will be provided to the department of education. The department will then provide the data to the Australian tax office, which will match it against income metadata and provide de-identified income data back to the department. A school's DMI will be based on a three-year rolling average to minimise year-on-year fluctuation. The bill also contains transition measures aimed to smooth the change from the current arrangements to direct measure and minimise adverse impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 2020-22 schools will be moved to the new DMI when it is most financially beneficial for them to do so. In 2020 and 2021 schools will be provided with three different options for working out their CTC score. Schools would automatically receive the most beneficial of the three options. The new direct measure will apply to all schools by 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enables adjustments to the rate at which schools move to their 80 per cent Commonwealth SRS share, to smooth out any fluctuations presented by the phased implementation of the DMI methodology. Non-government schools which are transitioning down to an 80 per cent Commonwealth share of SRS will have an extension of two years from 2027 to 2029. All non-government schools will have their starting Commonwealth share reset from 2020 to 2022 to ensure schools are not unnecessarily disadvantaged by moving away from the SES methodology to the new direct measure of income. These transition arrangements are being funded through the $3.4 billion budget allocation. And then there are circumstances where a school can be considered a majority Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school, impacting its funding requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, as I say, is supporting this legislation. We have referred the bill to a Senate inquiry so it receives the scrutiny appropriate for a significant change to legislation such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should take note that whilst there is broad support across the education sector—I'll come to my concern about the failure to fund the public education system. There is broad support amongst private educators for this legislation. However, I need to point out that there is a coalition of regional independent schools across Australia who are very concerned about this legislation. They've put out a press release under the name of Stephen Higgs, the chair of the Coalition for Regional Independent Schools, and they are very concerned. They say they represent 50 schools from states and territories, and they say they'll be stripped of millions of dollars a year under this new model, forcing them to cut programs, increase fees and, in some instances, potentially close their doors. I've encouraged those schools to make representations to the minister. Clearly there are opportunities within the way in which the legislation's been framed for the minister to make exceptions and to deal with the concerns raised by these particular individual schools.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem I've got is that, while we're pumping $3.4 billion into the private education system, we're not putting a similar amount into the public education system.</span>

                    </a>  But my concern about the government member stands. Their lack of support for the public education system is here for all to see. I want to talk to a particular issue in the public education system around the support of Aboriginal kids in remote Aboriginal communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people across the other side, bar the minister sitting at the table, have absolutely no idea what I am talking about, but let's be very clear. I wonder if any of them have read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report which was recently introduced. Did they notice the different rates of school attainment by kids who live in very remote communities like the communities I work in in my electorate? If they did they'd be saying they want this government and the state and territory governments to spend more on public education to make sure the disadvantage which is being suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who live in remote communities is properly addressed. But it is not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids; there are elements of disadvantage in the public education system right across this country, and this government effectively says it just doesn't care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals think it's fine to provide public schools with only 20 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard while they give private schools 80 per cent. Why could that possibly be? I stand here as a proud former teacher who worked in schools in the Northern Territory and who has done research on Aboriginal education in the bush. I understand the nature of the challenges. But what I'm concerned about is the failure of this government to accept its responsibilities to address the disadvantage and the need in the public education system across Australia but most particularly in Aboriginal communities in the area that I look after. I just want to go to some of the figures in this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This demonstrates that kids who live in remote and very remote communities have an on-average attendance of two or three days a week at school. How can anyone achieve a reasonable educational outcome by going to school two or three days a week? Yet we've had the government and the former minister responsible for First Nations people, Nigel Scullion, funding the school attendance program in electorates across Australia. Sadly, little has changed as a result of that investment. The government is currently investing $78.4 million from February 2019 to extend this school attendance program until 30 December 2021. Between 2015 and 2018 the investment was $80 million after an initial trial period, $18.1 million, in 2014. The total spent has been $176.5 million, but to what end? What is the evaluation of this expenditure? How has this money been spent to achieve better outcomes? What we know from this <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report is that school attendance levels have fallen, not improved. Despite that, this government has spent this $176.5 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is merit in spending this money if it's directed to the right areas, if it's in partnership with Aboriginal communities and the public education sector, if it's in the priority areas that money should be spent in. There are teachers around the bush who work their hearts out for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids for little or no reward, and they don't get properly acknowledged. They work in difficult circumstances and they work in partnership with the communities within which they work, but because of the failure of governments to fund them sufficiently they lack the resources to do the job they want to do. They don't have the resources, and we have seen that this is not something that rests just with the Liberal Party. This is a policy conundrum which should have been addressed properly by both sides of this parliament and is yet to be addressed, because we're not prepared to give Aboriginal people the opportunities they deserve to make decisions about their own education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are members in the House who would remember the old ASSPA committees. The Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness programs existed across the country and were partnerships where the government funded committees in every educational unit in every school for partnering with the community around what the school priorities should be and to engage with the community. These no longer exist, so there's no process by which the government relates to and works with the communities to provide a better educational outcome for these children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government dictate. They promulgate by fiat. They spend money like the $170 million-odd—$176.5 million—I referred to. By the way, it has provided employment for Aboriginal people, but it has not got the outcomes that people are after in terms of improving school attendance. As a result, as you might rightly expect, the performance levels for Aboriginal kids in literacy and numeracy across the country are not what we would want, and it gets worse as you move further into the bush. It doesn't matter where you are, in which state or territory, the experience of remote and very remote communities is very different from the experience of Aboriginal kids who might live in major metropolitan centres. Yet there is no difference in approach to funding. When we think about need, these people need this money to be spent. They need it to be allocated. They need it to be properly partnered with state and territory governments, who also have a responsibility. It does require saying to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: 'We have confidence in you and will partner with you in making decisions about the education of your children.' Sadly, that is not the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government is spending $3.4 billion through this piece of legislation to support the private school sector, why isn't it putting an equivalent amount into the public education system? Why isn't it targeting money to those schools where there's massive disadvantage, like the ones I've been referring to, in remote and very remote communities, or indeed in metropolitan centres, where the needs are also great in some cases. There is an issue here about the government not accepting it has a responsibility to support the public education system. I say to the government: this legislation which has been introduced deserves support. I point out there are schools that have expressed their concern, but I ask you to contemplate what you need to do to provide an equivalent resource to the public education system, to support those educators who are working their backsides off, to support communities that need new infrastructure and to support bilingual education, Aboriginal support workers and the like. Why can't you do it? You've got the capacity to do it. You've shown you're prepared to do it for the private education system. Why can't you wake up to yourselves and do it for the public education system?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I thank those members who spoke on the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. The Australian government is committed to providing every child with a quality education regardless of where they live or what school they attend. Government schools continue to receive record levels of Australian government funding, with an estimated $127.8 billion of recurrent funding expected to flow to government schools from 2018 to 2029, providing strong growth in funding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces a new, more accurate methodology to calculate a non-government school's capacity to financially contribute to the costs of schooling. This methodology was the result of recommendations made by the National School Resourcing Board in its <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the socio-economic status score methodology: final report, June 2018</span>. The new methodology uses a more robust and reliable set of data to estimate the capacity of parents and guardians to contribute to the cost of schooling, which will ensure more funding flows to the schools that need it most. To ensure that Australian families will have choice and equity in education, the Australian government will provide additional funding to 2029 of $3.4 billion for the direct measured income and $1.2 billion for the Choice and Affordability Fund. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces changes to non-government schools' rates of transition to the nationally consistent Commonwealth share of the schooling resourcing standard for non-government schools. This change will allow schools time to plan and adjust to the new measure. The bill also includes measures to support financial certainty by allowing schools time to plan as the new arrangements are implemented. To further assist the transition, under the Choice and Affordability Fund the state based Catholic education commissions and associations of independent schools will flexibly administer the fund, including quarantining a percentage of funding that will flow directly to regional and remote schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A robust review process will be established by July 2020 to address unexpected or unique circumstances affecting financial capacity of a school's community. The National School Resourcing Board will examine the schooling resourcing standard loadings as they impact students and schools in regional Australia, and the minister will be taking the terms of reference for this work to the next COAG Education Council. The review will commence by June. Further work will be undertaken in consultation with the ABS and the sector to investigate what additional data could be used to further refine how the capacity to contribute is calculated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, this bill supports the longstanding agreement that funding of non-government schools is a shared responsibility between the families of students attending those schools, the federal government, and the state and territory governments. Subsequently, the new methodology for calculating the capacity of parents and guardians to contribute to non-government schooling will ensure Commonwealth funding is fairer and more targeted. I thank members for their contributions and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

And then, when it's been done back to them, the indignation has been spectacular, the indignation of those opposite, having voted to shut down any voices that are not their own, and then they come here saying: 'Oh, please, can't we have some cooperation? Please, can't we get a bill through today rather than do the third reading tomorrow so we can push it across to a Senate that isn't even on for a number of weeks?' You can't exactly second a bill to an estimates committee. You can't exactly rush it through today and think it's going to make any difference at all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I know it is a little unusual for me to speak on the third reading of a bill, but I do really want to make it clear, because we have delayed until tomorrow the third reading, that Labor does support the Australian Education Amendment (Direct Measure of Income) Bill 2020. We do support a more accurate measure of parental income. It is something that we sought to do coming out of the first Gonski review. There was a desire at that stage to have a more accurate measure of parental income to calculate the capacity to contribute at that time, but of course we didn't have the data available to us in the way that it is now with the project that the government has engaged in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, of course, saw coming out of the National School Resourcing Board the suggestion that we would do this more accurate measure of parental income. It is possible to have two schools that are located in the one community. One of those schools might have very high fees. It might be a very wealthy school in terms of the resources, the buildings and so on. Another non-government school in the same area, drawing from broadly the same community, might be a low-fee school drawing from parents who have a lower capacity to contribute. In that instance you will see that school with the lower fees and lower resources will likely see that its funding from the Commonwealth will increase. We've never objected to this increase for non-government schools; in fact, it was Labor that stood side by side with non-government schools when—</span>

                    </a>  I hear the interjection from those opposite—since you cut $30 billion from school funding in the 2014 budget, having promised in the 2013 election campaign: 'You can vote Liberal. You can vote Labor. Not a dollar difference to your school.' Yes, those opposite all stood up during that 2013 campaign and said: 'Oh, you can vote for us. We won't cut any school funding.' And then with that very first budget, in 2014—we all remember the $30 billion that was cut from school funding—what happened? Those across the road got a little bit nervous. They couldn't get their massive cuts through the Senate, so they did a tricky deal with the Senate and, instead of cutting $30 billion from school funding, they went to a much more generous $22 billion cut to school funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we had more recently? We have had a government that had to get rid of their previous education minister because he had so antagonised non-government schools that they found it impossible to work with him. They have a new education minister now whose job it was just to take this off the front pages. Now we have a scenario where non-government schools will receive several billion dollars of extra funding. Of course it doesn't go the whole way to restoring what's been lost by those schools during this period of delay, but it is a very important thing to restore the funding that we always campaigned for. We always said that Catholic schools and independent schools should be properly funded. It was only those opposite who said that those schools should not be funded appropriately. It was only those opposite who were looking to cut their funding.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the big issue, the big problem with this proposal that we are voting on today is not what it does for non-government schools; it's what it doesn't do for public schools. There are 2½ million children in this country who go to public schools.</span>

                    </a>  I'm just going to savour that for a moment! Those opposite, in their interjections, betray their complete ignorance of the funding agreement that their government has entered into with the states and territories. What those opposite don't understand is that public schools in their electorates will only ever receive 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard and loadings for their school. This is baked into the funding agreements that you have with the states and territories. The public schools in your electorates will never receive more than 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard, of the fair funding level for that school. That's what you have signed up to. Non-government schools will receive 100 per cent or more of their fair funding level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side don't begrudge the non-government schools that they're getting their fair funding level. What breaks my heart is that there are 2½ million children going to schools where they'll only ever get 95 per cent of their fair funding level. How is that fair? Those opposite talk about their support for sector-blind, needs based funding. This is not sector blind. This is sector specific. It's as sector specific as it could possibly be. If you go to a Catholic school you will get your fair school funding, if you go to an independent school you will get your fair school funding, but if you're one of the 2½ million children who go to a public school in this country you won't. It could not be more sector specific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it's public schools that educate the majority of children who have a disability. It's public schools that educate the majority of children that are in a small school or a remote school. It's public schools that educate the majority of First Nations children in this country. It's public schools that educate the majority of children who come from a language background other than English. It's public schools that are looking after the most disadvantaged kids in our country by and large, so this is neither sector-blind nor needs based funding. For those opposite to feign ignorance—are you feigning ignorance of this funding arrangement or have you ignored it? The only way for us to understand the fact that the funding cuts that we campaigned against are being restored for kids in the Catholic and independent sector but are not being restored for kids in the public sector is to believe that those opposite have deliberately made a choice to privilege two sectors over the third sector, the sector which educates the majority of children in this country. If that's what you are agreeing to you should just be upfront about it. You should just be upfront about turning your backs on those 2½ million children.</span>

If the government wants to postpone a bill on multinational tax avoidance it needs to explain to the House why. We have gone through a week, and most of last week, where the only thing we were dealing with was appropriations, where bills like this have been put off into the never-never again and again. We've had speech after speech on the only bill where no-one has to talk about the legislation, and the only question before the House was whether or not money that everyone agrees should be paid would be paid. That's all the appropriations debate was. That's all this parliament has done. All that time, we've been waiting for the next bill in order after the education bill, which is the Treasury laws amendment bill that deals with multinational tax avoidance. After these weeks of waiting to get to the moment when the House would deal with multinational tax avoidance, without giving a single reason, without giving one single reason, the minister stands up and says, 'Let's just move on to something else.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament is in fact meant to follow an agenda. The government is in fact meant to have a program. I've got to say I have never seen a program as light as the one this parliament has these days. We've had time after time where the speeches that we got were only on the Governor-General address-in-reply and on appropriations bills. If it continues this way there will be members of parliament elected at the last election who will never have given a substantive speech on legislation.</span>

                  </a>  They won't have. Look at the list. Every time we deal with a bill with substantive legislation—in this entire year we are yet to have a piece of legislation where we have had a division on the second reading. Everything that has been in front of us has been the ordinary business of government that is thrown up by the departments each year and that both sides of politics agree has to happen, but in terms of a government with a plan or with some sort of agenda there's been nothing. When they want to change even the agenda of the day in parliament they don't even bother to give the minister a speech to say, 'Here's why.' I don't blame the member of the executive at the table; it's not his job to choose all the words. Someone should have given you something you could have read out on why we're delaying dealing with multinational tax avoidance. It's a serious thing to put off. It's a serious decision of the parliament to decide that multinational tax avoidance won't be dealt with today. We had Monday where we dealt all day—all day—with whether or not we would pay bills that everybody agrees have to be paid. We had Tuesday where we dealt—all day—with whether or not we would pay bills that everybody agrees have to be paid. In the first half of today we dealt with whether or not we would pay bills that automatically have to be paid. We spent the debate for the entirety of last week—</span>

                  </a>  You know you've been warned. You know there's probably a vote coming up. Can I encourage you to keep interjecting on me? I'd love it. I shouldn't have told him that, Deputy Speaker Claydon. That one's on me. But, after all of last week, where once again we were not dealing with substantive legislation, where the question before the chair was whether or not appropriations should be paid, the government now gets to, first, an education bill where the only controversial issue on it, in terms of whether the bill will be supported or not, was whether the third reading should take place today or tomorrow. That was the only issue. </span>

No-one from the government can tell us why it's been delayed. Some in the government had aspirations as to what they'd do when they became members of parliament. What happens when they get here? They discover their main job is to vote that the Leader of the Opposition be no further heard. There's an achievement. All those thoughts and policy ideas that came to you from constituents—all those people who would have gone to every one of you saying, 'Can't we do something about multinational tax avoidance?'—you find out now you're going to vote to put it off, and you don't even have a government that will tell you why. </span>

                  </a>  I acknowledge the interjection from the former future Deputy Speaker. I acknowledge his interjection as he leaves the room.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I will say, on what people were told by their constituents and what they told them: count the number of votes you've had on substantive matters. Count the number of votes you've had this term, and count up how many times your contribution to the parliament has been that someone who disagrees with you won't be heard. I think you'll find it's a majority of votes you've been in. That's what's happened. I don't doubt the goodwill of people when they first run for parliament. I don't doubt, with people who we fought in marginals or who took on safe seats for those opposite, that while we have different views there is goodwill and there are good reasons that people want to be here. But then they arrive and discover the only agenda that this government has is to vote to silence members of the opposition and to make sure that the Leader of the Opposition, whenever he stands up on a suspension, gets four words out and no more. That's what the Prime Minister, who normally sits in that chair, hasn't just reduced the parliament to—he's reduced your contribution to that as well. This is real. I don't doubt that you came here for good reasons—different policy views, but good reasons—for what you believed you could achieve. Look at how that man who normally sits there is making you vote, and think about the contribution and the aspirations that you had and what your contribution is being reduced to. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, you get to have a little bit more. You're not just being asked to silence opposition members; you're being asked to put off something substantive. You're being asked to put off a bill about multinational tax reform. To use the Prime Minister's trick, hands up how many of you know why. How many of you know why it's being put off? This is a bill that's gone through your party room. You've had a minister stand up in the party room and tell you why this is a good thing to support, and you've all agreed it should be supported. Every office was delivered the blue today and you were told this is what we'd be debating next. Now, all of a sudden, you're not, and you haven't been told why. The parliament hasn't been told why. </span>

It didn't happen under John Howard like this. It did not happen under Tony Abbott or Malcolm Turnbull. There would be occasions where the closure was moved but the key question used to be whether or not leave would be granted. Now it is whether or not you can get more than four words out. For those of you who have former members of your own party in your own area, ask them whether this is new—because it is and your role and your contribution is being belittled. Whether you stand up for yourselves or you just let the Prime Minister tell you that what you've been elected to is a bubble that doesn't matter is up to you. We're opposing this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  The bill should not be postponed. Parliament should debate the matter which is before the House for the reasons that were set out in minister's second reading speech. I've got to say that, when the minister came into this place and introduced a bill which is going to address the problem of multinational tax avoidance, I did not doubt for a moment that he was genuine. But I did doubt his commitment, because this government has form on avoiding bills that deal with multinational tax avoidance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember their great announcements in the last budget. We were going to address this $13 billion problem of multinational tax avoidance, and I want you to remember that number—$13 billion worth of tax avoidance. That's the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme budget. That's what we're talking about. That's what we're putting off—an amount of money equivalent to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme budget. They told us that they were going to set up a task force: 'We're going to have a task force to drill down into the issue and chase down the $13 billion worth of multinational tax avoidance.' It sounds good. It sounds very good. It sounds like something that every member in this House would, I'm sure, get behind. But a few weeks ago we learnt—like so much that this bloke from the marketing department puts out—that there was no task force. The task force didn't exist. It was all spin and marketing from the champion of spin and marketing. And we see it again today: a bill brought before the House that is going to deal with a $13 billion problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of members in the House at the moment. When I looked across the chamber, I thought, 'This is good. We're going to get a speech from each and every one of them about how committed they are to addressing the scourge of multinational tax avoidance—$13 billion worth every year—and the things that they could put their money towards in their electorates.' I'd have been very interested to hear those speeches. I wondered why all of these members were in the House, and I was certain that they were here to talk about multinational tax avoidance. But, instead of that, they're all lined up to shut down debate. What is it that they're going to put ahead of this in the parliamentary agenda? I'm sure they don't even know the answer to that. They are here to once again gag debate, as they have done time and time again this week.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY SPEAKER:</span>  Actually I should have ruled you out of order last time. The Clerk has brought to my attention that you can't take an intervention at this time. It's not an order of the day. I think that's the right language. I shouldn't have accepted it the first time, so I'm sure as hell not accepting it a second time. I give the call to the member for Whitlam.</span>

                  </a>  I think the member for Mackellar's intervention bespeaks his keenness to speak on the side of the debate for why the bill should be brought forward and debated in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. He has obviously got a lot of interest and knowledge on the bill and on the subject matter of multinational tax avoidance. I would welcome an intervention from the member for Mackellar at the appropriate point in time if this bill were brought on for debate, but, unfortunately, in a short moment I'm quite confident that the member for Mackellar, alongside each and every one of the members opposite, is going to vote to ensure that we don't get the opportunity to do that, to ensure that we don't get the opportunity not only to make a speech in the second reading debate but to examine the bill in detail. He has obviously got a lot of questions and a lot of issues that he wants to ventilate on this bill.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It probably would interest the member for Mackellar to know that company after company has been exposed paying zero tax on their Australian operations, including some impoverished entities and some really struggling multinational corporations, such as Goldman Sachs, Shell and IBM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison-Truss-Joyce—weren't they golden eras!—and now McCormack government, as many as one-third of all large companies paid no income tax at all. In fact, data issued by the Australian tax office in December of last year showed that, out of 2,214 large companies, as many as 710 of them paid no tax whatsoever in the year 2017-18. The member for McKellar asks out of order why we say the number is much closer to $13 billion than the tax office's estimate of $2 billion. It's because of that very number. It's because of that very number—and we're not talking about corner shops here: 710 companies pay no tax whatsoever. That includes 102 firms reporting more than $1 billion in total income. I want you to contrast that to the average single Australian worker, who pays 25 per cent of their income in taxes. Large companies earning over a billion dollars average tax payments of only two per cent of their income. I can't think of a more important thing for us to be debating right now, but these members opposite want to debate anything else. They want to play silly parlour games when speaking to the motion.</span>

                  </a>  The member asked me to speak to the motion. We are arguing that these are the matters that should be debated. We should not be postponing this bill, because it is of vital importance to every member in this place—$13 billion worth of unpaid taxes, over 700 companies paying no tax whatsoever, 102 firms who earn more than a billion dollars in total income and yet pay no tax. Somehow those opposite think that's okay. We on this side of the House don't think it's okay; we think it's a matter of national urgency. Like the minister who introduced this bill into the House, we think we should be debating it today.</span>

                    </a>  I'd rather hear what the member for McKellar has got to say in the body of the debate. Now that we're able to do that, I look forward to listening to what the member for McKellar has got to say in reply.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains two measures relating to the integrity of Australia's tax and superannuation system. I'm delighted we're going to have the opportunity to debate these two very important schedules. I won't hold you in suspense. You would've taken, through my contribution in the procedural debate, that Labor's going to support these schedules. We actually think that they're important. The bill has sensible improvements in our tax legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 deals with the issue of significant global entities. It extends the definition of a 'significant global entity' under tax legislation to include more entities, including members of large business groups headed by proprietary companies, trust partnerships, investment entities and individuals. Being defined as a significant global entity carries with it a range of important requirements and impositions under current tax law, including significant penalties around false or misleading statements, increased reporting requirements and multinational anti-tax-avoidance measures. Expanding the definition will defeat attempts to restructure corporations to avoid multinational tax avoidance laws, which were introduced by Labor when we were in government. It's a sensible measure, as I've already said. But, according to the government, it won't do anything to close the enormous multinational tax gap. This goes to the heart of the second reading amendment that I will be moving. The explanatory memorandum notes that the revenue impact of this measure is estimated at nil. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The multinational tax gap was estimated at more than $2 billion by the Australian tax office when it was last publicly estimated in 2016-17. We questioned that estimate back in 2016-17, and a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then. That's likely to be a very conservative estimate. Other estimates put the estimate at closer to $13 billion. I'm sure members in this place would agree that, whether it's $2 billion or $13 billion, it's tax owed and it's tax that should be paid. That money can be put to better use in this country, improving our infrastructure, our school education system, our university education system, our vocational education system, our hospitals, our health care and the quality and availability of pharmaceuticals in this country. I'm sure all honourable members of this place would agree that that is a much better use of that money. Whether it's $2 billion or $13 billion, as more reliable estimates put it, it is money that should be paid and it's money that should be put to work by this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Company after company have been exposed as paying zero tax on their Australian operations, including, as I mentioned in the previous debate, large companies such as Goldman Sachs, Shell and IBM. Under the previous governments and under this government, one-third of all large companies paid no income tax whatsoever. It's extraordinary and worth repeating—one-third of all large companies paid no income tax whatsoever. Data issued by the Australian tax office in December last year showed that out of 2,214 large companies, as many as 710 of them paid no tax whatsoever in 2017-18. That number includes 102 firms reporting more than $1 billion in total revenue. I want you to contrast that picture to the picture of an average Australian worker. A single Australian worker pays 25 per cent of their income in taxes; however, these large companies earning over a billion dollars have average tax payments of only two per cent of income. I want you to think about that for a moment. One earns a billion dollars; another one is earning an average income of under $80,000 a year. One is paying no income tax, or an average of two per cent of their income; the other is paying 25 per cent of their income. It's not fair, it's iniquitous, and more needs to be done about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We only know about the scope of this tax avoidance because of Labor's tax transparency laws, which, I hasten to point out, coalition members voted against. Is it any wonder they didn't want to bring this debate on today? It is a significant embarrassment for government members. The tax transparency laws, which enable us to identify the extent of tax avoidance, were opposed by this mob opposite. When they get up and speak in this debate about their commitment to doing something about multinational tax avoidance, I want them to remember the ignominy and the shame of the fact that they voted against Labor's tax transparency measures—and they would still rather avoid the spotlight. They release this report through gritted teeth every single year in the doldrum days of December after the press gallery have gone home for their Christmas holidays. The coalition want you to think that they're tough on tax avoidance, but nothing could be further from the truth. That's why they spent $24 million last financial year on an advertising campaign promoting tax integrity and their so-called Tax Avoidance Taskforce. Remember that number: $24 million promoting the Tax Avoidance Taskforce. This task force was announced as a budget measure back in 2016, but it's simply not true, like so much that this government does. They've got a plan for everything, but they follow through on nothing. When you peel back the detail, what you discover is that it is all marketing and deception.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Audit Office has recently revealed, there is no Tax Avoidance Taskforce. It was a blatant untruth. The Treasurer knows it. The Prime Minister knows it. They're trying to hoodwink the Australian taxpayers and their own backbench that they're somehow serious about this issue of tax avoidance. They spent $25 million on an advertising campaign. Doesn't that tell you everything about this Prime Minister? It tells you everything you need to know about this Prime Minister. It's about coffee cups and T-shirts saying 'Black in black'. It's about a $25 million anti-tax-avoidance advertising campaign. But, when it comes to doing something about tax avoidance, they are missing in action, and that's why they wanted to delay this debate: because they were embarrassed. It takes a lot to embarrass this mob over here, but they were embarrassed about the fact that they promoted an anti-tax-avoidance task force that simply did not exist. There was no consistent methodology for assigning tax avoidance resources and no actual Tax Avoidance Taskforce. There was no actual task force unit within the tax office. The Prime Minister has been caught out with a red-hot deception once again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the ATO's methodology for assigning resources was so convoluted that the Auditor-General could not confirm whether resourcing was supplied in line with the budget estimates. So not only was their advertising campaign completely misleading and untrue, but the way that they arranged resources within the tax office themselves was, it appears, designed to be an untruth as well. Funding may have been used to cover up real cuts to baseline staff in affected areas. So not only are they not allocating resources as they said they were going to do in their budget papers, but it appears that they've actually cut resources. They've actually taken staffing resources out of the anti-tax-avoidance area. Is it any wonder that this mob do not want to talk about this issue today? There was money spent on ad campaigns to promote actions that simply aren't happening. This is something that the hollow men would be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This farcical approach of this government to multinational tax avoidance shouldn't surprise anybody. In fact, this is exactly how the Morrison government generally responds to most of its problems. It goes something like this. Step one: ignore the problem; call it a Labor conspiracy. Step two: when the public pressure mounts, finally claim that you're responding to the problem while actually doing nothing at all. Step three: spend taxpayer money on a high-concept ad campaign promoting your nonresponse to the problem. This is their game play on so many issues. They've got a plan—a plan for an advertising campaign that advertises the fact that they're doing absolutely nothing. And I'm sure that those government backbenchers who are lined up to speak after me will be happy to supply that final step of ignoring the problem and then spending taxpayer money on an advertising campaign. Sorry, I said there were three steps. There are actually four: when it all goes pear-shaped, blame Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve better than the absolute sideshow of this full carnival. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister should spend less time on ad campaigns and more time ensuring big companies pay their fair share of tax. A small change to an obscure definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act might be a sensible move. Labor back the measure but we don't back the government, and our money's not on the government's willingness to do anything about this $13 billion problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make some comments about schedule 2, 'superannuation and fund mergers'. Schedule 2 will make superannuation fund mergers simpler in the future. It does this by extending tax relief measures that were first introduced by Labor in 2008 to remove unnecessary impediments that would otherwise apply to fund mergers. I will always be in favour of any measure that helps to ensure better returns for fund members. Smaller and underperforming funds in whatever sector—whether they're in the retail sector or the industry sector—cannot be tolerated. Merging achieves better performance for members when they simply cannot achieve those returns in their current state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The now permanent tax relief measures will allow super funds to transfer revenue and capital losses to a new merged fund and to defer taxation consequences on gains and losses from revenue and capital assets. This sensible Labor reform has proved effective in giving fund trustees certainty when planning merger activity. In fact, just today, two funds in Queensland—together with two funds in Western Australia, I'm advised—have announced their intention to merge. This sensible reform will ensure that their members aren't hit with an unintended tax burden on either capital gains or the ability to distribute capital losses on the merger of those funds. It makes sense. It's in the interests of members. We support it. Every Australian deserves to retire with dignity and independence, and Labor will always fight to make a stronger and fairer superannuation system as a result of this reform. The Productivity Commission recommended making it permanent, and the government has finally agreed. I'd now like to formally move my second reading amendment. I move:</span>

That's a surprise, because we've had other members, like the member for Holt, the member for Fraser and others, who have also excelled themselves in the chamber. In the end the Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 1) Bill 2020—without the amendment—comes down to a simple proposition. It goes to the point of tax integrity, about the idea that we're going to have a tax system where people who have obligations are going to meet them. We're in favour of doing that. We're in favouring of making sure people can do that and making sure that corporations can do that while also making sure that we provide appropriate relief in the circumstances for superannuation funds. </span>

                    </a>  I withdraw. I will continue my reflections on the legislation and raise my general concerns about the integrity of the system and the integrity of the people who espouse it and integrity in the situation where we might have particular people who have a complete disregard for tax integrity. There are of course some people inside and outside this place who have little regard for the expenditure of public money and how it is spent. So I welcome the opportunity, at least because it seems that the member for Whitlam in his address still had not come to terms with the basic reality of the extent of multinational tax avoidance. In fact, he started from the proposition of the member for Mackellar, who got up directly and challenged the fact that he was claiming $13 billion of forgone revenue when in fact it was only $2 billion. That can only happen in a situation where they have little or no interest in the facts of the matter and in the legislation at hand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The basis of our support for this legislation is simple: we want to make sure that super funds can merge appropriately in the best interests of their members. It's a legitimate objective and one that we should support on the basis of integrity, but also to make sure that super funds can act where they see fit through consolidation. It's also about making sure we have global entities meeting and honouring their obligations to the Australian taxpayer. The reality is that when you have a tax system with leakage or opportunities where people can forgo their responsibility, somebody else has to pick up the burden, and it falls on the Australian taxpayer to carry the cost to society. Everybody must share in that responsibility. That is the basis on which I support the legislation but not the show ponying of the opposition in their second reading amendment. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  I rise today to speak in favour of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Whitlam. I very much hope that those opposite vote for that amendment, in line with the stated position that they took to the last election and in line with the stated position of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and many others opposite who have spoken in favour of taking superannuation to 12 per cent, a much-needed reform. But I'm going to make a few observations today in relation to the parts of this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 1) Bill 2020, that relate to multinational corporation taxation, and echo the sentiments of the shadow Assistant Treasurer. In particular, I wish to echo that we don't oppose the content of this bill. But, as with so much that we face in this chamber, while it is a step in the right direction, it is a tiny step, a tiny shuffle, in the right direction. At the same time, it is a wholly inadequate, unambitious and uncreative response to what are very serious problems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance, we are dealing with one of the great challenges to our taxation system, yet what we face in this bill is a change to a definition. We should be debating deep, structural, long-term changes to our tax system that make it more sustainable. When one looks at this issue, one can see dozens of countries around the world simultaneously trying to deal with it. The OECD has a base erosion and profit-shifting framework—a very wide ranging, large-scale set of initiatives—which over a hundred countries have signed up to, the reason being that, on some estimates, in the order of $240 billion off the tax base of OECD countries is currently under threat from profit shifting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow Assistant Treasurer outlined, there are far too many major companies in this country who are paying little or no tax, and people in our community, for good reason, are outraged. They are seeing their own personal income tax rise year on year and their own capacity to pay the bills under pressure, but in the media they are seeing company after company paying little or no tax. I want to spend a couple of minutes running through why this is happening and why there is urgency to this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of this, I believe, comes down to fundamental changes in the global economy. When one goes back to international trade theory in the 19th century—for example, Ricardian tax theory or Heckscher-Ohlin—it was a world where people imagined that we had some economies focusing on advanced goods and some economies focusing on resources and inputs, and most trade was between those kinds of economies. Most trade was between countries that were focused on producing the inputs to production processes and countries that would then import back advanced manufactured goods. The vast majority of trade theory in the initial decades of economics was focused on that kind of thinking, and that was actually useful and did describe large parts of the world economy for a long period of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast-forward to the post World War II era, and one can look at someone like Paul Krugman, who won the Nobel Prize for economics for very deep insights into a changing world. He found that much of the world's trade post World War II was actually shifting from what one might consider north-south trade to trade between OECD countries. There was very highly specialised trade of very similar products between countries. His trade model, which was very different from the economics of the first two centuries of the discipline, looked at hyperspecialisation in the automotive industry, for example, where there was massive trade in cars between Japan, Europe and the United States. Krugman hypothesised that this was driven by consumers' demand for a variety of goods. Another example was the fact that the French specialised, through the company Valeo, in air conditioning for passenger cars, whereas the Germans specialised in air conditioning for buses. Fast-forward yet again and I believe that the world economy is now going through as fundamental a change as that, if not more fundamental, where, instead of just specialisation between advanced economies, what we are moving to now is a world where we are seeing competition not between companies based in advanced economies but between global value chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing now, for example, is that Honda is partnering with parts producers in Vietnam and BMW is partnering with parts producers in India. If one looks at the period 1988 to 1998, and what is often referred to as the I6, which is China, India, Korea, Poland, Indonesia and Thailand, what we see is that the growth in completed goods exports, so motorcycles and cars, grew, but not very much. But the growth in parts and components grew more than tenfold. Those parts and those components were often being exported to advanced economies, like Japan, the United States and Western Europe. The point is that we have moved to a different kind of global economy. We've moved to an economy where we shouldn't think of companies as being based in one country. Companies are now globally entities, and they can shift their profits from any country to any other country. We are in the middle of this transformation. The reason this is so fundamental is that this is one of the key drivers of the erosion of advanced economy tax bases. Another related change that's going on in our economies is technological change which is allowing production to occur in any country through 3D printing, or services to be provided far from where the person is with the expertise. For example, we can see all sorts of services in the health sector provided by people in other countries—Indian experts providing diagnostic services to people in Australia, the United States or Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these technological changes are leading to greater productivity growth but they are also leading to opportunities for these multinational companies, multinational agglomerations, to shift profits. It is happening now and it is growing. This is an example of an issue which the OECD recognises is a first-order issue. In the order of up to $240 billion is under threat in the OECD tax base, and that is growing. And what do we have from the government? A bill that changes a definition. That is really what we are challenging here today. It is a step in the right direction, but this is not what we should be doing after seven years of this government. It's simply not good enough that this government is bringing into this policy area something so wholly inadequate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as the shadow Assistant Treasurer alluded to in the procedural debate earlier, it's not just this bill; it is bill after bill after bill that we end up supporting, but as a step in the right direction that is wholly inadequate. In policy area after policy area the debates that we are engaged in in this place are so wholly inadequate that they're reflecting a government whose agenda is so lacking in ambition, so lacking in content and so lacking in creativity that it is simply not good enough for a country that is facing a whole raft of long-term challenges. This is one of them. This is a first-order issue for the federal government, because our tax base is under threat and we need a whole-of-government comprehensive strategy for dealing with this issue—not a hollow government entity that is spending its money on advertising but a long-term strategy where our tax base can be protected. But, as I said, this bill is also symptomatic of this government's overall agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't oppose this bill, as with other bills that have gone through this place over recent sitting weeks that we haven't opposed, but it's with a degree of regret at the lost opportunity. Time after time, we're seeing bills debated where the content of the bill constitutes only a few minutes of most speakers' speeches and then the rest of their speeches are devoted to the weighty matters that we should be considering in far thicker bills, but unfortunately, because of this government's inactivity, we're not. As I said earlier, it's all the more inadequate given the fact that this is a third-term government. It's not like they haven't had time. They've had seven years now to develop a full agenda on this issue. Where is it? On issue after issue, seven long, seven inert, seven wasted years are reflected in the bills that come here and that are wholly inadequate. So, yes, we'll support this bill—it's a step in the right direction—but this is a massive issue that deserves so much more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on the second reading amendment, as the shadow Assistant Treasurer alluded to, the issue of moving to 12 per cent is in and of itself a first-order issue. It is critical that this parliament gets behind the increase to 12 per cent. In a society where people are living longer and longer and in a society where people are under increasing financial stresses, it is absolutely imperative that we put in place a regulatory environment where people's living standards in retirement are protected. As a number of commentators have suggested, we are probably now entering a period where interest rates are going to be at historic lows for a very long time. We are seeing central banks around the world foreshadowing historic low interest rates for years, and, of course, this is going to have an impact on returns right up and down the risk schedule. So we can't make assumptions about equity returns. We can't make assumptions about the returns of asset classes that perhaps we could have a decade or two ago. That's why it's critical that this government puts in place a long-term strategy that protects people's retirement income, given that many people who are investing now might face, in retirements that are longer than ever, very low returns in the lead-up to their retirement and during their retirement. So it is absolutely critical that, in that environment, we increase the rate of saving from 9½ to 12 per cent. This should have been done long ago, but now it is absolutely imperative. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that we not only pass this bill but pass the second reading amendment so that we provide a signal to the sector that the promises that all the major parties took to the last election are going to be fulfilled. In conclusion, this is yet another bill that will get through this place, but it's yet another bill that reflects a missed opportunity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I'm pleased to make a few brief remarks on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 1) Bill 2020, particularly in support of the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the member for Whitlam. The amendment really goes to the heart of a really important debate. It's important on two levels. It's obviously important in terms of its economic impact, in terms of supporting our superannuation system and in terms of supporting the retirement incomes of Australian workers. But, as the member for Whitlam made clear in his contribution, it also goes fundamentally to the question of trust—the question of trust which has been eroded in this place. The second reading amendment gives members opposite an opportunity to vote in this place in accordance with the promises they made to the Australian people at the last election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that this bill has been brought on for debate, and I hope it was brought on following the debate that we had in this place over the proposal that this debate be postponed. Of course the debate should not have been postponed. Of course we should have brought it on. We have seen in this chamber this week a very, very thin legislative agenda, even by the standards of this government. This is a government without a plan and fundamentally a government without a program. The parliament is sitting four out of five weeks at the moment, yet the legislative agenda barely would suffice for one sitting week. This is a government with no plan for the Australian economy, which is evidenced by how slowly this has moved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it was so concerning that it was proposed that this bill, this modest but not insignificant reform, not be proceeded with. It was really concerning to members on this side. We heard a very effective contribution from the Manager of Opposition Business, who put very clearly before the House that we should have this debate now. I'm pleased that the minister formerly at the table was persuaded by that contribution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 13 billion reasons why we should have this debate now. All of us in this place know that we have to take our obligations to secure revenue to fund the business of government very seriously. I'm very pleased that the shadow Assistant Treasurer is here, because he has been leading this debate in this place. For seven years this government has been asleep at the wheel. When the former government was in power, the former member for Lindsay, the former Assistant Treasurer, led the way and continues to lead the way internationally on these critical questions, making sure that we take seriously those companies that are not contributing to Australia and that are abusing their social licence to operate without contributing to our Commonwealth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there are significant revenue pressures. We on this side of the House know that there are things that government could and should be doing. These require revenue and they also require us to look very seriously at those who are not paying the tax that they should be paying. If the minister thinks that's not the case, he will have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. Again, there are 13 billion reasons why we should be proceeding with this legislation now—$13 billion that should come into our revenue, that should be put to good use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally this is a moral question, at two levels. In terms of the bill itself, it is moving one step further towards cracking down on tax avoidance. That's a good thing. It's a good moral thing as well as a good economic thing. But also, in terms of the second reading amendment, this gives government members an opportunity to be true to the commitments they made to their electorates at the last election. I urge every government member to support the second reading amendment and progress the legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I am of course supporting the very sensible second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Whitlam which criticises this government's approach to multinational tax transparency. It also calls on the government to commit to the staged increase in superannuation that is vitally important, particularly for low-paid workers in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 1) Bill 2020, we're supporting the substance of the bill, and schedule 1 relates to significant global entities and expands the definition of a 'significant global entity' in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This will expand reporting requirements to ensure that certain entities currently not captured by the definition are covered by certain reporting requirements and other multinational tax avoidance laws, but it also modifies the rules around country-by-country reporting to ensure Australia complies with Australia's international commitments as part of the OECD's base erosion and profit-shifting action plan. There's been a lot of international attention recently about the BEPS program and ensuring that we're doing all we can to provide as much data as possible to crack down on tax avoidance through international channels. The OECD has set up a process that Australia has signed up to that requires us to meet certain commitments in terms of legislative frameworks to ensure that we participate in those international strategies. This bill achieves that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor support the measures extending the definition of global entities and moving to meet our international commitments, but we believe that this measure simply doesn't go far enough. The government is still letting a large number of multinational corporations get away with paying too little tax and get away with not disclosing that to the Australian people. Data that's been issued by the Australian tax office shows that 710 out of the 2,214 companies examined failed to pay any tax in the 2017-18 tax year. The companies that paid no tax included 102 companies that were reporting more than a billion dollars in total income. For most Australians, it is inconceivable that a company can have a billion dollars in income in a particular year yet pay no tax to support social security and other programs throughout this country, particularly when they're deriving that profit and that income from their operations in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we understand that there are certain rules related to deductions and the ability to use those deductions—particularly capital outlays for major projects. But it's quite evident when you look at the tax transparency data and when you look at the information that's supplied by some of these companies about their operations in Australia that there's more to it than that. A lot of them are using tax havens in other countries, offering loans to subsidiaries and moving income into other jurisdictions to avoid paying corporate tax here in Australia, and that's simply not good enough. It's certainly not being a good corporate citizen. It doesn't meet the expectations of the Australian people. In many respects they are letting down their own Australian employees, who rely on taxation revenue to fund important social services: the roads that they drive on to get to work in the morning, the parks that their kids enjoy playing sports in on weekends and other important infrastructure that's funded through our taxation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the average Australian worker pays 25 per cent of their income in tax, large corporate entities and companies earning over a billion dollars average tax payments of only two per cent of total income. Clearly, there is an imbalance there in the way the taxation system is working. The only reason we know a lot about this and that one-third of large companies fail to pay any tax is the rules and the laws that Labor put in place when we were in government. These were laws that passed the parliament in 2013 about tax transparency and requiring those larger Australian corporations to report on an annual basis the amount of tax that they're actually paying. I think it's worth noting that those opposite opposed that legislation. They opposed that legislation around tax transparency in allowing the Australian public to know exactly what's going on when it comes to the amount of tax that's being paid by large corporate entities in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse still, not only did they oppose it when they were in opposition but, once the legislation was brought in by the Labor Party in government, they then sought to undermine it and water it down. They were successful in doing that because guess what? They teamed up with the Greens. They're often criticising the Greens, but when it comes to political expediency they'll jump into bed with the Greens at a drop of a hat, just to make sure that they get what they want. That's what they did here. They jumped into bed with the Greens to water down tax transparency laws in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame on those opposite! All it's meant is that the Australian people—Australia's hardworking taxpayers—don't know what's going on in a large number of corporations because those large corporations aren't required to report their revenue and their taxation obligations under that act. This is after they voted against Labor's 2012 tax laws, which were directly responsible for BHP being forced to pay a $529 million tax bill in 2018. Now think about all of the services that $529 million funds for Australians—yet those opposite voted against some of those laws that required those large corporations to pay those bills. The coalition is failing small businesses and Australian workers who are struggling to compete while international companies get away with paying very little or no tax at all. We need a government that gets serious about multinational tax and giving concessions to multinationals and that is focused on ensuring that money made in Australia isn't siphoned off overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of this bill that I'd like to comment on is schedule 2, permanent tax relief for merging superannuation funds. That amends various acts to make permanent certain forms of tax relief for merging superannuation funds that are currently temporary. The temporary tax relief measures were originally introduced by Labor in 2008 to help with superannuation and its efficiency, and making these concessions permanent was a recommendation of the Productivity Commission in their 2019 report into superannuation. This measure will make mergers between superannuation funds simpler. Labor supports extending tax relief for merging superannuation funds. Expanding will give fund trustees certainty when planning merger activity and will provide wider benefits to fund members and the superannuation system through increased funds scale and efficiencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also calling on the government to give members and trustees certainty about their retirement incomes into the future by meeting their commitment and by meeting the legislation to increase the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent. Labor has a very proud track record of boosting the compulsory retirement savings of workers in this country, particularly low-income workers who would retire without adequate retirement incomes to fund their retirement if it weren't for the reforms that were introduced by Labor and Labor's commitment to increasing that compulsory rate of superannuation to ensure that retirement incomes keep pace with the cost of living and the cost of increasing incomes in the rest of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that there is a rabble and a group within the coalition that have sought, at every occasion, to undermine that compulsory increase in superannuation savings. It will result in workers retiring with less in their superannuation balances, particularly low-paid workers and those who take breaks from the workforce, which unfortunately are typically women in Australia. What they try to do is undermine the retirement incomes of low-paid workers and women in this country, and for us on this side that's not on. That's not on because it means that, ultimately, those people retire with inadequate balances in their superannuation funds and they have to rely on the age pension to get by into the future to a greater degree than they otherwise would have. That puts an impost on the Australian budget moving into the future and, of course, means that it's harder for us to fund the necessary social services and other programs—particularly things like infrastructure programs—to grow our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fighting continues within the government between members and senators who like to attack the superannuation system and its key pillars, particularly a pillar like this. But this is more than a few rogue backbenchers; it's a reflection of the Liberal Party's ideology, in that they've always been opposed to the notion of universal superannuation. The retirement income review should not be used as a stalking horse for further delays of the legislated increase to 12 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many Australians retire without adequate income savings, which is why our super system needs to be strengthened and protected, not undermined by the coalition. Labor are committed to the legislated superannuation guarantee rise, and we call on the government to do the same, to provide that certainty for Australian workers—particularly at this time of anxiety and uncertainty about the government's track record on economic management, particularly in the context of a slowing economy—by providing a guarantee for that legislated increase and compulsory increases into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original timetable has already been delayed—it's been delayed twice—costing workers who are retiring today between $60,000 and $100,000 in their superannuation balance. Freezing the legislated increase won't lead to pay rises, as those opposite have sought to argue. Our world-class super system means that we have a $3 trillion pool of savings. This not only creates a retirement nest egg for Australians but also means investment in infrastructure and businesses, generating wealth, creating jobs and ensuring Australians own more of their economic activity in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we support these measures but, in our view, they don't go far enough, particularly the measures related to tax transparency and laws in respect of that. Again, we call on the government to make sure that they meet their commitments to Australians when it comes to increasing compulsory retirement savings through the legislated increase in the superannuation guarantee.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2020 Measures No. 1) Bill 2020. The problem of multinational profit-shifting is a massive one. Globally it has been estimated that some $600 billion of profits are shifted to tax havens. That is around two-fifths of all multinational profits being shifted to tax havens. Tax havens affect Australia's tax base. They siphon taxable profits away from jurisdictions like Australia, and the effect is that Australians either have to pay higher personal income taxes or else suffer from a lower quality of services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax havens aren't always illegal but they're frequently immoral, and the users of tax havens include an awful lot of crooks. Tax havens are used by the North Korean regime for money laundering. They're used by extortionists. They're used by drug runners. Mexican drug cartels have been known to stash money in tax havens. So, if you're operating out of a tax haven, you're likely rubbing shoulders with some pretty unsavoury characters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aggressive tax planning erodes public confidence in the tax system. When taxpayers see others minimising their tax through the aggressive use of tax havens, they're less likely to do the right thing. One of the reasons that we have relatively good tax compliance in Australia is a notion that people are playing by the rules. As that starts to break down, the tax base is at threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, has estimated that around four-fifths of the money in offshore bank accounts is there in breach of other countries' tax laws. Counterfeiters, those using forced labour, and al-Qaeda financiers have even routed their payments through tax havens. It has been estimated that there are even environmental vandals in tax havens. Following the Panama Papers, a study in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ature </span><span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">cology &amp; </span><span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">volution</span> found that 70 per cent of fishing vessels implicated in illegal, unreported and unregulated catches had at some point been registered in a jurisdiction like Panama or Belize.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax havens increase inequality. Offshore wealth held in tax havens by Australians has been estimated at six per cent of GDP, according to Gabriel Zucman's work from 2013. Update that to the present day and it would mean that over $100 billion of Australians' assets are currently sitting in tax havens. This is money not just of the wealthy but of the superwealthy. One study which matched data from high-profile leaks to tax statistics estimated that half the money in tax havens was held by the top 1/10,000th of the population. We're not talking about the one per cent. We're not talking about the 0.1 per cent. We are talking about the top 0.01 per cent holding half the wealth in tax havens. That makes sense when you know about the sorts of vehicles we're considering. If you need a minimum million dollar investment, you'll need to be a multimillionaire to be investing in these sorts of vehicles. When you take offshore wealth into account, estimates of inequality turn out to be a whole lot higher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The residents of tax havens themselves don't necessarily benefit from these arrangements, so, if you take a country like Bermuda or the British Virgin Islands, many of the citizens live in poverty. Akin to the 'resource curse', people have talked about the 'finance curse', where places like Bermuda fail to see the benefits for their citizens from being a tax haven. The International Monetary Fund has found that these sorts of negative spillovers can particularly hurt developing countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd commend to the House an important initiative that the OECD has been pursuing, Tax Inspectors Without Borders, modelled on the much better known Doctors Without Borders—Medecins Sans Frontieres. Tax Inspectors Without Borders is a joint initiative of the OECD and the UN Development Program. Working in countries such as Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, it sees tax inspectors work alongside finance ministries in those countries to get the tax that's appropriately due to residents of that country. It's been estimated that for every dollar spent on Tax Inspectors Without Borders there's an additional $100 in revenue to those developing countries. That is an extraordinary payback. I'd encourage the government, through its foreign aid program—limited as it now is—to consider investing more Australian resources in Tax Inspectors Without Borders. It would be an appropriate thing for the government to do in order to deal with some of these challenges that tax havens pose to those in developing countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax havens should be a top priority for this government. Since 2013 there's been a joint initiative of the OECD and the G20 called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. Australia used to be on the steering committee for that. We no longer are. We have shifted from the front seat into the back seat. That's a pity, because it means that we're unable to influence this important conversation and to be leaders on multinational tax avoidance, as occurred during Labor's last term in office. We were at the vanguard of pushing some of these important measures, but, since the coalition's come to office, Australia has been a laggard on dealing with multinational tax avoidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition promised to put in place a register of beneficial ownership and then backflipped, killed the idea. They voted against Labor's measures to close multinational tax loopholes when they were in office, and then, despite us supporting their multinational anti-avoidance law, set about lying to the Australian people: suggesting that Labor had not supported that law. It's simply not true. Labor have supported the modest multinational tax avoidance measures the coalition's put in place, but we would like to see them go further. An estimate from Gabriel Zucman and co-authors is up to $16 billion of additional revenue could be flowing to tax havens as a result of the failure to properly crackdown on tax havens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other countries are looking at alternatives such as digital taxation. Other countries are moving more quickly on the public reporting of country-by-country reports. Other countries have better registers of beneficial ownership, providing accurate information as to who really owns Australians' firms. Other countries have whistleblower protection laws, qui tam laws, which have been in place in Britain and the United States for many years. They have better rules around government tenders, ensuring those who are tendering for government contracts disclose their country of tax domicile. Other countries have significantly greater tax transparency than Australia does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Kingsford Smith pointed out earlier, Labor's laws that would have seen reporting of taxable income and tax paid by firms over $100 million were wound back by the coalition in office via a dodgy deal with the Australian Greens. When the threshold went from $100 million to $200 million two-thirds of private firms were taken out of the tax transparency net. We were told before those laws came into place that they would create a kidnap risk. A variety of questionable excuses were used. I have seen no evidence since those laws came into effect that any of those scare campaigns were anything other than vested interests trying to look after their mates. So it would be perfectly appropriate in an era in which Australians are hankering after more tax transparency for this information to be expanded and for the threshold to be brought down from $200 million to $100 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This tax transparency information has taught Australians the true extent of tax paid in Australia. We can see a significant number of Australian firms, as the member for Whitlam has noted, not paying any tax, including some of Australia's largest firms. The Luxembourg leaks, the Panama papers and the banking royal commission should have taught us that tax transparency is of the utmost importance and that, if you're going to have faith in the system, you need a significant expansion of tax transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has misstated to the Australian people its own record on tax transparency. The moment of greatest chutzpah came when the Prime Minister tried to claim credit for a $300 million tax judgement against Chevron, despite the fact that that judgement was only allowed because of Labor's laws, which he had voted against. He and his colleagues voted against closing a multinational tax avoidance loophole, which was then used to add $300 million to the budget bottom line, and he patted himself on the back for it. What he really should have done was go to the Australian people and say: 'I'm sorry. I got it wrong.' Frankly, the Prime Minister should be saying he's sorry a whole lot more often, on everything from sports rorts to the fact that people can't buy those back-in-black coffee mugs from the Liberal Party website any longer. But the Prime Minister is not really one for apologies, and he wasn't one for apologising for having wrongly voted against Labor's measures to close multinational tax avoidance loopholes.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the coalition we've seen advertisements in which they pat themselves on the back for getting tough on multinational tax avoidance, while at the same time slashing compliance staff in the tax office. The tax office has lost some 4,000 staff since the coalition came to office in 2013. It has lost a huge number of its staff, and the coalition are then calling on the tax office, like they're calling on so many Public Service agencies, to do more with less. We know that, when you cut tax office staff, you cut into the revenue base, because the projection for additional tax office staff is that they more than pay for themselves in ensuring that multinational companies do the right thing. We have a coalition government, which is much more a mateocracy than a meritocracy, that is looking after multinational tax avoidance loopholes.</span>

It is simply a lie put about by the Liberal Party to try to distract from the fact that they, indeed, did vote against Labor's loophole closing. They wrongly claimed that our loophole closing was retrospective. We said that their laws were inadequate, but we would vote for them all the same because modest measures were better than nothing. </span>

So when they're with their well-connected insiders they're always happy to fight for loopholes. When they're advertising to the Australian people they pretend they're serious about tax havens. They simply are not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I want to speak about two fabulous caring organisations on the Bellarine Peninsula, in my seat of Corangamite. Both are great examples of the power of solidarity, when committed individuals contribute their time, skills and resources to the benefit of their community. There has been a lot of talk about grants in this House in recent weeks, and, shamefully, the selection processes around some of these grants—sports, water safety and congestion—have been woeful and unfair. However, some grants, like the Community Support Program and the Volunteer Grants Activity program, give local members of parliament a chance to recognise the enormous good that many organisations do. The two organisations I refer to are recent recipients of a grant, and deservedly so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first organisation is Compassionate Hearts on the Bellarine. Compassionate Hearts has been operating since April last year and provides support to people who have a life-limiting illness and their carers, supplementing their usual palliative care or other services. It provides practical support such as visits, meals, reading or a helping hand to get to services. In addition, it provides community education around grief, illness, dying and loss. The ethos of Compassionate Hearts is about better living and a good death. It was the idea of its chair, Pauline Nunan; palliative care physician Dr David Brumley; and Dr Kate Jackson. It has a committee of nine plus 12 trained volunteers, including volunteers coordinator Ann Mathison. Compassionate Hearts currently cares for about nine patients and takes referrals from Bellarine Health. I was pleased to be able to provide this amazing service with $2,500 from my electorate allowance last year and have recommended Compassionate Hearts for a volunteer grant this year. I urge anyone interested in doing this important work to get in touch with Compassionate Hearts through their website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second organisation is Feed Me Bellarine, an exciting community-driven food-sharing program based in Ocean Grove that is feeding vulnerable families across the Bellarine. While unemployment across Corangamite is relatively low, at three per cent, there are large pockets of underemployment, and I was shocked to find some very low household incomes in some areas of the Bellarine through a map provided to me by the Parliamentary Library last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Feed Me Bellarine has been operating for around two years and is the brainchild of Lana Purcell, owner of Belly Bowls and Bellarine Catering, and chef Anthony Woodbury. The pair are working on saving food waste from two commercial food stores and other commercial cafes, restaurants and food producers and sharing it with the community members who need it the most. They now have a team of over 80 dedicated volunteers. They have had some support from the Freemasons and other organisations, who kindly donated money to buy a food rescue truck to service the area. I know when I visited Lonsdale Hydroponics last year and mentioned Feed Me Bellarine they got involved, and have been supplying seconds tomatoes of a very high quality as part of the program. I thank them and many other food producers for playing their part. Many new links and referrals are happening as the service grows. Currently the program provides about 250 meals a day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people in our community are concerned about waste. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bellarine Times</span> last year reported:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"I've been catering for about five years now and because we do bulk catering, we had a lot of food left over," Lana said.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">"So what we were doing internally was packaging up and giving it to staff and anyone we knew who was struggling at the time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">"But when Anthony came on board, he pushed for us to feed more people."</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Lana and Anthony, who have both experienced some hard times throughout their lives, stress that Feed Me Bellarine is not church-based or funded, and have created the concept "no questions and no agendas".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"We have no connection with anything and just want to help… everyone needs a hand up now and then …"</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge any restaurant or food producer in the Bellarine or Surf Coast to contact Lana through the Feed Me Bellarine website if they can help. I certainly will be doing all I can to help this fantastic social enterprise to grow, including recommending them for a volunteer grant in the recent round.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These fantastic organisations are just two of the reasons that make living on the Bellarine so special. There are many more organisations like them, and I thank each and every one of them for the contribution they make. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="203092" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  This evening I rise to reflect on what I believe is one of the most important statutory bodies established by the Commonwealth government and the Australian parliament. I refer to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. I say that it is one of the most important because this trust, established almost 20 years ago in legislative form in 2001, has the incredible responsibility of preserving, protecting and ensuring public accessibility in the hands of Australians in perpetuity to some of the most important local national and international sites in Australia. I refer to those sites that it manages around Sydney Harbour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make these reflections tonight because the government has established a review after 20 years of the functioning of the trust. It is important, as a local member for an electorate that includes two of the trust sites, that I set out some of my own views. Firstly, I want to say I think that the trust, as it is currently formed, has done an outstanding job in managing the sites that it has responsibility for. From its first chair, Kevin McCann, through to the current chair, Joseph Carrozzi, with the incredible staff that it's had, particularly its inaugural executive director, Jeff Bailey, and his team including Nick Hollo, it has made sure that these jewels on Sydney Harbour have been protected in the way that was intended by the Howard government at the time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to reflect briefly on its history because this trust, this legislation, came about through community action. It came about because of concerned citizens who wanted to see Sydney Harbour's foreshores protected as they should be. It came about because of actions of dedicated local residents, people like Kevin McCann; Linda Bergin; Peter Lowry; Barry O'Keefe, who fought Kim Beazley's proposals to sell off part of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Penguin</span> for housing; and the late Don Goodsir, who was such a driving force. They came together and, with the support of then Prime Minister John Howard, in what I regard to be one of his most significant legacies for the city of Sydney, determined that these former Defence lands should be protected in perpetuity in the ownership of Australians and established a trust to achieve those goals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trust was established in 1998, and I remember it well personally because at the time I was a—very much younger—advisor to the environment minister and had a hand in the drafting of our election policies and the legislation that followed. At the time, when he announced the trust on 5 September 1998, John Howard said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am particularly proud of this announcement as a person who has lived … all of his life in Sydney. Like any other Australian, I am immensely proud of the beauty of the city of Sydney. I am immensely proud of the foreshores of Sydney Harbour … It is an asset that belongs to all of the Australian people … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trust has been vested with a number of sites over the years, including Sub Base Platypus and the Woolwich Docks in my own electorate. It has been a model for the management of these sites, under the visionary leadership of those who have led it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, we have had calls for a review, which have been acted upon by the environment minister. The review is currently being undertaken by the former secretary of planning for New South Wales Carolyn McNally together with former executive director of Infrastructure New South Wales Erin Flaherty. I wanted to say a few things about the direction of that review. Firstly, I want to say that I hope that that review finds that the concept of this trust—that these lands should remain in the ownership of the Australian people for all time under the care of the Commonwealth government—should remain its driving principle, and that the trust must remain the manager and the controller of these sites. Secondly, I want to say that the trust currently has a sunset clause of 2033. My strong view is that that sunset clause should be lifted. These sites should remain in the hands of the Commonwealth and not be transferred to either state or local government agencies. Thirdly, I want to say that the management of these sites must remain in the hands of the trust. While some of these sites are leased to other users to make sure that their old buildings are adapted appropriately, management control on behalf of the Australian people must remain with the trust. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I also want to emphasise that, whatever emerges from this review, it is absolutely essential that the trust continue to ensure that not only the natural environment but the built heritage of these sites is protected. I know there is some concern that some of these sites could be redeveloped. I think that is misplaced, because the heritage of these sites is just so valuable. These are precious assets which we are custodians of on behalf of the Australian people, and long may that continue. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Last week, like many people in this place, I got a chance to get out and about in my electorate and to visit many of the wonderful community groups doing great things in local communities. In particular I was pleased to be able to visit some of the organisations that have received funding under some recent grant rounds. One of those was the Clarendon Vale Neighbourhood Centre, which received a grant for $7,800 to assist the centre in purchasing solar panels for its roof. It was particularly pleasing to see and hear the impact that these solar panels will have on the centre's resources. In particular, the savings that they make on their energy bills will allow them to provide more support to their local community. The Clarendon Vale Neighbourhood Centre is essentially social development in action. It's a wonderful place to go and visit. There are always lots of community members there. They have a dinner there regularly—I think it's on a Thursday—and over 80 people have been turning up from the local community to go to this neighbourhood house for these wonderful meals. Local community members come and volunteer in this centre all the time. So it was wonderful to see them receiving this grant funding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one was one of my councils, the Kingborough Council, who received $20,000 through the Communities Environment Program. That was essentially to work on a major restoration project around the salt marshes on Browns River. This is an area that you wouldn't know was there unless you're a regular local walking around the river as it meets the beach. It's fabulous to see what the vision for this area is. It is eventually for council to put boardwalks in and to connect it up to some of the other features in the Kingston area that council has been working on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also privileged to visit the Dover District School, which received some money through the schools funding program. They got $20,000. The principal there, Mr Eastland—known as Mr E to the students—gave me a tour of the school and showed me the science lab where this money is supposed to be spent. It is desperate for an upgrade. Here we have students in a district school over an hour south of Hobart without a lot of resources, who really need this in their local school. It was wonderful to be able to talk to the principal and some of the students and teachers about the needs of that local school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things that I really enjoyed was being with Senator Catryna Bilyk and our upper house candidate for the seat of Huon, Bastian Seidel. People might remember Bastian's name. He used to be head of the GP college. He is standing for Labor in a local upper house election to be held on 2 May. One of the fun things we did was go to one of the local Catholic schools in the Huon electorate with Catryna Bilyk and Bastian to see them receive a grant for $11,000, to see the plans for the cricket nets and to talk particularly to the young girls at the school who are taking up cricket. I said to them that this year for the first time, when I've been doing school assemblies, I have seen young women in grade 6 aspire to be full-time cricketers. After 12 years in this place that is the first time that I have seen young girls actually aspire to be full-time cricketers in Australia and play for Australia. I was so proud to be able to fund these cricket nets, which I know these young women are going to be able to enjoy in my local community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard a lot in this place, there is a huge demand for facilities for females as females take up what are traditional male sports—AFL, rugby and a whole range of things. But of course we've seen that many community organisations haven't been able to access their fair share of those because of some of the rorting that went on under the current government in the last grants rounds. But I was very pleased to be able to tell my community that they have my support and Labor's support to be able to invest in local facilities in their local communities. I was particularly pleased to be able to talk to these girls about their aspirations and for these cricket nets to be opened, not just for the school but for the whole local community. So it was wonderful to be able to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I have a few minutes I do want to thank the local community members who have been part of this grants round process. They've put a lot of time and energy into shortlisting the grants rounds, going through all the applications and making recommendations for funding. I particularly want to thank Anne Harrison, Michael Higgins, Charles Rich and Peter Shelley for their assistance in the Stronger Communities Program and the Communities Environment Program. I want to thank Perpetua Turner, Juliana Shea and Nigel Jones for the schools program.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Following Clean Up Australia Day on Sunday and our first National Plastics Summit, held in Canberra this week, I'd like to reflect on some of the great work being done both nationally and in my electorate of Robertson to encourage recycling and help close the loop on plastics. I'm proud to be part of a government which is driving Australia's waste recycling industry forward by investing almost $20 million in a series of initiatives that will create new jobs, grow our economy and help our environment. The global recycled plastics market is expected to grow at 7.9 per cent annually over the next decade and be worth almost $67 billion in 2025. The capacity for job creation is significant with investment in the recycling industry. For every 10,000 tonnes of waste sent to landfill, around three direct jobs are created. But, if we recycle the same waste, we can create approximately nine jobs directly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so pleased that recycling and our use of plastics are topics of strong national focus, with Monday's inaugural National Plastics Summit a very clear example. It was really encouraging to hear that more than 200 representatives from industry, government, schools and community came together to discuss ways to reduce plastic waste and increase recycling. One of the key industry pledges made during the summit on Monday was Pact Group's $500 million investment in sustainable packaging re-use and recycling initiatives. SULO, a subsidiary of Pact Group, has a manufacturing plant located in Somersby in my electorate of Robertson. This plant is best known for manufacturing plastic wheelie bins which are used in homes across the country to help support recycling. SULO is already using 40 per cent recycled material to manufacture these wheelie bins, and it was fantastic to hear on Monday that Pact Group have set a goal to increase this to 80 per cent by 2025. I commend Pact Group for playing their part in closing the loop on plastics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local primary school students from the Central Coast are also doing their bit, joining Central Coast Council's pilot program with Plastic Police to help build roads out of soft plastics. Streets outside St Patrick's Catholic Primary School in East Gosford and Budgewoi Public School were recently renewed using the road resurfacing product Reconophalt, with students contributing plastic waste from lunch boxes and classrooms. A total of four Central Coast roads have been upgraded with the road base. Melbourne Street in East Gosford alone utilised more than 300,000 plastics bags, 56,000 glass bottles and toner from almost 7,000 used printer cartridges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Living in a community with many beaches, I'm too often reminded of the devastating effect plastic has on our oceans and sea life. Sadly, every year eight million tonnes of plastic ends up in our oceans. Thankfully, the Central Coast has a number of local organisations working hard to reduce the amount of plastic ending up in our waterways and harming our marine life. For example, the Central Coast not-for-profit Clean4Shore has spent the last decade collecting hundreds of tonnes of plastic from waterways and wetlands. Graeme—or Jono, as he's well known by—Johnston's award-winning program partners with schools, youth and social service organisations and businesses to clean up marine debris. Clean4Shore conducts approximately 110 field trips a year in a number of waterways right across the Central Coast, and on Clean Up Australia Day Jono ran a field trip with the Gosford Girl Guides and Brisbane Water, where they managed to collect 20 bags of waste, mainly soft plastic and food wrappings. The total waste dropped to the tip after the field trip was a massive 180 kilograms. The federal government has been able to help continue funding the important work of Clean4Shore by committing $300,000 under the Environment Restoration Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another local Central Coast based initiative is Take 3 for the Sea, a local organisation leading the world in taking action on plastic pollution and waste. Their premise is simple and effective—ask anyone who visits a beach or waterway to pick up three pieces of rubbish—and in 10 years the Take 3 for the Sea community has expanded to over 300,000 people in 129 countries. I take this opportunity to recognise the work of co-founder Tim Silverwood, who is stepping down from the role of CEO to work as a Take 3 ambassador. The Take 3 initiative has grown significantly under his excellent leadership, and I look forward to working with his replacement, Sarah Beard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, Australia must invest in technology and innovation in the plastic recycling industry, and the Morrison government is leading the way to make this vision a reality. We have an incredible opportunity to make plastic recycling a cornerstone of growing our economy and creating our jobs while reducing our negative impact on the planet.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Unfortunately, I am again providing an update to the House on the ongoing crisis in aged care—in this instance, residential home-care packages. The provision of both residential and home care for the elderly is important for me as I represent the sixth-oldest electorate in the country. My constituents are suffering because of the total failure of the government to respond to the crisis in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue that I've been familiar with for many years is constituents being granted home-care packages but being unable to find a service provider. Recently my office has been contacted by constituents who've been contacted by the company who provides their home, garden and maintenance assistance and were told, because they were oversubscribed, they would no longer be able to provide the service. They have referred them to other services, who are also oversubscribed, which means they are being placed on a waiting list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are elderly people, and in many cases vulnerable people, who have relied on a service and, because of the chronic underfunding of CHSP packages—particularly home care, maintenance and domestic assistance packages—are now without a service. Home care and maintenance for these constituents is often lawn mowing. They simply are not in a position to do this job, hence they qualify for the package. Now they have no-one to mow their lawns, and this is causing them considerable distress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue has recently been brought to my attention by Lynn and Doug from Macquarie Hills. I know Doug because he's a veteran and I have met him several times at Cardiff RSL ceremonies. When Doug became unable to do the lawn, Lynn took over. Then, because of her arthritis, she couldn't continue, and they were fortunate to get a level 1 package for home care and maintenance, which covered the lawn mowing. Now this service has been suddenly taken away from them and they are stranded on a waiting list with no-one to do their lawns. Because of Lynn's arthritis and Doug's heart and diabetes issues, they can't mow the lawn, nor should they have to. It's just not right that in 21st century Australia elderly people who have contributed to our society for decades—in Doug's case, serving in our Defence Force—are not getting basic yet important services which help them to remain at home, or, worse, have them and then have their services unexpectedly stopped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to raise the issue of the ongoing delays with the granting of home-care packages. John at Eleebana has recently been in contact. John is the carer for his elderly wife, who, sadly, has dementia. John's wife is on a level 1 package but has been approved for a level 3 package, which they have been told by their service provider won't be available until early next year. This will be a wait of two years since she was approved for the level 3 package. John is a very elderly man and has explained the basic assistance he gets from the level 1 package and how exhausted he is attending to all the other caring work, which he should not have to do and wouldn't be doing if they were getting the care under a level 3 package. This is just another shocking example of elderly Australians not being provided the home care they are entitled to. I've written to the minister and asked that urgent extra funding be provided for Commonwealth home support packages for the Hunter region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These home-care issues are just another example of the government's complete neglect of aged care. Recently it wanted to privatise the ACAT system, which is outrageous. It is literally the only part of the aged-care system that is working, and this government tried to ruin it by privatising it. I applaud the member for Monash, who has called out the government on this shameful attempt to again flog off essential services that are the duty of the state to provide, not the private sector, at a bargain price. No doubt a company with links to the Liberal Party would have been interested in this tender, as is the case with the privatisation of the visa system, which is probably going to go to one of the Prime Minister's good mates, Scott Briggs, who made several large donations to the Liberal Party. This is endemic of the way this government operates. It is a government run by the Liberal Party for the benefit of the Liberal Party and its donors, and the home-care system is another example of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government may, in the next budget, make more announcements about more home-care packages, as they did in the last budget, but, as in that case, it didn't keep up with the growing demand for these packages. Home-care packages provide dignity for elderly Australians. They allow them to remain in their family home, which is important for dignity and comfort in retirement and is cheaper for the taxpayer. But the impact of underfunding and a lack of service providers is having a significant impact on my elderly constituents. Labor and I will continue to hold the government to account for their outrageous neglect of such an important group in our society. We have a compact with elderly Australians. They are entitled to a dignified retirement, a retirement where they are supported by the state. Unfortunately, this government is failing in that obligation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  The live animal export industry and its supply chain support many communities across my electorate of O'Connor. These communities supply over 65 per cent of sheep exported from WA to the Middle East. In the past two years the industry has worked hard to improve its public image and increase transparency so that it can continue to supply quality Australian produce to our Middle Eastern markets. Recent changes to maximise animal welfare include: reducing the mortality rate threshold to one per cent, noting that recent mortalities have been as low as 0.1 per cent; using allometric stocking density, providing up to 40 per cent more space for sheep; independent verification of air turnover within pens; and independent observers on board all livestock export vessels, at the exporter's expense. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The three-month disruption to the trade in 2018 was followed in 2019 with a moratorium over the northern summer, which was extended by three weeks to 22 September. Two years on there has not been a single heat-stress event, and industry continues to work towards upgrading their vessels and maximising animal welfare on board. This has not been without considerable cost. The recently released Mecado report estimates that $83.6 million was lost by the industry in 2018, equating to $37.6 million for farmers at the farm gate, and in 2019 the industry lost $65.8 million, with the farmgate cost being $29.6 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These economic impacts flow through to industries like the livestock transport operators, who averaged losses of 35 to 50 per cent, with some single operators losing as much as 85 per cent; shearing services, with a full year's workload condensed into eight months; fodder manufacturers, who rely on the live export trade for more than 90 per cent of their revenue; and stock agents and sheep buyers, who are paid on commission. Vets, stock handlers, stevedores, shipping services and other port operators are also affected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to report to the House that the shipping practices that have been put in place are having a very positive impact. In 2019, mortality rates were 54 per cent below the historic season average from 2013 to 2017. Unfortunately, despite the willingness of industry to comply with regulation, there is a growing feeling of disconnect between the industry and government. This is demonstrated in the latest shipment of 65,000 sheep, which left from Fremantle to the Middle East, by Rural Export &amp; Trading WA. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Shuwaikh</span> was scheduled for decommissioning in line with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority phase-out of two-tier vessels by 2023. After the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> incident, this was brought forward to January 2020, leaving RETWA struggling to fill orders while retrofitting one vessel and acquiring a new vessel to meet compliance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">RETWA applied to AMSA in late 2019 in an effort to secure an exemption for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Al Shuwaikh</span> in the interim. RETWA also submitted the requisite animal welfare plan to the department of agriculture in mid-December, which was approved on 11 February 2020. An exemption to AMSA Marine Order 43 was ultimately granted on 7 February 2020 but excluded the only single-tier deck on the ship. The exporter and vessel owner had treated their exemption application as 'whole of ship' only to find their best ventilated, single-tier deck had been excluded from carrying any livestock at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emergency communication was exchanged between me and the Deputy Prime Minister's office on 18 February. Despite a directive from the Deputy Prime Minister that AMSA urgently communicate with the exporter about this imminent shipment, they failed to contact RETWA. One week later, AMSA did make contact, but with the wrong shipping service. Meanwhile, the ship sailed two days later at 8 pm on 20 February with no cattle or sheep on the best ventilated deck on the boat. Six hundred and thirty-six cattle and over a thousand sheep were returned to the feedlot at a loss to the exporter of over $1 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 21 February I wrote to Minister Littleproud, citing the above as an example of the problems industry are having with the timely approval of paperwork critical to meeting their commitments to overseas markets. I conveyed that exporters perceived a serious disconnect between the Canberra based regulator and the on-ground realities of the live animal export trade. I requested that Minister Littleproud consider relocating senior regulatory staff to key live export ports as a logical step in the government's decentralisation agenda. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concerns extend to the whole live export supply chain, which starts in the farming communities of my electorate of O'Connor. I believe a better understanding of the on-ground challenges faced by exporters and those right down the supply chain will help the development and maintenance of a viable live animal export industry that is transparent and consistently demonstrates positive animal welfare outcomes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I want to raise in the parliament today the matter of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a terrible condition which impacts too many young men. Sunday before last, I attended the New South Wales Community Walk 4 Duchenne with the member for Macarthur, Mike Freelander, Senator Deb O'Neill and a range of state members of parliament, including Sophie Cotsis and Jihad Dib. It was a great day and it was important to raise the profile of muscular dystrophy, Duchenne in particular, and we need to do so in this parliament as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Duchenne is a type of severe muscular dystrophy which begins very early in a young man's life. It can be diagnosed very early but has an increased impact as the young man develops and grows. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy generally, sadly, are not expected to live past their 20s. They can live into their 30s with the very best medical care but they are not generally expected to live past their 20s. They know about this through their life and they know about it from a very early age. It's the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood, impacting approximately one in every 5,000 male births, with about 20,000 new cases each year worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the walk I spent time with Ollie. Ollie is a friend of mine. He's nine years old. He was diagnosed with Duchenne at the age of 10 weeks. He of course is dealing with this condition, and his family is making a big contribution. They've started a charity, HopeforOllie. His dad, Tim McPhail, and his mum, Trish McPhail, run the charity, which provides children's clothing and accessories, and the profits go to the clinical trials undertaken at Westmead Children's Hospital, which is a very important initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community Walk 4 Duchenne, which was led by Elie Eid, who very famously walked to Canberra with his son Emilio to raise the profile of Duchenne, was an important day. I want to, as the member for McMahon and shadow minister for health, thank all those involved in the Save Our Sons Duchenne Foundation. The sponsors of the event included Chemist Warehouse, which should be acknowledged as they play a good role, and St John's Ambulance, who supplied the support and first aid on the day of the event, which should also be acknowledged, as they do across many events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Duchenne is a terrible condition, one of the many rare conditions facing Australians. But what honourable members might not realise is that there are more than 7,000 rare conditions in Australia which actually, when they're added up, impact on millions of Australians. Rare diseases are actually not rare enough because, in and of themselves, they might impact a very small number of people but when you add them up they impact many. It's very difficult for rare conditions to get the attention for research funding. They need more research funding. They have my attention and I hope the attention of the parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  On Monday the Federal Court handed down yet another series of fines to our friends in the CFMMEU. Fines to the value of some $486,500 were handed down to the CFMMEU and five officials. Now, this was the fifth-largest fine that the CFMMEU have received since 2016, and in that time they have racked up $17 million in fines for absolutely recalcitrant behaviour. Those opposite shake their heads. It's very interesting—$17 million in fines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Llew O'Brien, you know that once upon a time in my history I was actually a builder by trade, so I know their modus operandi. One of the most important parts of a building site or a building construction project is when you pour concrete. What the CFMMEU do is blockade the gates of the building site, and this is what they did to receive these fines. They do this when they're either about to start a pour or doing a pour. This costs the project millions of dollars, depending of course upon the size of the project. It also costs mum-and-dad subcontractors who are working on that site lost time in wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this building site, the Barangaroo site, the CFMMEU harassed and prevented people from entering the site when they were doing this pour. They hurled abuse at anybody who tried to get into the building site, calling them 'effing scabs' and 'filthy dogs'. Official Luke Collier knowingly encouraged illegal action saying, 'Don't worry, boys, there's not enough coppers here to take us all away.' Officials were attempting to coerce De Martin &amp; Gasparini into a CFMMEU approved enterprise bargain agreement. Judge Nicholas Manousaridis said that, while officials admitted their illegal behaviour, they showed absolutely no signs of contrition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just have a think about how much money the CFMMEU donate to the Labor Party. They donate, on average, $1 million to the Labor Party every single year, and the Labor Party continue to take their money—their blood money, which is exactly what it is. Those opposite and everybody else in here rightly condemn domestic violence, but it's time for those opposite to condemn industrial violence, which is done by the CFMMEU on an industrial— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  While the parliament was sitting last week I received devastating news about a wonderful local lady and Wollongong City Council Labor councillor who passed away suddenly. Vicky King was a very well-regarded local and it was just devastating to hear the news that she had passed away last Tuesday. My thoughts, and I'm sure the thoughts of the community I represent, are with her family: her husband, Charlie; their children, Peter, Sylvia, David, Clare, Hanna and Matika; and her seven grandchildren. As a grandparent, Vicky and I would often share grandparent-boasting stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vicky served and advocated for our community for 19 years as a councillor. She joined council in 1987 and remained a councillor until 2004. She was re-elected to council in September 2017. She was a passionate advocate for our community, and in particular the residents of the ward she represented in the southern suburbs. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span> has told great stories about Vicky taking her children to council with her. She was a trailblazer not only for women but also for mums in public life, and that was a groundbreaking action. She has always been a proud mum with funny stories about her children and grandchildren, who she loved very dearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was a member of the Port Kembla branch of the Labor Party, and their president, Michael Wilson, has provided me with a statement from the branch that I'd like to put on the record. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Vicky will long be remembered as a woman of vision and boundless energy who loved and respected her friends and served her community with skill and commitment. She was fundamental to the Labor movement in the Illawarra and a champion for women in leadership roles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Vicky was a committed supporter of social justice in our society and a force to be reckoned with as she consulted with her residents and brought forward their needs. Vicky served our Branch and her community for a long time and was passionate about the southern suburbs of Wollongong. Her commitment contributed to a range of infrastructure and services that we all enjoy and benefit from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will miss her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly share those sentiments of the Port Kembla branch and the Labor Party membership across our local area. It was such shocking news, because we had no idea that we were about to hear that Vicky had passed. We were so proud of the work she was doing on council and her work in many community organisations that she'd been involved with, always standing up for somebody who wasn't able to stand up for themselves. Vicky was a tigress if she got onto your cause and campaign. She absolutely was motivated to stand up for people who couldn't do that for themselves. She made us very proud and she'll be terribly, terribly missed. We all extend our sympathy to her family.</span>

In my role as a representative of Mallee I am committed to the right of all people to access quality health care, regardless of their postcode. I will not be silent on this issue until the people of Mallee can access the health care they need and to which they have a right, and until health facilities in Mallee reflect the dignity that belongs to its people. Until the needed quota of healthcare professionals is sustainably established in Mallee, I will not be silent. At this present moment in Mallee there is a shortage of hundreds of GPs, specialists and allied and primary health professionals. In addition, Mallee healthcare professionals are working in some of the worst facilities that I have visited.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk today specifically about the Swan Hill hospital. I visited Swan Hill hospital recently and was given a tour by the CEO, Peter Abraham, and Rosanne Kava, the president of the board of Swan Hill District Health. They took me through the entire hospital, including the emergency department. Please imagine with me a 1960s facility that services patients beyond its capacity, in cramped quarters, where there is little privacy, where staff computers scarcely fit on a side bench, where patients sometimes must receive results in the waiting room because there is a lack of cubicle space, and where the staff eating area is a walkway where a maximum of two staff can sit for their tea break, which ambulance staff must walk through to find the storage area, where they lean on boxes when writing up their notes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these discouraging conditions, what I can say is that the staff of the Swan Hill emergency department are passionate and committed to providing excellent care for the people of Swan Hill. This hospital ED is worse than tired, and I'm so proud of the attitude of the CEO, the head of ED and the staff who work every day in very difficult circumstances. I applaud their professionalism and their commitment to the wellbeing of the people of Swan Hill and surrounding communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that our government is committed to a $30 million investment in this hospital, but the hospital needs much more. I urge the Victorian state Labor government to look beyond the 100-kilometre radius of Melbourne suburbs and invest in this hospital and indeed in the people of regional Victoria, who deserve much better than this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  Having a disability makes life hard enough, but if you're 65 or older it can be a disaster, because older Australians are not allowed to enter the National Disability Insurance Scheme. If this sounds like blatant age discrimination, it's because it is. In fact, in 2013 the federal Labor government had to exempt the NDIS from the operation of the Age Discrimination Act, just to get it through the parliament. Let's not kid ourselves. Excluding older people from the NDIS was driven by concern for the budget bottom line, not the public interest. This has caused great disadvantage for people with disabilities. Indeed, my office was recently approached by a constituent who missed out on joining the NDIS because she was 66 years old, but, bizarrely, her sister, who is a couple of years younger and has the same disability, is entitled to the NDIS. In other words, the sister has access to assistive devices and the allied health and disability support providers of her choice, but the constituent doesn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also been approached by a constituent who runs a social enterprise in Hobart, employing people with a disability. Unsurprisingly, he's concerned too that his older staff are being denied the same level of support for household tasks and social activities as their younger colleagues, and he wants to know what's being done to help them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the case of Chris English, who became a quadriplegic at 69. Because Chris was too old for the NDIS, he entered the aged-care system and was assessed as requiring the highest level of care. However, this is only worth around $50,000 a year, which doesn't come close to covering his needs. If he'd been eligible for the NDIS, he'd receive around $300,000. Chris and his family were behind the petition the member for Warringah tabled in the House recently which called on the government to allow older people with a disability to access the NDIS. In response, the minister argued the NDIS is not intended to replace services already provided through the health or aged-care systems. But this is obviously nonsense because the aged-care system simply isn't designed to care for people with a disability and doesn't offer anywhere near enough support, such as access to technology and activities that allow people to stay at home, to be employed and to enjoy a social life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all just a moment away from relying on disability care, and it's only fair that we all should receive the same level of support. Frankly it's shameful and avoidable that a young person with a disability is eligible for the NDIS while an older person is condemned to a poorer quality of life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  Since sharing my personal story of family and domestic violence, I've had an outpouring of emails and phone calls from around Australia, and also from within Cowan, from people who are also sharing their stories. So I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge them here today. The people who have contacted me—mostly women—are from all age groups. There have been some men who have contacted me with their stories as well. Some are still in the process of leaving an abusive relationship and getting their lives back on track, and others are in their 70s and 80s and experienced abuse in their early 20s. But whether the abuse and the violence happened last week or last century, all spoke to me of the indelible scars it has left on their wellbeing and on their mental and physical health. All have given me permission to share their stories but I will change their names.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most harrowing stories that I read was that of Wendy, who is now 75. In her early 20s she was married to a man who she describes as 'a monster'. She tried to leave him many times but got very little support. When she finally did leave him, he found her and in the middle of the night went into her home and raped her, and then abducted their baby daughter. When she went to the police nobody believed her. Wendy ends her message, with this: 'I am affected each time women and children are murdered. I hope you will take note of what I say.' I have personally written back to Wendy and assured her that I have taken note of what she says.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also had correspondence from domestic violence support groups and refuges pleading for better funding so that they can continue to provide services for women who are leaving abusive and violent marriages and partnerships. The Southern Domestic Violence Action Group in Adelaide tells me that the Liberal South Australian government has defunded and closed all services for women experiencing domestic violence, including second level services for prevention and support, such as counselling and trauma counselling, except for women identified as high risk for murder or serious assault. So unless a woman identifies as this demographic—and I can tell you from my own personal experience that that is a big ask on a woman who is leaving a relationship—there are no counselling services available for them. The group has initiated a campaign called Southern Women Matter to reinstate all services to women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of Western Australia, the WA Minister for Prevention of Family and Domestic Violence has raised the issue of the safe places funding, which doesn't provide ongoing funding. I seek bipartisan support in addressing this issue. Let's keep this going. Let's keep talking about this. Let's actually do something as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I rise today to speak of two women in my electorate of O'Connor who are making outstanding contributions to their respective communities. Both of these well-deserving women, Susan Findlay from Albany and Christiane Smith from Esperance, were recognised earlier this year by their communities, being chosen as citizens of the year for 2020. Esperance Citizen of the Year, Christiane, is the secretary of Farmers Across Borders—Hay from WA, which coordinated several charity hay runs from WA to drought affected communities on the east coast. Christiane is an active member of the Quarry Road bushfire brigade, protecting her community from devastating fires when the need arises. In addition to these impressive pursuits, Christiane is also vice-chair of Moving Movies Esperance. She's a volunteer broadcaster at Hope FM. She is talented musician and has served on the board of the Esperance Care Services, which is a wonderful organisation, which I have supported right through my time in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sue Findlay is another woman to receive well-deserved recognition. She has a long history of dedication to the Albany community. Sue is the director of the Albany City Wind Ensemble and the founder and musical and creative director of About FACE youth choir. Sue has an enthusiasm for developing the musical skills of others and a passion for initiating authentic performance opportunities for youth. Sue is rapidly becoming a sought after industry figure for choral and performance collaboration, having been approached by both interstate and international musical groups, such as the Sydney Male Choir, the Pennsylvania Girlchoir and the WA Opera. About FACE, initiated by Sue to fill the gap in regional support services for youth, is now a recognised community asset, providing a supportive place for youth to be engaged as members of their community. Excitingly, About FACE, directed by Sue, will be representing Australia at the International Youth Music Festival in Bratislava later this year. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank and recognise both Sue and Christiane for their outstanding contributions enhancing the life of our regional communities. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Last Saturday was an important milestone in our recovery on the New South Wales South Coast. Every day I am reminded how, as a community, we are strongest when we stand together. On Saturday we did just that, to celebrate the reopening of Mogo zoo. The Mogo zoo is a local icon, so it was no wonder that their stories of the bushfires resonated with us so much. We have all heard the stories of how director Chad Staples and 15 of his staff spent a terrifying New Year's Eve defending the zoo from the fire. Keeping the animals safe was their priority. These staff had simply gone to work one day and not been able to leave, but they had their bushfire plan and they saved the zoo. They even managed to deliver a gorgeous baby lion cub in the midst of all that chaos—a Phoenix rising from the ashes indeed. They all did an extraordinary job and deserve our thanks and praise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the honour of attending the reopening ceremony and community day on Saturday, ahead of their official opening on Sunday, and what a magnificent day it was. Everyone who attended had, in some way, helped and supported the zoo, and there was a fantastic community turnout to celebrate this step forward in our recovery. Sherrie, a local Aboriginal woman, delivered a very moving welcome to country, where she told her own terrifying story of the fire. I have met Sherrie on many occasions, and she is a remarkable woman. We heard a beautiful rendition of the Australian anthem by Timothy Franklin, a flautist and young son of the local Franklin family that, devastatingly, lost everything in the fire. Well done, Tim; you did an amazing job. As a stunning symbol of resilience, the zoo unveiled a plaque to commemorate the occasion, on a sizable piece of wood crafted from a large burnt tree—a beautiful but meaningful reminder of all we have been through. Thank you so much to Chad and the team for having me. And thank you to all the wonderful volunteers as well, who turned out to guide visitors through the park and give us meaningful facts about the animals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mogo zoo is back open for business, so come and visit. Say hello to beautiful baby Phoenix. Check out the largest collection of primates in Australia, and see the zebras, rhinos and giraffes wander the savanna plains. While you are there, grab some fudge from the fudge shop or a delicious pie from Mogo Pies. Have a coffee at Grumpy and Sweethearts or pick up a plant from the nursery. Why not stop into Indo Direct to pick up a bowl just like the one Albo gave to the Indonesian President? There is so much to see and do. We are open and waiting for you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  The Goldstein community are mindful of the environment. They believe in taking responsibility and in seeing the opportunity that can be realised from low-carbon technology and other types of innovation and recycling and to improve our local environment, our community, our state, our nation and our world. That's why intellectual property matters, because intellectual property goes to the heart of innovation; it's about encouraging investment so that people want to build a better future, and to invest, to innovate, to create, to grow and to be part of the solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last year alone, $7.7 billion or $308 per person was invested in new renewable energy projects in Australia, making us a world leader on a per capita basis. This demonstrates the Morrison government's commitment to cutting emissions without cutting jobs or introducing new taxes—the proposals put forward by those on the other side of this chamber, who have learned nothing from their electoral loss or, of course, their deception in the lead-up to the 2010 election where they said they weren't going to support a carbon tax and then came into the chamber and voted for it. They continue to insist that that is the only way to reduce emissions in Australia, but that is just a falsehood, because of course their only way to solve it is to burden small businesses and Australians with crippling new taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the discussion surrounding emissions reduction focuses on the role of government. That is actually a distraction, because the real issues come down to what we can do in enabling private enterprise, capital mobilisation and innovation to grow the future of the economy and create low-carbon tech alternatives. As Robert Menzies said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The true answer is to be found in co-operation; government doing … what private enterprise cannot reasonably be expected to do, and private enterprise doing … what no Government Department could hope to do …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Goldstein, we believe that private enterprise and property rights empower individuals to turn creative pursuits into products and services which can fundamentally improve society, the economy and the environment. Intellectual property rights provide citizens the opportunity to profit from their creative expression, granting them the exclusive rights to the fruits of their labour and their innovation. The process rewards those who try and empowers them, and it ultimately dissuades people who don't have good ideas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I am pleased to rise today to talk about our community's disaster risk reduction. Frankly, nothing could be more timely than this discussion as the end of this summer nears—and a terrible summer it has been. 'Harrowing' is the word that springs to mind when I speak with the many people who share their terrible stories with me. That is what it has been—absolutely harrowing. This government did nothing to prepare for this disaster. They have done nothing to keep our community safe from disaster. They did not listen when, time and time again, the experts warned them about the dangers that were coming. They did not reduce the risk by making sure we had the resources and equipment to respond quickly. They were too slow to respond—and they have been missing in action ever since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fires in my electorate started in November. By the time of the last week in this place last year, I had an overwhelming feeling that something was terribly wrong, that our community was at risk and this was not good. All of my instincts were to leave—to go back to the New South Wales South Coast and be with my community. On 3 December, I did leave. And from that day on, for as long as those fires were raging and for all the time since, I have been on the ground with my community. For the 10 weeks until I returned to this place, every day I had been talking with local people and hearing the stories. Perhaps if the government had been doing the same, they wouldn't stand here with platitudes and promises about plans and risk reduction. They would know that we were not prepared and we did not respond how we should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be very clear about this: I have no criticism of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service workers. I have no criticism of the district managers, the emergency services personnel or anyone on the ground fighting this fire. Our RFS workers are our heroes. They have done an incredible job, in very difficult circumstances, fighting every day to keep our community safe. They have felt the pain of our community with us. I have said it many times but I will say it again: from the bottom of my heart I thank every one of our RFS crews, our emergency service workers and volunteers for everything they have done. But these amazing crews that have done amazing things were put in harm's way by this government because the government did not listen. The government stubbornly refused to take advice from experts and they let this fire season take hold like never before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Currowan fire, the one that started it all and eventually split into four different fires, burned on the New South Wales South Coast for 74 days. It began on 26 November and it rapidly got out of control. And my community is still coming to grips with all that happened next. When I met with Gerry, a farmer from Conjola, I was struck by how his words resonated with what so many people had been saying. Gerry talked about how volunteers and the community have stepped in where the government should be. It is the community who have led our response to this crisis, not the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has for months refused to listen to the experts. The Prime Minister refused to meet with the former fire chiefs who warned we were headed for disaster and needed to take action. I had the pleasure of meeting one of these former fire chiefs. He is running the community response in Lake Conjola. I met him at the community centre there. Peter Dunn, the retired ACT emergency services commissioner, stood up with other prominent leaders, like former commissioner Greg Mullins, in December and said the government was asleep at the wheel, that we were at risk and that we needed action now. But the Prime Minister refused to listen, and the government has remained asleep at the wheel. While our communities are suffering, the government's response has been slow. It has been inadequate and it has left so many people—in the words again of Gerry—feeling 'traumatised' by their government. It is the community, not the government, that is leading this response, and the government could learn so much from what the community has to say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A great example from my community is the Kangaroo Valley Community Bushfire Committee. The committee formed 18 months ago, after they saw a gap in the government's disaster plan. They put together a bushfire community plan. They split the community up into nine neighbourhoods and they appointed a coordinator. They knew in advance which families would be staying in the event of a fire and which would be leaving. They knew who would need help and where they could get it. The committee had their UHF radios so they could communicate with each other. In a community where mobile phone reception can be unreliable, this is critical. They were ready and they, no doubt, saved lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with one of their members, Matt, recently. One of the things that Matt wanted to raise were concerns about the Hampden Bridge and what he saw as the fire approached. The Hampden Bridge is essential for the Kangaroo Valley community. Like many communities on the New South Wales South Coast, there is one road in and one road out. In the valley, this road requires the bridge. But the government has no plan for the Hampden Bridge. There is no water resource. There is no risk management, only ad hoc reactive attempts to protect it—this historic bridge is an important access point, and there's no plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an isolated incident. When I visited the Sussex Inlet community on the day that the road into Sussex reopened, I heard how people had to be taken by dinghy across the inlet to St Georges Basin where the evacuation centre was. Again, there's one road in and one road out. That meant, when the fire came, they were cut off. There are many stories like this: so many of my communities had to fend for themselves when the roads were cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the fires came, they quickly knocked out large parts of our electricity network. In our evacuation centres, where hundreds of people were told to go, there was no power, and there was no back-up power—no generators, no way of keeping the lights on and no way of keeping people cool in the searing 40 degree heat. In Ulladulla, the evacuation centre got lucky. The Stardust Circus was in town and it had generators. It was thanks to the luck of the circus, not the risk reduction of the government, that the lights stayed on in Ulladulla's evacuation centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people further down south were not so lucky. The evacuation centre in Moruya was a basketball stadium and simply not fit for purpose. It has no air conditioning and no insulation. I have heard terrible stories from people evacuated there about the conditions they endured. Again, it was the community looking after each other that made the difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no plan for people with a disability, who were turned away from those centres and turned away from the hospitals, left with nowhere to go. I met with local disability advocacy group roundsquared. They stepped into this space, helping their clients where they could, making sure they were safe. They told me terrible stories about what they saw.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Currowan fire was split for the first time and the Clyde Mountain fire was born, an emergency operation centre was established in Moruya. When the Princes Highway finally reopened, I visited the centre and was sorely disappointed by what I saw. The Eurobodalla does not have a dedicated emergency operation centre, so staff trying to deal with a crisis on a magnitude never seen before were using a community hall. They were working on trestle tables. This is just not good enough. The government talks about risk reduction, but, in a time of crisis, our community did not have the basics necessary to respond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken many times over the last few weeks about this government's slow response to the bushfires. The minister's statement talked about the government's $2 billion commitment and the national disaster recovery fund. That sounds like a lot of money, but the question is simple: where is the money? I speak with people in my community every day and this is what they are asking. This is what I am asking. When will they actually see this money on the ground? Our community has had enough of empty promises and empty rhetoric from the Morrison government. They need to see action now; they can't afford to wait.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr McCormack:</span>
                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) (a) The Second National In-Service Emission study was commissioned by the then Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. The Australian Government has not commissioned any in-service emissions testing studies since that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, through the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, uses data from a range of Australian and international studies to inform its estimates of in-service vehicle emissions in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) No. However, the Government is considering ways to improve the integrity of emissions testing so that it is more representative of real world driving. This includes engaging with international regulators through the United Nations (UN) World Forum for the Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations, who are seeking to improve control of real world emissions by adopting improved test procedures, including a new on-road 'real driving emissions' test for noxious emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) (a) Yes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) During public consultation on Euro 6 in 2016-17, a number of light vehicle manufacturers advised that their Euro 6 engines would not be compatible with current petrol quality in Australia. This is due to the higher levels of sulfur and aromatics permitted in petrol in Australia compared with other countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 February 2019, the Government announced that petrol quality will be improved by setting a lower pool average for aromatics from 2022 and lowering the sulfur limits from 2027.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(c) The Government has discussed options for introducing Euro 6 in Australia with key stakeholders, including vehicle manufacturers and motoring groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(d) The Government is considering undertaking further formal consultation in 2020. </span>
