                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Leader of the </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I understand that, pursuant to an order agreed by the Senate, I have been asked to attend the chamber in relation to a number of government responses to Senate Environment and Communications References Committee reports tabled across a period of time. This order notes the approach—since 1973, it says—that government responses to committee reports seek to be tabled or be tabled within three months of a report being finalised. I note that there has probably been a wide variation in terms of the handling of that since 1973, whether it be Labor or Liberal governments' compliance with that. I note that in that time frame there would be many such committee reports that have lapsed in different ways in terms of their relevance as a result of the passage of time and other matters along the way, and of course I'm pretty confident that the volume of committee reports being made by the Senate is probably much greater today in 2022, and in recent years, than it was back in 1973.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, I can advise the Senate in relation to some of the reports that have been identified in the motion passed by the Senate that work has been underway to respond to those reports. The government responses to the National Landcare Program and to the regulation of the finfish aquaculture industry in Tasmania are indeed being tabled today. And I'm sure that there will no doubt be a sense of interest from senators in relation to their contributions on Landcare—an important and very much valued program across Australia. Landcare is a program that our government has very strongly, passionately and enthusiastically supported in a range of different ways, and the finfish aquaculture industry in Tasmania is a sector that I imagine my colleague Senator Duniam is much better placed to address the merits and challenges of than I am, necessarily.</span>

                    </a>  And, yes, I am certain that Senator Whish-Wilson will have much to say on a matter such as that. So I'm sure those government responses on those two matters are no doubt going to be eagerly anticipated by the Senate and, of course, I'm sure they will add enormous value to the debate in relation to such matters. But I know that, no doubt, when I conclude speaking there will be a rather predictable take note motion that will be moved and there will be a degree of faux outrage that will come.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Hanson-Young, I know, is very good at turning up the dial when she needs to have a degree of outrage. I think there's a little knob under Senator Hanson-Young's desk somewhere so she can work out which level of outrage she wants to flick to on the outrage machine. So she'll have her degree of outrage. Perhaps she'll have something to say about the finfish aquaculture industry as well. But, no doubt, there will be that approach taken from the crossbench, and probably from the opposition as well, notwithstanding the fact that I'm sure that, if we were to work our way through the period of their time in government, we would equally find many different committee reports that were not responded to within the 1973 standard of three months that I suspect governments of all persuasions have honoured more in the breach in that period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wouldn't want anybody to think that that means that Senate committee reports are any less valuable. The work of Senate committees is of crucial importance in a range of ways, and that of references committees has a unique role in terms of how they operate across our parliament. References committees of the Senator operate with a certain freedom and liberty to explore issues beyond the remit of specific legislation, and the unique aspect of references committees in this place is that they not only have freedom in terms of exploring issues beyond pure legislation presented to legislation committees but, of course, those references committees are constituted with a non-government balance in this place. Oftentimes that is a good thing. Those references committees with a non-government balance—I've been there, as chair of a references committee myself, back in the dark, dim days of opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  I bet you did a great job!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BIRMINGHAM:</span>
                    </a>  I think that Senator Cash would have been chair of a references committee too, Senator Stoker, and that she would have done a great job at that time. They are valuable opportunities for a constructive approach to be taken at times. However, there has been a bit of a trend over the years as well where references committees are sometimes abused. Because they have that non-government majority that they are constituted with, those references committees then operate in a way where they are used not so much for the legitimate analysis of the issues that are proposed, not so much for the pursuit of information and knowledge around those issues but instead for political purposes where a non-government controlled committee is able to pursue political attacks on the government rather than the purpose, original function and intent for which that references committee was established. I've noted that over the years there have sometimes even been attempts to have legislation referred to a references committee, if opposition parties of the day think they can get the numbers in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those approaches, when they are used in ways that undermine the intent of those references committees, can indeed be, I think, undermining of the overall benefits we have from the very powerful and important committee system in the Australian Senate. Now, there has been a little bit happening, as there usually is in sitting weeks and in the finance minister's life. I haven't had a chance to go and have a look over each of the 18 committee reports from the Environment and Communications References Committee myself.</span>

I just, in the last day or two, haven't had the chance to go and read the reports myself. I'm sure that in some parts they are valuable additions to public policy and debate. But I equally suspect that in other parts, especially given this references committee has for a period of time had a chair from the Greens, and I note Senator Hanson-Young's enthusiasm on this topic, it is probably the case that this committee's reports are somewhat laden with the Greens' view of the world, perhaps with the support of the Labor Party—a reminder of the type of Labor-Greens alliance that we could see after the next election, where their pursuit—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a display of disrespect for the institution of this chamber in reviewing government policy and looking into issues of serious matters concerning the community. The idea that, as senators, we should just sit back, be quiet and do whatever the government of the day likes is just laughable. That is not the role of the Australian Senate. Our role is to inquire, to ask tough questions and to hold government to account. That is precisely why this motion, this request for the minister to respond today, was moved. At the time this motion was put forward, there were 18 reports of the Environment and Communications References Committee that this government had arrogantly refused to respond to, despite the rules, requirements and respect set back in 1973. During those times it was a big debate about the role of this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arrogance of this government runs through everything, doesn't it? It's led from the top by Mr Morrison himself and it goes all the way down to Senator Birmingham, who is here today thinking that he doesn't have time, that it's not part of his job to have to read, consider and think about what his government's responses are to reports that are put forward by this chamber. Well, that's wrong. It is your job. If you want the gig of government, you take responsibility for copping accountability and scrutiny as delivered by this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems from the response of Senator Birmingham that, because governments past and current have been tardy in their response and accountability, they can be tardy now. They can be tardy in relation to responses to these serious and well-considered reports put forward by fellow senators in this place. This is the government of tardiness—spin, mistruth and tardiness—and we've just seen it from Senator Birmingham this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 18 reports that the Environment and Communications References Committee considered, inquired into and reported into and that require government responses, some of which go back to 2014. That's how tardy and arrogant the Morrison-Joyce government are. Yesterday, after this request for the minister to come and explain the arrogance, dismissal and lack of accountability of his government was clear, the Senate received responses to two of these reports. Imagine that! So, if we were to keep asking for these, maybe by the end of the next term, if they were to be re-elected, we'd get some more responses. That is not how this process is meant to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 18 reports with no response from this government, and why? It is because they do not believe they are accountable to anyone. They don't believe they're accountable to the people of Australia. They don't believe they're accountable to the chamber. They don't believe they're accountable to the institution of the Senate. This government, the Morrison-Joyce government, thinks that it's its way or the highway. They would like to write their own rules and not have to be accountable for anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know the attitude of Mr Morrison in all of this: nothing's ever his fault, it's always somebody else's, and then if he gets caught out he doesn't tell the truth. The reputation of this government is in tatters because it is unaccountable. They think they are above everybody. They are above the law, and that's led right from the top, from a Prime Minister who schemes and twists and thinks that everybody can be taken for a fool. There is no accountability and no transparency, and when you get caught out you do your hardest to cover it up or lie through your teeth. These are the hallmarks of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we lead into what is going to be the next federal election, there are only three sitting days of this chamber left. All this request asks is that this government finally do its job and respond to the hard work of the committees in this place, the witnesses who have put forward evidence and the members of the Public Service who have participated in these 18 different inquiries across different issues. Many of them, yes, have to do with the environment, an important issue to many and most Australians, and with issues in relation to our public broadcasters and the rules that govern media in this country—another issue that is important to our community. But, no, this government thinks that if it doesn't have the numbers on a committee to get the reports and the recommendations that it wants then, bugger it, it's not going to respond. It is arrogant, dismissive, sneaky. It is always looking to blame someone else and cover up when it gets caught out. These are the hallmarks of this government, and this has just been demonstrated again here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the eve of a federal election, when we have three siting days left of this chamber, the government has had an opportunity to come in and give some considered contribution to important issues that this chamber has debated, inquired into and worked on since 2014. Rather than taking that seriously, rather than being prepared to be held to account or to be transparent with the Australian people, we heard from the government minister that he didn't have time. He thumbed his nose at the democratic institution, the role of the parliament and the right of the Australian people to ensure that there is accountability and transparency of their government. There isn't a level of accountability that this government likes. Every which way they try and avoid it. Of course there was a promise that there was going to be an anti-corruption commission in this term of government. Where is it? It's not happening. And why? Because Mr Morrison and Mr Joyce don't want the scrutiny. They don't want to be held accountable. They don't want anybody looking into their affairs. They don't want to be held responsible for the dodgy deals that the government have made with their mates in business, in corporations—big developers who've been given the green light to damage and destroy our environment. This government has an allergic reaction to truth, to accountability and to transparency. You can't trust them on anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the smirk that frustrates and alienates the Australian people from the Prime Minister; it is his arrogance to think that he doesn't have to do his job and that he never owes anyone the truth. Well, this chamber is standing up today against that arrogance not for ourselves but for the Australian people. The display from the minister today and their pathetic response just proves why this government does not deserve another day in office.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  I rise also to take note and to make some remarks about the minister's contribution just now. You would think that this government, and indeed all senators in this chamber, would be seriously concerned and worried about the declining trust in politics. It is not an overstatement to say that this is a moment of crisis. Trust in Australian politics is at an all-time low. The 2019 Australian election survey, which is an important resource for every person here, showed that just one in four Australians are willing to express confidence in their political leaders and institutions. I find that terribly sad. I've spent much of my life in volunteer capacities seeking to contribute to Australian democratic institutions and to public debate. It's built on the idea that every Australian citizen has the ability to contribute, that every Australian citizen has the right to be heard and that the Australian parliament exists to safeguard those rights, to safeguard those interests and to ensure that we continue as a democratic community capable of taking important decisions for our nation together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over one in 10 Australians are willing to say that they think government operates for all people. That statistic alone should concern every person in this chamber. So, when a minister is asked to come to this place and explain why, since 2014, report after report after report that's been prepared by senators in this place has been ignored by the government, you would think he would do the Australian people the courtesy of providing a serious explanation because Senate inquiries are a serious political process. Senate inquiries offer the opportunity for ordinary people working alone, working in community organisations or working as researchers to provide a perspective on the questions that should be concerning us as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell you what: just at the human level, there might be a job for people in chamber—a job that the leader of the government here was willing to disparage and make mocking remarks about, with a little bit of: 'Ha, ha, ha! How funny it was back in the dim, dark days of opposition when we had to stoop to chairing committees!' Well, Minister, that's not the way everybody in this place treats committees. We treat them seriously and we know that the people who spend their time coming before us as witnesses take them seriously as well. These people spend hours writing submissions. Then we ask them to come to Canberra and provide evidence. We ask them to sit before us, to appear on television at times and to expose themselves to scrutiny. They come. They are willing to subject themselves and their evidence to our scrutiny. They sit before us and they answer questions. At times that's not comfortable for those witnesses, but they do it. Those ordinary Australians, those good citizens, do it because they believe that our democracy matters. They believe that the deliberative processes of the Senate matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is it that a minister, the leading representative of the government in this place, would have the temerity, the hubris and the arrogance to come into this chamber and treat a motion of this kind with contempt? He failed to respond to the original request to provide a response to all of these matters and has failed to provide a serious explanation for why they have done so. It's typical of the broader approach of this government, a government which shows disrespect to evidence and to experts on every policy decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It starts with the Prime Minister, doesn't it? I've given some thought in recent years as to why the Prime Minister seems so pathologically incapable of responding to the public interest, because I'm actually a person who's generally generous about the motivations of the people around me. I know that I don't agree with many of the people on the other side, but I'm willing to acknowledge that they come here in the spirit of public service. But I have racked my brains to understand what it is that drives the Prime Minister. We've have had some fairly recent free character assessments offered by some of the people who know him best. According to the man who now occupies the position of Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Morrison is, in fact, just a liar; according to the unnamed frontbencher, Mr Morrison is a psycho; and, according to former Premier Berejiklian, he's a horrible, horrible person who—and I think this is the kicker and the thing which explains it the most—puts politics before people.</span>

                    </a>  What is needed is a leader who is willing to take responsibility for the stewardship of this place, for its functioning and for its role in a democratic nation. He could start by committing to the ordinary processes of accountability, by responding to the reports provided by this place and by insisting that the ministers in his cabinet respond to the reports that are provided by senators in this place and that reflect the evidence provided by Australian citizens. He could follow up by keeping his promise to establish some kind of national integrity body—some kind of anticorruption commission—that can deal with the rorts and the scandals that have, sadly, proliferated under his watch.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He could, possibly, direct his people—his ministers and the public servants who work for them in executive government—to take the Senate estimates process seriously. We're going into estimates next week, and I tell you what: what's the bet that we'll see a repeat of the behaviour that we have seen intensify over the last three, four or five years under this government, where questions are taken on notice and then an irrelevant and meaningless answer is provided? Public servants nervously glance sideways at their minister to assess whether on this occasion they should just tell the truth about what is happening in a government program or whether there's some kind of punishment coming their way if they dare to speak up and actually explain what is happening in Australian public programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it's responding to references reports, establishing an anticorruption commission or dealing properly with the estimates process, this is a government that is allergic to scrutiny and accountability. A minister in this place hid behind a whiteboard rather than merely be photographed in an uncomfortable week for her. A minister went to the cricket rather than attend a Senate hearing into the crisis occurring in our aged-care facilities as a consequence of the pandemic. This is a government that ignores Auditor-General recommendations. This is a government that's willing to defend its car park rorts, its sports rorts and its decision to purchase land at many, many times its value. It sees no problem with that and has no questions to answer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So is it any surprise at all that it has no interest in the matters that have been considered by the Environment and Communications Committee since 2014? These are questions about direct action, about landcare, about finfish aquaculture, about online gambling and the harms it does to Australian families, and about climate change and its impact on fisheries and biodiversity. Do you all think that the Australian public don't care about this? Are these issues that you think aren't important? That is the very strong signal you are sending here. But worse—and I'll return to where I began—is your contempt for and lack of interest in securing and stewarding the health of Australian democratic institutions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  In my small home town of Launceston in northern Tasmania, we've broken yet another temperature record this summer. We had the driest December ever recorded, and yesterday it was reported in the media that an estimated 60,000 Atlantic salmon—finfish, an invasive species that is farmed in the Tamar River—died. There was a mass fish mortality, because the water has warmed to such an extent that the nitrogen levels underneath those fish pens have starved those fish of oxygen. Those fish literally choked and drowned in their own shit in those pens. That's a problem for the salmon company, but it's not just the Tamar River. We've seen hundreds and thousands of fish die in single events in Macquarie Harbour on the west coast of Tasmania. If you think that's a lot—Senator Duniam knows this—one of the companies, Tassal, lost over a million fish in a single event in the shallow waters of the Huon Valley. Why? Because our oceans are warming. Why am I raising this now? For two simple reasons. Two of the Senate inquiries that haven't been responded to, dating back to seven years ago, firmly warming oceans and the problems with finfish aquiculture in Tasmania on the national and federal political agenda. That's not to mention the amazing work the environment and comms committee did back in 2016 into the impacts of warming oceans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who in here doesn't think we've seen an unprecedented period of history where marine habitats have changed because of warming oceans? I honestly couldn't think of a more important issue in the environment than this. I'm a bit biased, because I spend a lot of time in the ocean and I care deeply about our marine ecosystems, but this is an issue that this chamber and this government have ignored. They have refused to respond to these inquiries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2015 finfish inquiry—and I thank Labor for their support; it was fellow Tasmanian Lisa Singh who convinced her colleagues in this place to support that inquiry—began because some secret documents were put under the Greens door in Hobart. There were leaked emails from two of the CEOs of the three salmon companies begging the state government to do their job and regulate the salmon industry. They said, 'It is a ticking time bomb if you don't act.' Companies begging for regulation—you don't see that very often. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a significant matter of national interest because Macquarie Harbour—where we did have a ticking time bomb; it's been an unmitigated disaster since 2015—has protected federal species and is on the edge of a World Heritage area. Eventually, we convinced the federal environment department, because of those threatened species, to go down there and talk to the environmental protection agency. Finally, we saw some action on destocking salmon in those harbours. The regulation of finfish and salmon aquaculture is a federal issue. Yet, this government has refused to take it seriously and now they are reaping the consequences of that, as is the Tasmanian community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another report that this government has sat on for six years is the report on the mitigation of shark bites in this country. It was one of the biggest Senate inquiries I've been involved in, and I'm very proud the Greens led on this one as well. We went all around the country and took evidence from small towns like Ballina in New South Wales, through to Sydney, Perth and northern Queensland. We listened to all the evidence and we pulled together the world's first inquiry into mitigating the risk of shark bites and how we can get the balance to protect our ecosystems. Sharks are critical to ocean health, yet we have these fisheries devices, like shark nets and drumlines, that are indiscriminately killing not just sharks; they are weapons of mass destruction for protected marine life, like turtles, rays and whales. That was a great body of work, but this government has never responded. There are a number of recommendations in that inquiry about, once again, how the federal government could show leadership on this issue. It is way past time for the federal government to show national leadership on this debate. We still see the media victimising sharks. We still see state governments, like those of New South Wales and Queensland, refusing to remove these last-century responses to what is a very complex problem that has much better solutions. And they're all in that report—if the federal government would just listen and pay attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, when we were holding this inquiry on great white sharks, which are a nationally protected species, there was a big push on to open up great white sharks to fishing all around this country. We saw Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister at the time, calling great white sharks the terrorists of the sea. I remember when Mr Frydenberg flew over to Western Australia and whipped the media into a frenzy to kill great white sharks. CSIRO did a report looking at the genetics of white shark populations and found that, contrary to the myths that this government was whipping up, shark populations aren't exploding in this country. In fact, they're not exploding; they're flatlining, at best, if not continuing to decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're still catching these protected species in shark nets. We're still catching whales. Senator Waters, who's from Queensland, knows that, every year, on the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, whales are getting entangled in these awful shark nets that are just designed to kill marine life for a false sense of security. We've recently had the tragic death of a surfer at Snapper Rocks and Greenmount, on the Gold Coast, bitten by a shark, inside a shark net. He probably had a false sense of security, like many surfers and ocean-goers do—that somehow you're safe if the shark nets are there. Well, you're not. Shark nets do not make you safe from shark bites. They are simply a fisheries device designed to reduce the population of sharks and other marine life. They're totally indiscriminate killers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could do so much better if we had federal leadership. I'm proud that the Greens have led on this issue, as they have with warming oceans, through this Senate committee, and as they have with trying to get some action on regulating toxic Atlantic salmon in the waterways of my home state of Tasmania. The Greens will continue to lead on these issues. Senator Duniam, I hope that you provide a response to this today and that we see some action from your government on this issue; I recognise that we are looking at Commonwealth waters and other ways of farming finfish, and you can be sure that I'm keeping a very close eye on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by saying what Senator Hanson-Young has said so eloquently already: the fact that we have 18 reports from a committee on the environment that haven't been responded to—many of them on critical issues like those I've outlined today—shows this government's contempt for the environment; it shows how low a priority it is on their agenda. There's been critical work done by good people, including the amazing people who work in the Senate committee—the secretariat and all the fantastic people—as well as all the witnesses around the country. There were hundreds of witnesses in the shark inquiry, and there were even further submissions. Yet we've done nothing. We've failed to respond and we've failed to show leadership on an issue that is a significant matter of public interest. This idea of shark bites, whether our oceans are safe and how we can better protect our marine environment is still one of the issues most talked about by Australians at their barbecues in summer. Let's get some responses before this parliament is finished so that we can give them to the people who went out of their way to make submissions and inform the evidence that we need for good policy and good decisions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's a committee that I used to be a member of. Indeed, I participated in some of the inquiries that Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Hanson-Young have spoken about. They've had their chance to say their piece, and we'll just leave that on the record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do want to turn my attention to one of those inquiries that Senator Whish-Wilson referenced—that is, the inquiry into the matter of finfish farming in Tasmania. That is something he did indicate to the Senate I would have a high level of interest in, and it is something that both he and I, along with Senator Urquhart and Senator McKim, as Tasmanians, have a strong interest in, albeit I expect Senator Urquhart and I are on a unity ticket with regard to the industry and not with Senator McKim and Senator Whish-Wilson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party support this industry in Tasmania that employs over 5,000 Tasmanians, predominantly in regional communities up the north-west, down the east coast and on the west coast. We talked about Macquarie Harbour and some of the issues that have occurred there. Down in the Huon Valley, it's a huge employer in that area. It's something that both Senator Urquhart and I take very seriously and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to this inquiry, I want to focus on the fact that this is about an industry in Tasmania, one that is regulated by the Tasmanian government and that occurs within the waters governed by the Tasmanian government and managed by the Tasmanian Environment Protection Authority and the department of primary industries, water and the environment. That's something under the terms of our Federation that's well and truly within the scope of the Tasmanian government, not the Australian government. The committee report notes that extensively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of recommendations that came out of the report. The three that I could see when I was having a look through this report were recommendations for the Tasmanian government to act. The last time I checked in this place, the parliament we're in is the Australian parliament, to which the Tasmanian government is not accountable. They are the ones that those recommendations relate to.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                    </a>  That's a ridiculous proposition and not related to this debate at all, Senator Patrick. My point is that we've got an inquiry that at the time it was established we know the Tasmanian division of the Labor Party did not support, but the inquiry went ahead. The reason they didn't support it is that they knew it was a stunt. They knew it was just another beat-up. They knew that it was something that was going to be weaponised to try to trash an industry that, while not perfect, does a very good job of managing our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry is proudly employing 5,000 people, something I support and want to see improved. If there are technological and regulatory improvements to be made in this industry, let's make them. Let's help them make them. That's why, rather than raking over some of these issues based on emotion, rather than fact and science, I'm keen to see what we can do within the Australian government's purview—that is, Commonwealth aquaculture. That's something you referenced, Senator Whish-Wilson—through you, Mr President—and I'm looking forward to having a science based, fact based discussion around what we can do to grow this industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't agree that these are a toxic, poisonous species of fish, as described by the previous speaker. These are a commodity farmed sustainably and one that we rely on for protein in diets and for economic support. This industry pays the wages of over 5,000 people. This is an important part of the Tasmanian economy and something that, as I said before—and I doubt Senator Urquhart would disagree with me—we in Tasmania are proud of. Ninety per cent of our population support that industry because they vote for the parties that actually support those 5,000 people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on comments made by those who are opposed to it, again, based on emotion, not science and fact. They're cherrypicking stats and data rather than looking at these things in the context of the truth. We end up with these horrible emotive debates, which we need to steer clear of. As I say, that's my priority. That's what I'll be doing as we head into this work. The Blue Economy CRC is a fantastic institution bringing scientists together with industry and people who want to grow that sector and do it well. We have to remember that those industries that operate in the finfish farming sector trade on brand. A lot of the evidence provided to that inquiry points to the fact that, in order to be successful in the marketplace, you have to be able to point to your record as environmental managers and ensure that you are doing the best you can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just turn to the government senators' additional comments. Of course, it was clear at the time that the government didn't support the establishment of this inquiry because, as I've already outlined, it's a matter for the Tasmanian government. Insofar as the Commonwealth of Australia is concerned, we are heading down that path with Commonwealth aquaculture. That's something I'm very excited about and it's something, Senator Whish-Wilson, I can promise you I will engage with you on directly. We've already talked about it in brief. As work continues, I hope you and I can find a unity ticket to support a well-established industry based on science that actually will be good for the environment and the economy.</span>

I assume that's something you would like to see, Senator Whish-Wilson. I would invite you at some point in the future to come and stand with Senator Urquhart and me, as Tasmanians, to support the growth of this industry in Commonwealth waters. I think that would be fantastic. Imagine doubling the size of the industry and having 10,000 Tasmanians employed in this industry! That would be fantastic. We could do it based on science. I'm going to take a little punt here—not that I'm a gambling man—but I don't reckon I'll get any unity with the Tasmanian contingent of the Australian Greens. I don't think they'll stand with me, no matter what the science says, and they won't be standing with Senator Urquhart either to support growth, no matter what the Blue Economy CRC says. I expect we will be facing opposition to growth in that sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go back to the government senators' additional comments. Obviously, the government was opposed to the inquiry because it would be used as a platform for anti-industry attacks. Quite clearly that was the case; it happened. We noted also that the Tasmanian division of the Labor Party didn't support the inquiry. The points made by the government senators include the fact that there were appropriate systems and regulatory frameworks in place but, most importantly, that it was a matter for the Tasmanian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's concern around the lack of response to this, but I think it's important to look at what has happened in Tasmania since that point in time, under the auspices of the Tasmanian government. They are the ones who are actually charged under regulation and legislation to regulate and manage that industry, to improve its future, to improve its impact on the environment and to ensure that it remains a strong industry. There have been a range of changes made to how they do business down there; not all of them, I have to say, have been supported by sections of the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter what we do, no matter how far we go to try and ensure an industry is sustainable, they will never ever be happy because trashing the brand of these businesses and the future livelihoods of these 5,000 Tasmanians who work in this industry is important for them, because it's about politics; just like this report was about politics. It's not about actually improving the future for Tasmanians and making sure that regional communities can survive. Senator Urquhart and I—and I hope she would never disagree with me on this—stand for those jobs. They are based on sustainable practices and science, and they improve every year. Every year those businesses get better at what they do. We support them to ensure that they can continue to improve and provide that important commodity to the Australian marketplace and, of course, exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, none of this is about committee report responses; it's about politics, it's about division and it's about running down Tasmanian jobs and businesses. I say to those who keep doing this and who keep highlighting divisions and trying to run these entities down: stop it. It's not what the majority of Tasmanians and, indeed, Australians want. They want us to get on with creating conditions that are actually supportive of jobs and creating environmental outcomes that are based on science, not emotion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THORPE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  As a graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, one of the highest governance training organisations in this country, I learnt a lot about accountability and transparency. Coming out of that training and coming into this place, I see a very real lack of accountability and transparency, which is the very essence of how you govern an organisation, a corporation and—I thought—a country. Obviously that isn't the case, and maybe they should include in that training that, when you get to the place of governing the country, accountability and transparency just does not apply, particularly to this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To hear the government's contribution and excuses as to why they can't be accountable and transparent to the people of this country is an absolute joke. To hear the government talk about science and sustainable practices while there are black senators in this place who come from over 65,000 years of sustainable practices in this country is also an absolute insult. You want to think about whether or not to stand for the acknowledgement of country the next time we sit because, if you can't acknowledge the over 65,000 years of sustainable practices and our survival as First Peoples in this country then you should sit down for the acknowledgement. An acknowledgement of country is about obeying the law of this land. The law of this land is about not harming the land, not harming the water, and not harming the animals and everything that belongs to these lands. So sit down to the acknowledgement to country. And, of course, take down your dot paintings, because I'm sure you've got some animals and totems in your dot paintings that are in danger of becoming extinct right now. So, while you have your hand on your heart and you're standing up to acknowledge us, you're actually stabbing us in the back and murdering our totems and our land and our water in the same breath.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You talk about 'commodity' and the land and water being 'your commodity'—stolen land, stolen water and stolen wealth from our commodity. We don't see it in the same way. The land is our mother. The way we look at our land and our water is the same way we look at our mother. If you can sell your mother as a commodity, then you're gross. It's disgusting that you could sell off your own mother and treat your own mother the way you treat our mother in this country—raping and pillaging our mother. I ask you: would you do that to your own mother? Look at it through the eyes of the First Peoples of this country and understand the hurt and pain you're causing our water, our land, our air and our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those reports that you refuse to acknowledge or answer to are part of the solution to healing these lands and these waters. I know you're not interested in that. I know Labor aren't really interested either—or only when it suits them. But we know your position on protecting country, and you treat us like a bunch of greenie activists when the greenie activists, or the Greens Party, are in step and absolutely respect the first people of this country. So, if anyone is guiding the Greens Party on how to care for this country, it's the first people of these lands. So don't refer to us as some breakout party that causes you grief because you're doing the wrong thing with your mates over here: Labor. Look at us in a way that you can stand for the acknowledgement of country, because you need to have a bit more respect and you need to account for the destruction and desecration that you are causing and creating for our future generations. You've been doing it since you arrived on your boats. Since you arrived on your boats illegally to this country, the colonisers, who only see our land and water as a commodity to destroy and make money from so that you're comfortable in your privilege, and your mates, who are giving you the money who run all of these outfits to destroy and destruct, all sit back with your privilege. You know what? Your children and your grandchildren are going to look at you in 10 or 20 years time and they're going to say: 'What did you do? What did you do for us?' What are you going to say to them? I want to know what you're going to say to your grandchildren when they don't have clean water to drink, when they have to stay inside because the heat is so unbearable that people are dropping like flies. What are you going to say to your children and grandchildren? What are you going to say to the young people of this country who are out there fighting for their lives, trying to tell Labor and you, the Libs and Nats, that you need to do more to sustain our future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want clean air. We want clean water. We don't need fossil fuels. We don't need the destruction and desecration of country and water. There are other ways to do this. Do you think all those young people marching for climate change and climate action are going to take up one of your jobs in your departments to destroy and destruct? No. No. They're going to be looking after your children and your grandchildren. They're the ones putting their arms around your grandchildren and saying: 'Come with us. We just have to try and survive for another couple of years before the wave comes or the heatwave comes or the dirty water comes'—which we know is already happening. We know communities don't have clean water because of the decisions that are made in this place. We know that you're stealing land off traditional owners to destroy and destruct. What does that say for our future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you want left? What? Really? Because you've had free run to destroy and destruct, and you've made a lot of money out of it. What are you going to leave us? What are you going to leave the First Peoples of these lands? What are you going to leave the children and young people of this country? You're going to leave them in an absolute mess, an absolute dire mess, where they'll be gasping for their air, where they'll be desperate for clean water. Wake up! Why can't you see this? It's happening now, and you can't even provide any feedback about the importance of protecting country. Why can't you protect country with us? Why can't we protect country together for all Australians? Why is it such a big ask?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do these fossil fuel companies and companies that are set up to destruct and destroy have precedence, because money won't matter when we are fighting for our life? Your status won't matter when we're fighting for our life. COVID shows that. Rich, poor—it affects everybody. You will be affected. What are you doing for your children, I ask. We are fighting every last breath to maintain the survival of our young people in this country and our old people, because our old people drop from the heat. What are you going to say to that? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  I must say Senator Duniam obviously missed a memo of the Labor-Greens scare campaign with his performance before—on a unity ticket with Senator Urquhart and supporting the Tasmanian fishing industry, as plenty of other senators do in this place. I'm sure he'll get a rap over the knuckles for that. I wasn't really going to come in and contribute to this debate—until I saw the performance of Minister Birmingham before. It was, as Senator Hanson-Young said, a disrespectful and arrogant performance. You can understand that he's probably not in a good mood this morning; the government haven't had the best of weeks. But it's not as though he's been busy passing legislation. I don't know what else he has been up to this week if they couldn't respond to these important 18 reports of the Senate committee. I have had the misfortune of being on the Senate committee with Senator Whish-Wilson on and off over the last couple of years as well and I recently just came back onto it. I was astonished to see that there were still so many reports outstanding that the government have not responded to. It really is astounding that they have been so derelict in their duty that they haven't responded to some of these important reports. I will come back to this later. You might think, 'Oh well, these are just Senate committee reports,' but they do touch on really important issues and they have real life consequences for people. I had an experience of that recently—and I will come to that later—on the road trip I did through North Queensland and Central Queensland with the federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community take these Senate reports very seriously. Anyone who has been involved in these committees knows that the experts and the Australian people who participate, who have lived experience and turn up and give evidence, take this very seriously. They think it's important that they get the opportunity to express their ideas, their experience or their knowledge so that the senators can take that and put it into their report. And I think we've seen from the debate on this today that there often is contestability—Labor and the Greens will disagree or Labor and the government will disagree. That's exactly what you want when you're preparing these reports; you want some contestability. But it's also why you want the government to respond. They are actually looking at the evidence that has been gathered from experts and from those with lived experience so they can use it, implement it and turn it into policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to the arrogance of this government and it also goes to the lack of accountability of this government—the fact that we're having this debate this morning, in the same week they have announced that they are going to junk, and not actually pursue, a federal integrity commission. It is no surprise when you look at the way they treat Senate committees, when you look at the way they treat the Senate, when you look at the way they treat accountability and integrity issues. This government always looks the other way. And they do it in so many areas. It's quite remarkable when you think about it: they haven't responded to 18 important Senate committee reports from environment and comms but they took half an hour in a meeting, with no due diligence, to give almost half a billion dollars to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. They can go and do that with half a billion dollars, with no notice, with no due diligence, yet they can't respond to these important reports despite some of them having existed for more than seven years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the real-life consequences of this and some of the reports that I've been involved with. If you look at the retirement of coal-fired power stations, what triggered that was the closure of Hazelwood—something that had a significant impact on regional Victorian communities and something the government has not responded to. You'd think there would be something in it they could learn, something in it they would be able to better respond to, yet there has been no response from the government on this important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other report that I had some recent experience of is in relation to the impact of feral deer, pigs and goats in Australia. This is something I had some involvement with when it was before the committee. On that road trip I did with the federal Labor leader early in January, we stopped at a banana farm near Tully that was run by Stephen Lowe. For those who don't know, Panama disease has had a significant impact on the banana industry in North Queensland. Stephen, the owner of that farm, was talking to us because he is so concerned that the Panama disease is only one farm away from his. And one of the things that is transporting the Panama disease across farms is feral pigs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might think, 'What's the real-life consequence?' Well, this is someone who has put his life into building this farm. He knows that feral pigs are causing the problem of spreading Panama disease across farms in North Queensland, yet this Liberal-National government can't find the time to respond to such an important issue in Far North Queensland. So here's a farmer—he employs plenty of people; he provides good support to the local community—who's doing the right thing by his farm and trying to build a long-term operation in North Queensland. He knows the risk of Panama disease from feral pigs. These are issues that were tackled in this Senate report, yet the government—the Liberal-National parties, who are supposed to look after farmers—can't take the time to respond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about these reports you might think: 'They're abstract. They don't really contain real-life experience.' But they do for this farmer near Tully. They do for these banana growers, who know that government action to stop feral pigs spreading Panama disease is going to be the difference between them keeping their livelihoods or falling by the wayside. Senate reports are not just glory exercises by senators; they have a real impact on real people with real livelihoods, and on communities. Banana farming in North Queensland is a significant industry. It employs hundreds of people. It is something that the government need to turn their attention to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are just a couple of examples about the real-life consequences of the government not responding to these reports and not adequately addressing these issues. It means people's livelihoods and communities are at risk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion goes to the accountability and transparency of the government. And the way they have come here today and treated the response to senators raising this important issue goes to the arrogance of the government. We see it more and more. It is really troubling that there are so many reports outstanding. There are so many issues on which the government's integrity and accountability can be called into question, yet they continue to run, continue to hide. It is absolutely disgusting that this week they said they would be abandoning a federal integrity commission.</span>

They're sick and tired of the arrogance. Today we've again seen examples of an arrogant government, an arrogant minister and an arrogant performance, when they really have nothing to be arrogant about.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  Mr President, I find myself here again under order of the Senate—an order of the Senate that is highly politically motivated in terms of the relentless politicisation of matters in relation to aged care and the relentless politicisation of delicate matters in relation to COVID-19. The approach that is being taken by those opposite seems to put the reality of COVID-19, of the omicron variant and the many challenges and infectiousness that it results in, to one side just in pursuit of political points; in particular, in pursuit of political points against the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reject the basis upon which this motion has been made and the many accusations that have been made and, indeed, will be made, I'm sure, in the debate that will ensue. I want to state very, very clearly the support for Minister Colbeck and the work that he does—has done, continues to do and will continue to do—across the government. The support, though, is not just for Minister Colbeck, because it is not about him; it's about a team of health experts and aged-care experts across different government agencies that he works closely with. It's about all those different officials and employees across the Australian Public Service who have been working with him, with the government and with Minister Hunt to make sure they do everything possible from a Commonwealth level in support of the people who it is really about—that is, aged-care workers, aged-care residents and those people on the front line of aged care in perhaps the most difficult time that aged-care facilities around the world have faced. In terms of modern aged-care facilities, I think we can say with a high degree of confidence that none in any country have faced situations like those which COVID-19 has brought to them in the last couple of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure we will see slurs and attacks made on Minister Colbeck about his attendance at the cricket. I want to make it very clear that Minister Colbeck, as those in this chamber know, isn't just the minister for aged-care services; he is also the Minister for Sport and the senior government senator from Tasmania. All of you know the circumstances of the different responsibilities he has within those different roles. However, even with that, I know he continues to give enormous priority and precedence to the work he has to do as the minister for aged-care services because of the global challenges and, with how they materialise in Australia, the local challenges that the aged-care sector faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 14 January, when some will allege that Minister Colbeck was not at his job, Minister Colbeck was hard at it participating in many different aspects of the aged-care response. Those included: the COVID vaccine and response meeting, led by task force commander Lieutenant General John Frewen; a meeting with the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner and with the acting secretary of the Department of Health on a range of different aged-care matters, including the status of outbreaks across the aged-care sector at that stage; and a meeting with the Deputy Chief Medical Officer to discuss aged-care advisory group actions and to work through all those different issues. They are just some of the things in relation to the work in the aged-care services portfolio that Minister Colbeck undertook that day, as he does every day in terms of working through these issues, with his engagement with all those senior officials and with the sector in addressing the challenges of COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Colbeck has also made himself very available—I'm sure this will come up as well—to the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19, appearing on multiple occasions before that committee as well as the times he has appeared before Senate estimates committees and the endless questions he continues to face in this chamber about important issues as they relate to aged care. They are important issues. Nobody denies the fact that the challenges in aged care are real; as I said before, they are real not just in Australia but right around the world. Tragically, there is a loss of life around the world and in Australia, and in aged-care facilities in Australia, as a result of COVID. But, of course, in those aged-care facilities across the country there is also a sad and tragic loss of life every day due to a range of factors for the individuals at end-of-life that workers are caring for and supporting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to supporting aged care has been to focus on vaccines where it can. Every single aged-care facility has had the opportunity for its residents to have not just a first dose, not just a second dose, but a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. As is known, the one area that the government led, in urging for and supporting a mandate in relation to vaccines, was aged care, in working with the states and territories to see them enact those requirements across the board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the government, under the leadership of Ministers Colbeck and Hunt, have sought to provide significant support to the aged-care sector—more than $2½ billion worth of investment and support to the aged-care sector, with more than $1½ billion of that $2½ billion of additional support being made available to support the aged-care workforce in particular. We recognise the challenges of the workforce that have been exacerbated by the wide spread of the omicron variant and the associated isolation requirements that have ensued. That has required us to trigger the various availabilities for surge workforce assistance across the country. As at 4 February, more than 80,000 shifts have been filled by workforce surge staff supporting the aged-care sector. As I understand it, there are around 852 current deployments of surge staff and support at active outbreak sites across residential aged-care facilities. A range of different providers are supporting that operation, including the Australian Defence Force, with the capabilities they have to hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The type of work they do is supported by the significant volumes of personal protective equipment and other equipment that we've made available to support aged care throughout the pandemic. We've seen tens of millions of masks, gowns, gloves, goggles and face shields, hundreds of thousands of bottles of hand sanitiser and millions of rapid antigen tests dispatched to aged-care facilities to help meet the unique needs and challenges they face. None of these things make it easy in aged-care facilities because COVID-19 cannot be easy for the management of those facilities. Our thoughts go in particular to the workforce who we've supported not just in providing the surge capacity and additional staff capacity but also through bonus and retention payments that have been made during the course of the pandemic. Four separate workforce bonus payments were made to aged-care workers, recognising the additional stressors that have been placed upon them. These temporary actions we've taken in response to COVID-19 in the aged-care sector are in addition to the fundamental reforms that we are pursuing in the response to the aged-care royal commission that Minister Colbeck, together with Minister Hunt, has been leading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last year's budget, and in further midyear budget updates, more than $18 billion has been committed and is being delivered through the aged-care sector to support comprehensive areas of reform recommended by the royal commission. Additional home-care places, additional arrangements in relation to minimum staff and additional safety requirements are all different areas that Minister Colbeck is well versed to speak on and to detail. The government's response has been comprehensive. The government have been clear in what we are doing, how we are going about it and what funds are provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition seek to be critics, but they've offered no alternative in relation to the responses to the aged-care sector but for one that I suspect we will see again in this debate as they trot it out as part of their attacks on Minister Colbeck and the government—that is, that they will make a submission for aged-care workers to receive a higher wage outcome from the process before the independent umpire at the Fair Work Commission. The government support the Fair Work Commission process. We support the decisions, whatever they may be, of the independent umpire, and we have provided information to it. Those opposite, though, want to have their cake and eat it too on that debate. They say there should be an increase, but they don't have the guts to actually say what it should be. They won't say whether it should be a cent or a dollar or $100 or $1,000. They won't put any figure on it. It is a hollow promise they're making, and of course the reason that they won't put any dollars on it is that they don't want to have to account for it. What trust, what faith can aged-care workers have in relation to those opposite if they run around saying: 'We think there should be an increase; we would make a submission, but we won't actually say what we would put in that submission and we are not going to budget a single cent to actually deliver it'? What confidence can they have that it is nothing other than a cheap political stunt by those opposite to seek to take advantage of a sector that is stressed, that is challenged, that is facing a global challenge and crisis the likes of which they have never confronted before and their counterparts around the world have never confronted before?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we have managed, notwithstanding the enormous challenges of this, to keep COVID-19 at bay in the main whilst vaccinations were developed and the vaccination program rolled out. During that time we have seen an improvement in the sense that, whilst the omicron variant may be much more infectious, it also results in around 70 per cent less severe health outcomes. What we've successfully done as a country through our closed border and through other measures that we, the states and territories, industry and others have achieved is buy time to get the vaccinations developed, initially around the world, and to have a more resilient environment in aged care today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no doubt that we will hear plenty of politicking to come from those opposite, plenty of sniping at Minister Colbeck that will be unfair and personalised and seek to continue to paint a picture of an aged-care sector not supported by the government or the officials hard at work in actually delivering support on the ground. The picture those opposite paint is not an accurate one, and it is certainly not one that actually reflects and understands the complexities in the aged-care sector, the complexities in dealing with COVID-19. It pretends that somehow there are alternate universes in which COVID can be locked in a box and in which omicron is not actually as transmissible as it is. That's just not true. There are real challenges that we all have to deal with. What we have sought to do is provide as much support as possible in a very challenging environment, and I know that Minister Colbeck will continue to do that with the greatest of diligence and effort to the task at hand.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for providing that speech this morning. Despite what Senator Birmingham said, the picture we paint is an accurate picture of what's happening in aged care at the moment. We have an aged-care system that is broken. We have an aged-care system that is in crisis. We have an aged-care system where it cannot be guaranteed at the moment that elderly people living in residential aged care are receiving the quality of care that they deserve. There are too many stories of neglect. There are too many stories of people who have lost loved ones—mums and dads and grandparents and, in some cases, younger people living in residential aged care—in terrible circumstances that will devastate those families and those individuals for years to come, if not forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't the fault of the staff who work in the aged-care sector. There are not enough of them. They don't get paid enough. You can't retain them because they can get better pay outside the sector. The providers support this view. It's not us sitting here politicking; this is the snapshot of aged care at the moment. I know the minister knows that, because he will be getting the same emails and the same correspondence that we are getting—awful stories of what is currently happening in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the government wants to say, 'Well, it's omicron' or 'Well, it's COVID.' While COVID has stressed the system, it's not the cause of the broken system we have. That has been years in the making. We've had 22 reports and a royal commission with an interim report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. We've had a Treasurer, now Prime Minister, who cut funding from aged care when we were in a world of 'a surplus at any cost', despite the fact that it was going to hurt elderly Australians. When we were living in that world and that political reality, that's what the Prime Minister did. Those cuts and those failures of years ago are coming back to roost now, and, yes, we do hold this minister responsible. Perhaps he's not responsible for all the failures of the system—that goes to his predecessors as well—but at some point somebody has to take responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can deal with the cricket again—I know this has become a talking point—the cricket is symbolic of a complacent government that has not worked during its nine years to fix a system. I don't care that Minister Colbeck went to the cricket. I wish I could have gone to the cricket that day. I like cricket. But the fact is we were told by Minister Colbeck that he did not want to see resources diverted from dealing with the crisis and therefore he could not attend the committee hearing. That is the problem—that we weren't told the truth. That smacks of complacency, arrogance and disrespect for the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From my point of view, the real issue is about what's happening for people living in aged care. We have the Defence Force currently working in there. Yes, there is an impact from COVID, but we have nearly 200,000 Australians, at their most vulnerable, living in a system where we cannot guarantee that they are going to be cared for properly. That is the failure of this minister and it is a failure of this government. As I said, it might not be fair to lay 100 per cent of the fault at Minister Colbeck's feet. Maybe 50 per cent of it should be with the Prime Minister. Maybe more should be with the Prime Minister, seeing as how he made all the cuts to aged care years ago. But, under our system, the minister takes responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">
                  </span>The system is in crisis. Hundreds of people are dying. Staff are leaving the sector in droves. The government doesn't have the answers and over the years hasn't made the investment that would have provided elderly Australians with the protection they deserve. It is a national shame that we accept the system as it is. It has to be better, and the minister has to be held to account.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  That was a very, very interesting contribution from Senator Gallagher. What we heard was a catalogue of criticisms without any solutions. What is the definition of politics in this place? What is the definition of politicking in this Senate chamber? That definition is coming into this place with your criticisms and not offering up a plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Labor—not offering up a plan today and not offering up a plan yesterday. When Bill Shorten went to the last election and asked for support from the Australian people, guess what he said about aged care? Guess what he said about the funding of aged care? You're right: nothing—nothing, nothing, nothing. Silence. Australians are right to ask: if Bill Shorten had been elected Prime Minister and this country had been confronted with a pandemic, what would aged-care funding look like? What would it look like? If you can't tell Australians, at an election, on the day you're giving your National Press Club speech, what aged-care funding will look like if you're elected then Australians cannot trust you. I'm very confident that aged care would be in a significantly different place if Labor had won the last election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Colbeck has stewarded this country in aged-care policy through significant landmark reforms. I say that as someone who, through the community affairs committee process, has watched very, very closely the contributions he has made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me identify one important contribution that Senator Gallagher and, I'm sure, other Labor senators choose to ignore. I would hope that, if Senator Siewert were still here, Senator Waters, she would draw attention to this very, very important and particular issue—that is, the work that Minister Colbeck has specifically done around strengthening regulations as they apply to physical and chemical constraints in aged-care homes. I hope that, if the Greens make a contribution and there's a future contribution by Labor, they will at least have the decency to recognise that this is a minister who has not only pursued reforms and fought to have them well funded at historically high levels. This is a minister who has been tackling other issues which are just as important in our aged-care system. Senator Waters, that's your challenge: I challenge you to at least recognise that, because Senator Siewert would have had the decency to do so. She would absolutely have had the decency to do that, because Senator Colbeck worked closely with Senator Siewert when she was in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just unacceptable for Labor to continue to come into this place, arguing for reforms for aged care and arguing for funding for aged-care workers, and not even offer up a solution or a figure. Even the newspapers were forced to report that Anthony Albanese, in making a pledge for aged care, made a loose commitment that he would fund aged care. Guess what he didn't do? He did not put a figure on it. Is he saying that the future forward estimates increases in aged-care funding are guaranteed, or are they not guaranteed? When Labor were in government previously, they did change aged-care funding and they dialled it down. Labor doesn't talk about that. It doesn't want to talk about that. But its record is appalling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher made a very good point: these issues are complex. There's a matrix of issues. But guess where the devastation happened the most for families of people in aged care? In the state of Victoria. But, while drawing necessary attention to this, at least have the decency to identify that Premier Daniel Andrews's poor contact tracing, allowing community transmission in the community, led to all those aged-care deaths. If you don't believe me, go to the Senate estimates transcripts and look at what Commonwealth health officials had to say. These are the facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a minister who is diligent, who is committed, who is available and who has been pursuing reforms across the entire aged-care sector. The challenge is actually for Labor. As we approach the federal election, people will be interested to know what the alternative aged-care solution is. Thus far, Labor has said nothing and it's committed not one red cent. The challenge on aged care going forward is— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I rise this morning to speak to Senator Watt's motion and to ask the government to explain why Minister Colbeck remains the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services. The Minister for Aged Care has failed to keep older people safe, and the federal government is responsible for aged care. They have done a shocking job at keeping older people safe in this country. The minister for aged care has failed—and the word 'failed' has to be reiterated—on all accounts. He's failed on the vaccine rollout, failed to provide boosters to older Australians and their carers and failed to provide PPE. Aged-care workers still have to pay for their own rapid antigen tests. This is simply unacceptable. Older people in residential aged care are missing out on basic care and hygiene due to the workforce shortages and, of course, the COVID crisis. Our older people are locked down and isolated from family and friends because of this government's failure to protect them. Where's the minister's accountability? It's missing in action, as usual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, in my home state of WA, we recorded our first two cases of omicron in an aged-care facility. These cases were detected in a residential aged-care facility in Bentley. I'm extremely worried about the threat of COVID in aged-care facilities, particularly in WA, as we open our border. We should be learning the lessons from the COVID crisis here on the east coast and doing everything we can to support aged-care services, particularly in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not new issues in the aged-care sector. These have been going on for decades, and the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety found that there were unacceptably high levels of abuse and neglect in aged care and in fact, with the intersection of disability, anyone that is over 65 years of age is in aged care. The system was in crisis before COVID arrived. That needs to be acknowledged, and thanks to a decade of funding cuts by successive governments this is the place that we find ourselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The care economy is one of our largest workforces. The aged-care workers in this country are underpaid and overworked. They are some of the lowest paid people in the country and they have been working tirelessly throughout this pandemic to support older people in our communities. They absolutely deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission recommended that the government in this sector put in applications to the Fair Work Commission to increase their wages. The latest federal budget included no ongoing wage increase for these workers. The one-off payment that the Morrison government announced recently is just not enough. It's not enough when this is our largest workforce in this country. Without serious long-term commitments to improve pay, conditions and training, this government will be unable to implement the recommendations from the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the major parties, the Greens are strongly backing the calls from the unions for permanent wage increases for aged-care workers, and the Greens are the only party arguing that aged care should not be run for profit. Big corporations should not be making millions of dollars for the provision of essential social services—I want to note, that was the work that Senator Rachel Siewert had done so tirelessly in this sector. And for-profit companies have got away with substandard care for too long, which is why we are now at crisis point in this global pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the folks out there who are watching, we are having an election very soon. By voting Greens in this election we have a chance to kick out this government, the one that has caused this situation and exacerbated this situation. Your vote is powerful, so, together, we can kick them out and we can ensure that everyone in this country has access to high-quality aged-care services.</span>

This is a difficult portfolio, and that difficulty has been exacerbated by COVID-19. As has been acknowledged through the debate, I came to the portfolio with a royal commission which exposed a whole range of issues that needed to be addressed in aged care. That is my commitment: to address those issues in aged care. It's been made all the more difficult by the circumstances of COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just quickly like to address a couple of things. There's been a lot of comment made about the booster rollout. The booster rollout is well ahead of what it was originally programmed to do. While Labor were having their holidays over Christmas, we received advice on Christmas Eve that the period between second and third shots should be brought forward. This government, over Christmas, while Labor was on holidays, worked to bring forward the booster shots for residential aged-care facilities in this country, and they have all now been achieved. Every facility in the country has been visited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the things that keep me and my departmental officials awake at night to make sure we do everything we possibly can in support of residents in residential aged care. I've had the opportunity to work in facilities as a contractor before coming to this place. I've seen the way that the industry has changed, but I also understand that there is further reform required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has put in place the most comprehensive response in history to any royal commission: $17.7 billion; a five-pillar five-year reform program for this industry. That $17.7 billion post MYEFO is now in excess of $18 billion. This government's commitment cannot be questioned, and the criticism from the other side would actually mean something if they had a plan. They have no plan. They have no response to the royal commission almost a year since it was handed down.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is critical. I will speak first to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cyclone and Flood Damage Reinsurance Pool) Bill 2022. This bill, in effect, creates a system where the government becomes an insurer of last resort. It will only apply to a relatively small geographic part of the country. The reason the government has to do this—or wants to do this—is because insurance companies are vacating the field. The reason insurance companies are vacating the field is because of climate change. What we are facing is a climate that is breaking down around us. Governments are going to have to come to grips with this, because, more and more, we will see insurance companies—driven by the massive, global, multinational, reinsurance companies—vacating the field. This will mean that ordinary Australians won't be able to get insurance on their homes, their properties and their businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This shouldn't just be limited to one small part of the country; this is a valid and growing area of concern around the whole country. It's only going to get worse. So it's critical that this bill be referred to an inquiry so that Australians from right around the country who will not benefit from this bill can have their voices heard and Australians who are extremely worried about the lack of climate action and climate ambition with both major parties in this place can make those views heard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What needs to happen on this bill, ultimately, is that we should be putting a levy on the companies that massively profit from burning fossil fuels, logging our native forests and producing massive carbon emissions as a result. We should be levying them to pay for schemes like this. That's why this needs to go to an inquiry, and that's why the Greens have moved this amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time left to me, I will quickly indicate why we believe that the Social Media (Anti-Trolling) Bill 2022 needs to go to an inquiry. Of course something needs to be done to address some of the online harms that are caused by trolls. This bill does not do that. This is actually not an antitrolling bill, as is claimed in the title. What we've seen from this government is the continued erosion of rights, freedoms and liberties over the last couple of decades. This bill is yet another step on that dangerous path down the road to a surveillance state and a police state. On that basis, if on no other basis, this bill should be referred to an inquiry so people can have a say about that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment pertains to removing the three latest electoral bills from being rammed through this chamber, because we would like to refer those three electoral bills to a committee for scrutiny in the ordinary manner of all legislation, because no-one should be passing legislation that they haven't even seen until 24 hours ago. So this amendment refers each of these three electoral bills—one about COVID enfranchisement, one about authorisations and one about foreign influences—to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry by 25 March. This is a fairly tight inquiry time frame as it is, but—people are looking at me strangely.</span>

                    </a>  I'm sure our chamber attendants will do their very best to circulate it. The effect of the amendment is to refer those three electoral bills to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for an inquiry by 25 March. That will be with you on a piece of paper shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that we need these bills to be properly inquired into is that no-one should pass laws that they've only just seen in draft form 24 hours ago, particularly laws that relate to people's ability to vote and choose the government of the day. Some of these bills sound innocuous. Maybe they are, but we will never know unless we have time to scrutinise them and hear from experts and potentially find loopholes or nefarious consequences that the Senate might then seek to amend, close and change. That's the whole point of an inquiry, so it's kind of ironic that we need to argue for basic process here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just point out that these three bills follow 10 electoral bills that we've seen in five months, so we have had a flurry of attempts by the government to change very fundamental rules about voting and elections in the shadow of an election that they are desperate to attempt to win, because they are so deeply unpopular throughout the entire community—in particular the Prime Minister. This is not the way to win an election—trying to rig the system at the last minute and ram through bills that suit your own purposes. It's pretty shameless, folks, even for you. So we'd like these bills to be inquired into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might add that the last time we dealt with electoral legislation this government was proposing to bring in the requirement that voters show identification before they voted and then to set up a convoluted, impractical process in the event that someone couldn't provide identification. It was a pure attempt to disenfranchise people. It would have had the effect of disenfranchising First Nations people, people without a home and women fleeing from violence. These are people who might not have their ID papers with them. They might not have ID papers at all and they might not have a person who can come along to the polling booth and vouch for them, so that they can get a declaration vote. It was a shameless way of trying to deflate the vote of people who traditionally don't vote for the Liberal Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A deal was done between the two big parties. In the course of dealing with that bill, the government were also trying to silence the genuine involvement and advocacy of not-for-profit organisations in the contest of ideas that is an election campaign. They were trying to bring an additional layer of bureaucracy to non-government organisations which advocate for their purposes—sometimes, charitable purposes—and which are already covered by a schema that heavily regulates charities. The government were essentially seeking to silence dissent and silence voices that call out their terrible policies. In the course of dealing with that bill, the two big parties did a deal together, as they so frequently do, and pushed off voter ID laws. Yesterday in this chamber we saw Senator McGrath introduce his own voter ID bill, so this issue is not dead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is once again trying to rig the electoral system to benefit themselves, because they've got nothing left. They've got no policies that anybody likes. They don't have any representatives that anyone likes much anymore, if the latest polls are anything to go by. And now they're trying to ram through three more electoral bills which may have consequences that this chamber isn't across without having an inquiry to find out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are moving for these three electoral bills to go to an inquiry, as they normally would, in the usual manner. It's particularly important when bills are about voting and the right of people to have their say about who runs this country and protects their future or sells it out to big corporations and political donors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are two bits of legislation. It is standard practice for legislation to be sent to a committee for inquiry. It's a really basic part of our job as the Senate—to inquire into bills. It is not acceptable that this legislation is being introduced and not being sent off to a committee for inquiry. By referring these bills for inquiry, we're basically just asking the Senate to do its job so that we have transparency on two bits of really important legislation that are going to affect people's lives—in particular the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Workforce Incentive) Bill 2022, which is in the space of income support and workforce incentives. There is a nexus between supporting people who are seeking employment, supporting people who need to be supported by government with income support and the actions that the government can take to support people to move into employment. It is a very complex space and it's one where we know the government is doing very badly at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have people living on income support who cannot find work, who are living in poverty, who are living well below the poverty line and who cannot afford to put food on the table. We've got people who should be on the disability support pension who can't get on the disability support pension—because maybe they will recover from their brain cancer!—who are then on JobSeeker. We've got other people who should be on the disability support pension who are on JobSeeker who are being forced to comply with so-called mutual obligations. Even in COVID we have got people being forced to go and have face-to-face meetings with their employment services provider; they are being told, 'No, you can't have these meetings over the phone or via videoconferencing; you've got to come in, in person.' We have so many people jumping through hoops which are supposedly meant to help them find work. They feel they are being asked to do so many things which are not helping them find work; it is all just a matter of them having to do crazy things and apply for jobs they know they haven't got a hope of getting and they haven't got the skills to do, but their employment service provider is telling them they've got to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the sorts of things that this bill is in the middle of. We need to get our employment incentives right, with what really works to get people into employment. We need to make sure that people who, for whatever reason, are not able to work get the support they need. We need to at least double the current rate of JobSeeker from the pitiful $43 a day that it is at the moment. The Greens' position is that we need to double it to at least $80 a day so that people are not left living in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that everybody in Australia has support and that government can support them so that they can live a decent life, not be in a situation which so many people across Australia are in today—of not being able to afford to put food on the table, only being able to afford to eat one meal a day, their kids not being able to have shoes on their feet, kids not being able to go on school excursions and people being homeless because they can't afford skyrocketing rents. This is the reality for far too many people in Australia. Yet we have this government saying, 'We'll just invent some other useless workplace incentive and workforce incentive to try and get them into work.' But people know that they need to be lifted out of poverty and be supported to help get their lives in a good place, to help them get the education they need, to help them get a roof over their heads and to help them afford to eat healthy food. These are the sorts of basic measures that will allow people to really live their life to the fullest, to genuinely participate in the workforce. These are the sorts of fundamental measures that need to be inquired into. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We intend to vote differently on the following pieces of legislation: the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Foreign Influences and Offences) Bill, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Authorisations) Bill and the Electoral Legislation Amendment (COVID Franchisement) Bill, the NDIS amendment, the Religious Discrimination Bill, the Religious Discrimination (Consequential Amendments) Bill and the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2021.

                  </a>  The Religious Discrimination Bill should be dumped rather than be rushed through the Senate. The bill, as was passed through the House last night, would increase discrimination against people with disability, against women, against people of minority faiths and against LGBTIQA+ people. The bill, as was passed through the House last night, would allow an aged-care home to refuse to employ a worker because she is a Muslim woman wearing a hijab. The bill, as was passed through the House last night, would allow a school to sack staff or students because they refuse to sign up to a school policy that says homosexuality is evil. The bill that was passed through the House last night would make legal hurtful, harmful statements, like disability being a punishment from God. This bill should be dumped. It should be put into the dustbin of history, rather than being rushed through the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I rise to speak to the Parliamentary Workplace Reform (Set the Standard Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. The Greens will be supporting this bill as it is a tiny step in the right direction by implementing two recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard</span> report. There's still so much more to do, but this is a start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will prevent staff from being arbitrarily fired for no reason other than that they've become a political problem for their employer. We know the sweeping powers for parliamentarians to fire staff have caused significant barriers for staff coming forward, fearing that their job, not the job of their abuser or harasser, would be at risk. We know that the change made by this bill alone will not change the culture of shaming and silencing that stops staff coming forward. That cultural shift requires full implementation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard</span> recommendations—a robust, independent and well-resourced complaint process; trauma-informed training for parliamentarians and senior staff; a code of conduct with meaningful options to sanction abusers and those who facilitate or ignore abuse; and genuine work for a more inclusive and representative parliament and parliamentary workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes clear that all parliamentarians have obligations under the Work Health and Safety Act to provide a safe workplace. We welcome that, but the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report couldn't have been clearer that these obligations are not enough to protect staff against harassment, bullying and assault. What is needed in this workplace—and in all others around the country—is a positive duty on employers to ensure that staff are safe, where there's a zero tolerance policy in action, not just words, and where appropriate support is available. A positive duty was the foundation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> recommendations for making workplaces safe, and without that duty all other reforms are built on very shaky ground. The government voted against amendments moved by Senator McAllister and me last year to introduce a positive duty and, despite vague assurances that they're working on it, we're yet to see progress on it, and I have no confidence that Australian workers will also get protection from the government before the election. We will continue to push for a positive duty so that every worker in every workplace can feel safe and be respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing that this bill does is to ensure the MOP(S) Act staff are covered by the Age Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act. This is an important reminder that the abuse detailed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard</span> report was extensive. The attention has been on sexual harassment and assault, but we must not ignore the reports of racism, ablism, ageism and classism in this case. People of colour, people with disability and older women have all reported that their harassment was compounded by discrimination and that they were targeted more, believed and supported less and too often driven from this workplace. I cannot look around the room and pretend that we don't have a representation problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the faces of Rachelle Miller, Chelsey Potter, Brittany Higgins, Josie Coles, Saxon Mullins, Chanel Contos and Grace Tame; we know these courageous women not because they're the only ones who have been abused, not because they're the only ones who've come forward but because they look most like the people that we know, that we can identify with. This does not diminish in any way the significance of their experience or the importance of them coming forward. The fact that these women came forward is a key reason that we're even having this discussion today. But, as each of these women has themselves acknowledged, as Brittany Higgins and Grace Tame said in their phenomenal address yesterday, as Amy Remeikis has said so eloquently so many times, 'So many survivors are missing from the public conversation because they don't look like me.' This has to change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to share a story that should remind us all why this legislation and immediate action to implement the recommendations of <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard </span>in full are needed A New South Wales parliamentary staffer assaulted his colleague, Dhanya Mani, in 2015. The assault happened after many months of harassment, which she'd reported to her supervisors. She had been repeatedly told that she was overreacting, that he just had a bit of a crush and that maybe she should just go out with him. Then he violently assaulted her. For reasons familiar to so many survivors, particularly women of colour, she didn't make a police report, fearing she would not be believed, that her name would be made public, that it would affect her job and reputation, that only she would suffer the consequences and that the justice system would not deliver her justice. Instead she made complaints through her work and her political party. She was largely ignored, placated and passed on. Meanwhile, her abuser continued to work in a senior role in the party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dhanya Mani and Chelsey Potter told their stories to the media in July 2019. They founded a non-partisan movement for survivors called 'Changing our Headline', which was later renamed 'Kate's List' in honour of the woman who alleges Christian Porter raped her. Through that movement, they heard story after story from women working in state and federal politics about abuse and harassment and the lack of support when they reported that abuse. In 2019, Dhanya phoned the Prime Minister's office. She explained that, through Kate's List, she had received many complaints from women in federal parliament, including in the Liberal Party, who had been harassed and abused. Each of those women had confided in a senior person with power to resolve their complaint or they had followed formal complaint mechanisms. None of the women felt that they had really been heard or that there had been consequences for their abusers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dhanya contacted the Prime Minister seeking two things. Firstly, she sought support to elevate a resolution of her own complaints after they had stalled in the New South Wales Liberal Party and the New South Wales Premier's office. Secondly, she sought a meeting to discuss the complaints from women working in the federal Liberal Party and what the PM and the party could do to avoid any other staffers suffering as Dhanya, Chelsey and all those who'd shared their stories had suffered. She was raising concerns on behalf of current and former political staff from all major political parties in Australia. She was reaching out to the Prime Minister and trying to offer constructive advice about how to lift the standards within his own party. She was sharing her own trauma to help prevent others from having to experience it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The response was telling. The Prime Minister's private secretary, Yaron Finkelstein, contacted her and suggested it was not a matter for the Prime Minister. He maintained that the existing processes were working well. He refused to facilitate a meeting with the Prime Minister, instead suggesting that she write his office a letter. He obfuscated. He declined to provide an email address. He said that he would call back the next day. She never heard back. Dhanya spoke with <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> in late February 2021 about her experience in trying to raise issues with the Prime Minister's office. The PMO denied that Dhanya had mentioned complaints in federal parliament to Mr Finkelstein. I have listened to a recording of that conversation, and I heard Dhanya repeatedly and categorically talk about these complaints and her hope to meet with the Prime Minister to discuss them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is more of the 'don't ask, don't tell' approach that we've heard so much of in this parliament: pretend it isn't happening, and gaslight and belittle those who come forward and background against them if you have to. That wilful disregard for survivors is why a toxic culture has persisted in this place for so long. They all knew it was happening. They just didn't care enough to make it stop. Dhanya wrote to the Prime Minister in February 2021, in the week following Brittany Higgins bravely coming forward. She wrote again to seek a meeting to discuss complaints that she'd received and recommendations for reform. She didn't hear back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dhanya wrote again to the Prime Minister in April 2021. She said in her letter: 'I detailed to you my own personal experiences of sexual misconduct. I explained the steps I took to seek justice and assistance. I explained that I had approached your senior aide Yaron Finkelstein for help. I summarised two years of research, advocacy and work on behalf of survivors of sexual crime, harassment, abuse, bullying and other serious misconduct in parliament and in Australia's workplaces more broadly. I took the time to write to you because I'm passionate about creating change and will never stop fighting for survivors. I requested a response from you. I have not received any acknowledgement from your office. This is unacceptable.' Dhanya didn't receive a response to that letter either. She was not invited to attend the statement of acknowledgment on Tuesday. Dhanya's experience is a stark reminder of the damage that a toxic, misogynistic culture that disregards harassment and abuse can cause. It shows how futile the efforts to bring concerns to those in power have been for so long. They knew. They didn't care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, we are now starting to see action. This is because of the strength of women like Dhanya Mani, Tessa Sullivan, Chelsey Potter, Rachelle Miller, Brittany Higgins, Grace Tame and so many others, and it's despite the barriers that powerful men have tried to put in their way. Dhanya has asked for me to share a message with you about what she hopes you took away from her story today: 'Earlier this week, there was an apology delivered by Scott Morrison to survivors of sexual abuse in politics. He spoke about the power of apologies to create reform and change. That statement is true; it just does not apply to his offensive and whitewashed excuse for an apology. Scott Morrison not only failed to genuinely consult or consider survivors in the wording of his apology; he rewrote and whitewashed Australian feminist history in the process. Tessa Sullivan, a woman of colour, who was the first to tell her story of sexual violence in politics when the Me Too Movement began to gain ground in Australia in early 2018, inspired me to speak out. Yet many Australians fail to recognise we would not be here without her. I continued Tessa's work, launching my campaign Kate's List when I told my story. My campaign was, and remains, designed to support survivors and end sexual violence in Australian politics and workplaces. Yet women like myself and Tessa are largely erased from media commentary, culture and history. Even now, in 2022, after the lessons of #MeToo, politicians and the mainstream media almost solely centre the stories of cisgender, able-bodied and conventionally attractive white women at the expense of all other voices. But this cultural moment of reckoning in Australian politics and feminism is built on the sacrifice, advocacy and unpaid labour of women of colour like me, like Tessa. We came first. Failing to acknowledge the labour of culturally and linguistically diverse women sends a message: sexual violence and other forms of abuse only impact white women. But we know that these crimes disproportionately impact CALD and First Nations women. In a country where colonisation is ongoing, we cannot allow this distorted and incomplete picture to form the sole foundation for the Australian public's understanding of male violence against women. If this parliament fails to act, it is tacitly endorsing and aggravating impenetrable barriers to equality for diverse, minority, identifying Australians. This country cannot achieve inclusive healthy progress for women in political life until and unless we start recognising and validating the vital work of women of colour and First Nations women in making opportunities for feminist cultural reckoning and reform possible. This speech is for all minority women, and women of colour, who do not feel seen in political life. I will keep fighting for us. I deserve to be seen. Tessa deserves to be seen. You deserve to be seen. This historic moment belongs to us, too. I will not stop until skin colour and minority status do not determine whether we are acknowledged, whether we are recognised by politicians in the media and whether cultural and historic milestones build on our advocacy and labour belong to us.' Those were the words of Dhanya Mani, which she wanted you all to hear. I'm honoured to be able to say them in this chamber, albeit belatedly, many years after her assault that was so mishandled by the political party that she belonged to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to this bill: it is a step in the right direction, but it is a tiny one. It finally does some of the things that Dhanya and others have been asking the government to do for years. The Greens will work to ensure that this parliament urgently takes the rest of the steps needed to turn things around properly and to make parliamentary workplaces—all workplaces—safe, equal, inclusive and respectful.</span>

The bill will progress important and significant reforms to help ensure that Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces are workplaces where expected standards of behaviour are modelled, championed and enforced, where respectful behaviour is standard, and in which any Australian, no matter their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, disability or age, feels safe and welcome to contribute.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would amend the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 to strengthen and clarify the employment rights of MOP(S) Act employees. The bill removes any doubt that the Fair Work Act 2009 applies to MOP(S) Act employees by making this explicit and would require parliamentarians to provide written reasons where they dismiss an employee from employment. These amendments result in additional information being provided to employees who are being terminated, which will result in an update to current arrangements and forms around the termination of employees, consistent with the recommendations of Commissioner Jenkins. Grounds around dismissal continue to include—very clearly specified—the restructure of an office which calls for a different set of employee skills; unsatisfactory performance or conduct by the employee; where a parliamentarian has lost trust or confidence in an employee; and where the employee has a significant conflict of interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would also amend the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 to clarify that parliamentarians are officers of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Work Health and Safety Act. The bill would also amend the Age Discrimination Act 2004 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 to put beyond doubt that MOP(S) Act employees have protection from age and disability discrimination, consistent with the recent amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have on a number of occasions indicated our support for Kate Jenkins's recommendations. We have worked with the opposition, other parties and Independents, and I acknowledge the work in this chamber of Senator Waters, Senator Gallagher, Senator Farrell and Senator Payne as fellow members of the leadership task force along with those from the other place. The first meeting of the leadership task force, independently chaired by Ms Kerri Hartland, was held last week, and the task force will be integral to ensuring progress on all of the Jenkins report recommendations, noting that not all of them are solely for government to implement as, of course, a legislative change like this is. For the recommendations that are solely within the government's responsibility and control, our intention is they be implemented within the recommended time frames. Thus far, that is on track for all of those recommendations. We are conscious that the recommendations are complex, but they are also important, especially those such as establishing the office of parliamentary standards and culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide additional protections to MOP(S) Act employees and a clear intent that not only the government but also the parliament, working together as we have demonstrated, are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Jenkins report. Significantly, the reforms and the legislative package would ensure Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces are safe and respectful, and that the nation's parliament serves as a model workplace for our nation. They help to contribute to those objectives as they work in tandem with the other reforms that have been put in place and others that are still to come, as we seek to ensure the prevention of, and appropriate responses to, any instances of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

The lack of data from the United Kingdom, the only jurisdiction where these practices are legal, should impel us to raise the threshold on these experimental gene editing techniques before we proceed in granting them a licence. The impacts and efficacy of these proposed techniques are still in theory, and thus a large number of trials should be undertaken and the results should be shared before these techniques are permitted to go ahead.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I urge senators to vote against this amendment. This bill already effectively requires successful clinical outcomes from the clinical trial phase before moving to stage 2, the use of mitochondrial donation techniques in clinical practice. As outlined in the revised explanatory memorandum, stage 2 will only commence after the clinical trial has demonstrated success over a number of years and the results have been evaluated by experts. Over that period of time it is expected that significantly more data than the minimum data proposed in this amendment will be acquired.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proponents of this amendment may say, 'Then why not put a minimum requirement in?' However, that may create the false impression that it would be appropriate to move to clinical practice once this minimum threshold has been reached and raise misplaced expectations in stakeholders. It is an important area in which we should rely upon expert assessment of the appropriateness of movement from the clinical phase of trials into clinical practice, and that we have that expert assessment of all available data, whatever is deemed to be required, to make sure there is confidence in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition this amendment could also create further legal uncertainty, as it might be that this would be the only consideration that could legally be taken into account when deciding whether to move to stage 2, with an implication that the broader range of factors intended to be taken into account couldn't be considered. I urge senators to oppose this amendment. The bill as drafted sets out very clearly the high standards required to move from trial to practice and that it is, rightly, for scientific experts to make sure those standards have been met.</span>

Indeed, there isn't really a regulator as such—certainly not a solely devoted regulator—in charge of issuing the licences associated with mitochondrial donation. It is governed completely by the NHMRC and the minister, neither of whom are themselves a dedicated regulator. That would have been ideal from the perspective of myself and others in this chamber; ideally we would have preferred to have independent arm's-length regulation through the OGTR, as we discussed last night. Those amendments have failed. It would seem, in that environment, to be prudent to put some quantitative hurdles before proceeding to a widespread clinical practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like our amendments last night, none of the amendments here stop, prevent or slow down the provision of mitochondrial donation services. Of course we'll need to have participants go through these trials, which will include, potentially, live births. There are clinical trial licences that can be issued before reaching this 20-participant threshold, so we can have real outcomes for parents going through the trials in terms of not passing on mitochondrial defects to children, if these processes work. That can happen all through the trial period; there's no limitation, through this amendment, on that occurring. We can still do all of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this amendment is accepted, we just have to do 20 trials before we would proceed to widespread clinical application outside of a more monitored trial framework. We think that is a more than reasonable number. I dismiss the arguments put by the government, through Senator Birmingham, that somehow this would be an artificial hurdle. It seems a pretty weak argument that somehow, just because we reach 20, everybody thinks we have to go to stage 2. There's nothing in this amendment which would suggest that at all. Indeed, this amendment does not get rid of the provision that Senator Birmingham highlighted which requires successful trial applications to occur before moving to stage 2. So, just because we have 20 trial participants, if none of those are successful, there are other provisions in this bill which would prevent stage 2 from occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned, though, that the term 'successful' that Senator Birmingham is relying on is not defined in the bill. Potentially it could mean just one success would be sufficient to meet that hurdle before proceeding to stage 2. It doesn't need to be plural. We know from the evidence received through the Senate committee that there is a risk through these processes of so-called off-target genetic modifications, which may not become apparent through simply one, two or a small number of mitochondrial donation processes. So it would make sense to do some larger number. The number 30 is normal in statistics. Thirty participants tends to get you a low-confidence interval when you're dealing with risk and uncertainty. We haven't gone quite as high as 30, but 20 seems like a reasonable number of participants to go through this trial, so that we have clear, risk-adjusted data on whether or not these donation processes can succeed in the broad, before proceeding to the stage 2 process.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  There are a couple of points that I would like to make in speaking to this amendment this afternoon. First of all, as we discussed a little bit last night, I think it's important to acknowledge the structural conservatism of the legislation before the chamber currently. That is to say that, if this bill passes today, it will trigger one of three stages of this overall legislative process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stage 1 is a trial of 10 years in duration. As I observed last night, on average, 56 kids are born with severe mitochondrial disease every single year. That means before we get to the point 10 years down the road of broadly offering the public and parents the opportunity to make a choice to undergo a procedure that may save the life of a child, about 560 kids may well have lost their lives. A decision has been made in the course of the crafting of this legislation—informed as it has been by multiple Senate inquiries and community consultation—that the duration of that waiting period and, therefore, the potential for that loss of life which may have been prevented by the earlier provision of these services to the public, is the correct balance to be struck. That's the proposition that has been put before the chamber by this legislation. The proposition of such a long trial period is why the proponents of this bill and the community organisations that have been campaigning for this bill see this moment as bittersweet. That's because, even if the legislation passes, they know that their suffering and sadness will be perpetuated, year on year, through many families before such a medical opportunity for the prevention of that suffering is offered to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within that context, we consider Senator O'Neill's amendment. I will note two aspects of this amendment. Firstly, that it asks us to, in addition to that 10-year trial period, and the conclusion of that 10-year time period, add another barrier to the provision of this technique to the community. It asks that we add the barrier that the procedure, the technique, be used on at least 20 trial participants, meaning that, at the conclusion of the 10-year period, there would be another benchmark to be met. I ask the chamber, and I have asked myself, whether such a number is inherently arbitrary in its nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in the House of Representatives Mr Andrews offer an amendment which was different in its nature. It asked for five positive outcomes. That's rather than 20 trial participants. But it was no less arbitrary in the selection of its number. It was five positive outcomes. It could have been 10, four, 15, 20 or 34. It was up to him. It was about what made him feel personally comfortable. So it is, too, with this amendment. Twenty trial participants are offered to us today. It could have been 15, it could have been five or it could have been 40. The proposition in this amendment is that, regardless of what has been gained through the clinical studies carried out by the NHRMC by, as we heard last night, some of the eminent minds in the nation in relation to IVF treatments, who have been doing this work so well since the early 2000s, we should add an additional barrier of an arbitrary nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that constant ticking clock of life and the suffering that will be the reality of kids that will already, as I said, be born in their hundreds between the passage of this legislation and the provision of this service to the community, I personally believe that that is an unacceptable and unnecessary additional barrier. I do not think it adds value to this legislation to insert an arbitrary number simply because it meets a level of personal comfort. This is not a scientifically informed number. This is an arbitrary number for personal comfort. We here this afternoon are considering a piece of legislation which turns upon the axis of science. So let us have faith in the experts, as we have had faith in the experts during the pandemic. Let's not put arbitrary barriers in the way of the provision of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I will make is in relation to subsection (b) of the amendment, which seeks to have the outcomes of the use of the technique on the trial participants published. We circle back again to this question of public scientific data. Last night I read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> a letter sent by one of the eminent scientific experts leading the work in the United Kingdom setting out explicitly that the absence of scientific publication of the outcome of this legislation is to in no way be interpreted as anything other than the impact of COVID-19 combining with the complexity of the United Kingdom's privacy requirements in relation to assisted reproductive techniques and that those privacy requirements are being worked through. In due course, those findings will be published. We in this Senate have no reason to believe that statement to be anything other than a true and accurate reflection of what has taken place in the United Kingdom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that this legislation gives us 10 years in which to see the findings of the UK processes that are playing out and to play our role as scrutinising legislators when making inquiries of the NHMRC. So many avenues are available to us to scrutinise this process, and we should apply ourselves to that scrutiny, not place arbitrary barriers in the way of a much-needed advancement in medical science. For those reasons I will be opposing the amendment, and I urge the entirety of my Senate colleagues, including those across the chamber, to join me in that opposition.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  Just briefly, I want to respond to some of the, I think, errors or misinterpretations of this amendment in Senator Steele-John's statement and to some of the accusations made. Senator Steele-John said that this legislation gives us 10 or more years to evaluate the trial and research phase. The legislation does not do that. The government estimates in the explanatory memorandum that the research and trial phase may take 10 years, but there is nothing in the legislation which prescribes that the research and trial phase will last 10 or more years. It could be done in two or three. There is no limit at all placed on the number of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to respond to Senator Steele-John's statement that this was not based on science at all. I only briefly mentioned this in my original contribution, but I will just lay out here that in fact there is a statistical, scientific basis for the number of 20 trial participants that we have settled on in this amendment. As I mentioned before, the outcomes that are going to come from mitochondrial donation techniques are going to be different for different people, absolutely for sure. Almost all medical treatments have different effects on different people. It would normally be possible to express the effects in some kind of normal statistical distribution, in terms of their success or failure or other attributes. When something is uncertain or provides outcomes that do not deliver a definitive result, in scientific statistics the common rule, as I mentioned in my original contribution, is that, if your sample size is at least 30, you generally will have a sample size that accords with the overall population. It's known as the central limit theorem, and the rule of thumb is that, once you get to about 30, your so called t-stat, which is what you get from a sample population, will start to converge on the limit of the z-stat which is what you get from the—almost always hypothetical—population distribution. So 30 is usually the figure used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't choose 30, because we can see that in the UK, after almost eight years of work, they have only had eight participants go through, so, if 30 were chosen as a threshold, it might be a generation's time before we go into that clinical phase. So, even though 30 would be the statistical, scientific number, we thought it would be more reasonable to choose a lower number: 20. Keep in mind that you've already had eight go through in the UK, without a single successful live birth, so an additional 12 on top of that number of participants seems a fairly reasonable request of the science in this regard. Yes, that will take a number of years, but in no way, as I said before, will that hold up the provision of these services, because the provision of the services can occur right now. Once the bill passes—if the bill passes—the provision of mitochondrial donation services can occur straightaway, not through the clinical practice process but through a trial process. So no-one will be denied or unnecessarily delayed in their provision of the services. Of course, while the trial is occurring, they'll be subject to significant monitoring and oversight, which are the conditions that are placed in this bill. I do think it's reasonable that 20—or at least something like 20—participants go through such a trial phase so we understand all of the different potential effects that might occur in different people with different genetic structures as best we can before going through to the clinical practice stage, where there is less oversight and less intense activity than would be associated with a trial phase.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  I would like to make a number of comments on this in support of Senator O'Neill's amendment. First of all, I would like to commend Senator O'Neill and Senator Canavan. I support his earlier comments of 20 minutes ago and will not be repeating them. I support them very strongly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw attention to Senator Birmingham's comments and in particular to Senator Birmingham's assumption that parliament will make the right decision 10 years from now, well into the future. That has been misplaced, unfounded. In fact, we see that quite often in this parliament it has a history—and I don't just mean this parliament; I mean parliaments for many decades now—of senators and members in the lower house making decisions that not only weren't based in data but contradict the data. Now, here we are, forecasting what will be the case in 10 years time. That's why Senator Canavan's and Senator O'Neill's amendments and their speeches are so important. We have a history of ignoring and even contradicting the hard data, and now we're forecasting 10 years into the future. We're assuming success, as Senator Canavan said, without a definition of success. That's not scientific; that's absurd. Uncertainty and risk abound everywhere. We haven't seen what's come out of the United Kingdom yet. The level of confidence in this is very, very low. I'm reminded of President Eisenhower warning us of the military-industrial complex. In that same speech, which most people know about—they don't know about this statement—he also warned us about the science and technology agenda and to not assume that experts know what they're talking about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're sitting here in masks, and there's no evidence anywhere that they have any effect. There's plenty of evidence showing they don't. Many of the senators right now have been double injected, whatever that means—fully injected, whatever that means—because that'll change; we haven't had any evidence on that and we've seen evidence of severe adverse effects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see protesters out the front, some of whom who have been injected, saying that they are opposed to the coercion. Will we see this coercion continue for the next 10 years and fulfil Senator Canavan's concerns? I'll read a text here from someone coming down from Queensland: 'We're on our way to Canberra today, taking a car full of people. Thanks, once again, for everything we're doing for truth in this most critical time.' Truth in a parliament! Fancy being thanked for telling the truth. 'Whoever would have thought in our lifetimes we would see the removal of our freedoms and the destruction of our democracy.' This lady is a mature, very strong, very intelligent lady who has concerns about what is happening to our country and the loss of freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go to another: 'Compliance and blind faith have been the problem. People have been taught to trust people in positions of power.' Here we are, going into the future unknown and making forecasts as to what'll happen and what will be successful and won't be successful. I have no faith in experts—it is just a label. I have faith in data. I have no faith in parliamentarians. That's why I will be supporting Senator Canavan and Senator O'Neill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles"> the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I rise in support of Senator O'Neill's amendment. I acknowledge and give support to the comments of Senator Canavan. I think it's important for senators to remember the lack of data around the very scheme that we are being asked to legalise. There is a significant lack of data. It is the case that this technique would create a human being the type of which is expressly prohibited from being created today—that is, a human being with three people contributing to its genetic make-up. In this debate I've heard some senators make claims that none of the mitochondrial DNA actually affects the unique characteristics of who we are. That's not entirely true. In fact, I would encourage senators to read the report that came out of the 2018 Senate inquiry. We simply do not know the scientific effects on future generations of altering mitochondrial DNA. We simply do not know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate report went into this in some detail. The Senate report said this was 'a foundational question to be answered prior to any legalisation of mitochondrial donation'. Let me repeat that. This is a Senate report. These are not dissenting comments; this was a cross-partisan report from an inquiry chaired by our former colleague Greens senator Rachel Siewert, who did remarkable work. I was a member of that inquiry. It said that this is 'a foundational question to be answered prior to any legalisation of mitochondrial donation'. I would argue, based on the lack of evidence available to us—in fact, I did argue this in my speech on the second reading—that we have not answered that foundational question. In being asked to vote on this bill, we have a foundational question that has not been resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come to how this amendment improves slightly on the bill by helping us try to put in a stage where that foundational question is resolved. Allow me to remind senators: in the United States, this technique is expressly prohibited. It is not permitted in the United States. The only jurisdiction that has legalised mitochondrial donation is the United Kingdom. We know that from the debate. In 2015, they legalised it. The department of health in the United Kingdom states on its website, 'We have limited evidence on risks and success rates,' of mitochondrial donation. That is undeniably true. In over six years, no baby has been born in the United Kingdom using mitochondrial donation. There have been reports—unverified reports—of babies born in Mexico and Ukraine. They have not been subject to any independent scientific verification or determination of whether or not the children are healthy or, indeed, whether they were born alive and healthy. We are literally legislating in the absence of evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard some senators make the observation that we should rely on science. I would be quite happy to rely on science. The reality is there isn't much science available to us in legalising this. I understand the arguments that Senator Steele-John puts: that this is a multistage process and we're going to have these clinical trials and we're going to get the science. If we're going to get it, what is so wrong with this parliament ensuring that there is a robust evidentiary base and that it is publicly verifiable? That is what this amendment does. It is this parliament's way of saying that if we are going to move to the next stage then we should be sure that there is a robust evidence base and that it is publicly verifiable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just about trusting the science; we also need to share it with the public. We need to take the public with us if we're going to make changes like this. Imagine where we would have been in COVID if we hadn't had information available to us to make decisions about booster shots, about vaccination, about mask wearing and about social distancing. We took the public with us, because we were able to share the science with them. That is what this amendment does. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the United Kingdom, there have been 21 licences granted for mitochondrial donations since 2015, and as many as eight have been subsequently approved for treatment. However, there is no public reporting available for these outcomes. Senator Steele-John posits the argument—I'm not quarrelling with him—that this might be because of COVID and it might be because of privacy concerns. If we take the latter—privacy concerns that haven't been resolved—that's a failure of the UK parliament that we should not repeat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan moved an amendment about the clinical trial stage not automatically moving on after 10 years. That was voted down by the Senate. We also sought last night to put in a stronger regulatory regime through amendments. That was also rejected by the Senate. I acknowledge that. But what I would say in response to arguments put by Senator Birmingham is that there's nothing automatic in here. This does not automatically move us, after 20 trials, to the next stage. And this is the kind of thing we do in legislation all the time—we put in things in the legislation so that, if something is going to move on to another stage, appropriate benchmarks have been met before that happens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my frustration here is that this is not a barrier to moving on to the next stage of a mitochondrial donation; it is actually a safeguard. I do think, when we are legalising a technique where there is almost no verifiable scientific evidence to answer what our own Senate committee found to be a foundational question, that is it is entirely legitimate—indeed, it's entirely unremarkable—for the Senate to ask that there be some robust evidentiary base and that it be shared with the public. That's all this amendment does. It doesn't seek to create a legal barrier. It doesn't seek to exclude any other consideration. I've heard some senators raise a concern that perhaps you need more than 20 trials. Perhaps you do, but how will we know that unless we're able to be confident that 20 have happened and we're able to see the evidence for ourselves and take the public with us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would encourage senators to just consider that we are legislating for something that is going to go for more than 10 years. We are legislating for something where decisions are going to be taken by executive governments. People who might sit in those positions may not have even been elected to parliament yet. We have given away our capacity to have that decision come back to the chamber. We did that last night in rejecting one of Senator Canavan's amendments. We missed an opportunity to get a stronger regulatory regime in place for what is a novel and untested technique. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is simply making the rather unremarkable request that we have a solid evidence base and that it is publicly verifiable and able to be examined by the parliament and by the Australian people. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I wanted to quickly respond to a couple of things in relation to the contributions from Senators Canavan and Keneally. First of all, in relation to the view that Senator Keneally has put to the chamber that we as a body should take note of the absence of the legalisation of these techniques in the United States, I put to the chamber that that is not a factor that should factor into our consideration. There are many legislated differences between Australia and the United States, which I'm sure we all welcome. At the top of my mind is gun control. We have very good gun control in Australia; there is a catastrophic absence of that in the United States. The United States's legislative framework shouldn't feed into our considerations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I turn to the comment that Senator Keneally made in relation to the privacy settings that exist in the United Kingdom and whether they should be fixed before the legislation passes. Privacy in relation to facilitated reproductive techniques is paramount. It's paramount in IVF techniques across the board. Why is it paramount? Senator Rice will be very familiar with this phenomenon as well. People born of medically facilitated techniques are often considered, in religious contexts, to be abominations and are subject to profound discrimination. So it is very important that we guarantee the privacy of those individuals. On Senator Keneally's point, I would also say that this is a trial. What's so wrong with inserting a number?—simply because it is arbitrary. It is an arbitrary number, as Senator Canavan said—something like 20. Well, why not 10? Why not five? Why not nine? It is arbitrary and there is no place in a scientific trial for us to insert ourselves in that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I make mention of the contributions made last night and today that touch on the rights of a child born of more than two parents. I simply put to you that we have two choices before ourselves today: to pass this piece of legislation or to not pass this piece of legislation—to pass it in a form that works or to put it in a form that hampers this work. If we take the path of passing these amendments, or voting down this bill, we will never have the opportunity to ask the individuals potentially born of these techniques what they would wish in relation to these rights. However, if people in this chamber are really very interested in having conversations with individuals born of complicated facilitated medical techniques then let us pass this bill and, in a decade, have the opportunity to ask them.</span>

I was originally quite sympathetic to this amendment, and in fact had informed Senator O'Neill that I'd probably support it. I now think it is not an appropriate amendment to support. I can see where it's coming from—the need to ensure there's appropriate scrutiny, accountability and transparency—good data and really good scrutiny of the trial. But the arbitrary nature of 20 participants doesn't provide that appropriateness. There's a much more complex lot of factors that you need to take into account, rather than having an arbitrary 20 participants go through a trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of the amendment that I was sympathetic to was the need for published data. It is an issue that, for whatever reason, we have not got any published data out of the UK trial. That said, essentially we're beginning a trial. Yes, we absolutely need the scientific evidence; that is the whole purpose of this first stage of the trial. I also note that we do, in fact, have NHMRC at every estimates—if we want to have them—where they can be questioned, and if the Senate feels that they are not doing an appropriate job of oversighting this trial then it is open to us to put more measures in place. So I put on the record that, having considered this very thoroughly, I've decided not to support this amendment.</span>

We saw it yesterday, with the finance minister issuing numbers from the Liberal Party's costing of Labor Party commitments—what could possibly go wrong there?—and all the bluster around that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to make it clear that Labor will not be taking any lectures on fiscal responsibility from the Morrison government. We're not going to be lectured by finance ministers and treasurers who have delivered a trillion dollars of debt and eight consecutive budget deficits after promising surplus budgets in the first year and every year after that. When you look at the facts of this government's budget management, you can see why we won't be taking lectures. They're the second-highest-taxing government in the last 30 years—trumped only by the Howard government, I might add. They hid $16 billion in the budget, to be rolled out at election time. They wasted and rorted billions and billions of dollars through various funds that they've established to buy votes; there were 21 slush funds set up in the last budget alone. They spent $1 billion in government advertising; they can always find a bit of spare coin for that. Then there are the billions in costs wasted on dumping the French submarine contract; we know that's about $2.4 billion, with more to come. And there's $19.7 billion going in JobKeeper to companies that actually increased their revenue during the pandemic.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Last night I spoke in the chamber about the significant risk that a Labor-Greens alliance poses to Australian jobs and the national economy if ever Labor were to be elected. The Greens' proposed moratorium on the mining of coal, gas and oil—which Labor will be forced to accept in any hung parliament or power-sharing arrangement—will bring this country to its knees: 80,000 jobs, including 50,000 in construction, and $500 billion in investment will go. With Labor's reckless COVID commitments, including paying every Australian $300 to get vaccinated, this would have cost an extra $81 billion. This is the brutal truth, Senator Gallagher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is frightening to consider Labor being in control of the treasury bench. In fact, Labor is so incompetent that it can't even add up what's required to fund a basic road project. In Geelong, the Morrison government is proudly funding stage 1 of the Barwon Heads Road Duplication—$292 million, or 80 per cent of the total cost. This is a vital road upgrade for Marshall, Armstrong Creek and Charlemont residents and those living in Barwon Heads, Ocean Grove and beyond. This funding was agreed by our government after Daniel Andrews and state Labor reneged on their commitment to fund 100 per cent of this road upgrade. Our wonderful Liberal candidate is advocating hard for stage 2. It's a $250 million project, and, consistent with the funding agreement, 80 per cent, or $200 million, is required. But what's Labor's commitment for stage 2? A paltry $125 million, a $75 million black hole on this road project. Under Labor, we had the carbon tax, the mining tax, the closure of Ford, the cancellation of the $1 billion howitzer project, the backflip on the East West Link and the refusal to fund the Great Ocean Road, and now Labor can't even fund a basic road project. We cannot afford to risk Labor.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  As I said in my first speech, we've been tackling the issue of violence against women all wrong. We have to stop thinking of this as a women's-only issue; it's a societal issue that disproportionately affects women and children. After decades of working as an activist, advocate and consultant in the gender equality space, I know the statistics all too well. As a First Nations woman, I know we are 35 times more likely to experience family violence and 10 times more likely to experience death because of family violence. As a Black feminist, a mother, an advocate and now a senator, I want to end violence against women and girls. In this place, it's our responsibility to commit to preventing violence from happening to our children and our grandchildren, and it's our responsibility to ensure the safety of women at home, at work and in public. We must take abuse in all forms more seriously and commit to structural change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The draft National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children is ours for consultation. While it recognises that gender equality is key to tackling the end to violence against women, it fails to detail how that will actually be achieved. I heard very clearly Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins at the National Press Club yesterday talk about how violence needs to be taken much more seriously, how we need structural reform and how we need more education about violence against women and girls. The Greens have already committed the $1 billion a year that is needed to ensure that programs are fully funded and that no-one is turned away from frontline services. To put that into perspective, the government spends 10 times that on subsidies for their fossil fuel mates. I've had enough with this Morrison government's half-baked attempts to eliminate violence against women. It's time to kick the Liberals out and put the Greens in balance of power.</span>

This is especially true in the seat of Boothby. Boothby feels the impacts of climate change very, very keenly. People in the hills know the threat of bushfire; they've lived through it, and they know that without real climate action things will only get worse. They'll see more fires burning more intensely. People on the coast know exactly what rising sea levels will mean for them, and no-one wants to see that loss of coastline from Glenelg to Brighton or anywhere else. The incredible natural environment throughout the electorate—Brownhill Creek, Belair National Park and so many other sites—is at risk as the climate changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Louise Miller-Frost, the Labor candidate for Boothby, tells me that it is a consistent issue that is raised with her on the ground. Louise is looking to work hard to deliver climate action, and an important part of what she's fighting for is Labor's Powering Australia plan, which will result in more jobs, cleaner energy and lower power bills. Creating jobs and reducing carbon emissions: this is what the people of Boothby are crying out for, and this is what Louise Miller-Frost and Labor intend to deliver. People in Boothby know that the climate is changing and they want to see this parliament take action. They want to see their representatives take action.</span>

When the rules for remote participation operate, the system is available to senators prevented from attending the Senate because of COVID-19 related travel restrictions, quarantine requirements or personal health advice. While the basis for the rules applying to an individual will sometimes be readily apparent, particularly when border restrictions or quarantine requirements are in place, it is not the practice of the President and Deputy President to inquire into the nature of the personal health advice an individual senator may have. By seeking to participate remotely, individual senators are representing to the Senate that they fall within the ambit of the rules, and the chair takes that at face value. It is for individual senators to determine the extent to which they wish to explain the basis on which they are participating remotely.</span>

The fact is: we've spoken about transgender people, we've spoken about gays and lesbians, but you're standing up fighting for an issue that doesn't really come into the equation when we have millions of Australians being forced to have injections against their will, losing their jobs, losing their homes and who are suiciding. This has actually happened to Australians. But you gutless wonders in that place there have not taken the chance to actually go out and talk to them and listen to them. You've shut down debate in that parliament on behalf of many Australians, and I will continue to fight for them on their behalf. Talk about discrimination! You are pathetic because you haven't given them the chance to have their voices heard. Listen to their concerns; that's what it's about. Yet you pick and choose what you want to say is discrimination. It is a shame. Shame on all of you! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The zoo participates in the Tasmanian devil breeding program, contributing strong stock that has bolstered the national devil population and increased genetic diversity for the threatened species. Another Tasmanian Zoo success is the critically endangered northern white-cheeked gibbon, with the zoo's pair welcoming a baby last August. This tiny gibbon is one of just a handful born in captivity in the world, and the first in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Besides cute gibbons, fluffy red pandas, strutting cheetahs and hundreds of other animals, I must mention the zoo's newest residents: two 18-month-old giraffes named Hunter and Tallbert. These half-brothers were born at Australia Zoo, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, and are the first giraffes to call Tasmania home. It was a huge financial and logistical commitment for Rochelle to bring the giraffes to Tasmania, with help from the SeaRoad and Zoo 2 Zoo transport companies, CEVA Logistics, a team of zookeepers and a vet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coronavirus pandemic presented Tasmania Zoo with a different kind of logistical issue: feeding and caring for hundreds of animals while being closed for six months. During my recent visit to the zoo, Ms Penney expressed her gratitude for the Australian government's zoo and aquarium COVID-19 support package, which helped them out during that difficult time. Our government is making sure businesses like Tasmania Zoo can continue playing a vital role in protecting at-risk species and educating and entertaining visitors.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  The government will soon release the new <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report, an independent five-yearly assessment of our environment. Unfortunately, this report will very much make for grim reading. As we learned from Professor Samuel's review of the EPBC Act, our environment is in an unsustainable decline, and this government is yet to make any real change that will slow the decline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One important part of the report will look at Australia's air quality. While our air quality is clean by global standards, there are persistent issues that require attention and action. One concern is particulate matter from cars and trucks, which affects urban and regional communities. Some regional communities also face excessive pollution from local industrial activities. As we learned two years ago, bushfires can have a devastating impact on air quality. The significance of good air quality cannot be overstated. It is not just important for general health or for those with breathing difficulties; it also has huge effects on our children's wellbeing. One of the best things we can do to improve our children's education and health is to simply ensure the air they breathe is clean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you add up the health, education and workforce impacts of pollution, the costs are truly enormous, and they completely outweigh the benefits of allowing polluting activities to continue. So I sincerely hope that this government acts on this new report and takes seriously the concerns it raises about air quality. It should move quickly to improve air quality monitoring throughout Australia and to implement policies to improve air quality in our schools and in our communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  I rise to offer my condolences to the family of Craig McGregor and to speak about his remarkable contribution to journalism and to Australian writing. Craig started his career at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span>, but his writing found its way everywhere, from the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> to the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Times</span>. He wrote more than 19 groundbreaking books on Australian politics and culture, along with two novels and two collections of short stories. It was all complemented by a capacity to write poetry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His colleague David Leser described it in this way:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Craig McGregor was one of the blazing stars in the Australian intellectual and cultural firmament. For more than 60 years he wrote about everything from politics, class, popular culture, surfing and architecture to love, sex, desire and marriage. His skills were vast and many, matched only by his limitless curiosity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 8½ metres of his personal materials now held in the National Library are testament to this curiosity. A quick scan reveals notes on Patrick White, on Bruce Dawe, on Barry Humphries, on music, on photography and, of course, on the many political figures that he profiled, for which he is so fondly remembered by both journos and pollies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Craig and his wife, Jane, in 2001, when I was a candidate in the federal election. Craig was living on the North Coast, a place of enormous personal significance to him. Craig planted the pandanus and casuarina trees that now stand along the front at Wategos Beach. Craig was keen to talk, and he invited me into his beautiful home. He was a lovely conversationalist, engaging deeply and intelligently with the issues that confronted Labor nationally and locally. He approached these most serious issues with a unique, joyful spirit. Both Craig and Jane offered enormously generous personal and political support to me, and I will always be so grateful. My condolences.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Victorian government and AusNet's contentious Western Victoria Transmission Network Project. This project seeks to construct an electricity transmission network through 190 kilometres of western Victorian farmland. I recently met with the CEO of the Moorabool Shire Council, and he succinctly explained the impact that this project would have across the shire. And this is only one shire facing these problems. The residents of Moorabool Shire acknowledge and are supportive of the efforts to connect and power western Victoria with renewable energy; however, the shire believes that the current plans will pose destabilising and ongoing effects to the environment and economic livelihood of the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the agricultural industry across Moorabool Shire generates $260 million in exports per annum, which equates to a third of the shire's exports, and supports 800 jobs. The direct loss of prime agricultural land due to the acquisition, construction and placing of easements for the project would jeopardise the lifeblood of the region. Seeking to improve the plans, the residents have commissioned an independent review of the project and, as such, believe that these transmission lines can and should be placed underground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must note that the member for Ballarat has previously voiced her concerns about this project. I, too, like the member for Ballarat, would like to see this issue surrounding the wider project resolved. However, it appears that the member's comrades on Spring Street are not willing to listen to the voices of the affected communities, and this has real consequences: the destruction of the environment, the destruction of livelihoods and, once again, the destruction of rural representation. It cannot be clearer. What is needed is a workable and practical solution that incorporates the input of the affected shires and farmers, not the expedient dictates of the Victorian Labor Party. The project must be re-examined and redrawn as a matter of urgency.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  There's been a lot of talk about the aged-care minister choosing to spend three days at the cricket while the aged-care sector was, and does remain, in crisis. He did this instead of turning up to a Senate COVID committee. Like everyone else in this parliament, Minister Colbeck has to decide how to use his time. I have to balance priorities all of the time. And no-one would begrudge the minister going to the cricket. He is the sports minister. But really? Three days? That was not an exercise of good judgement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think what that does show us is the fact that, whilst we've got this pandemic, whilst we've got this crisis that has been brought home by the royal commission, we need to have a focus on aged care. So I'm trying to be helpful here and say to the government that we need to have an aged care minister that is solely focused on aged care—not two portfolios, not three portfolios, but one portfolio, one minister for aged care looking after aged-care people. Our elderly deserve that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also deserve the implementation of the recommendations of the royal commission on aged care. We've seen a debacle this week in relation to the Religious Discrimination Bill in this place. We could have been dealing with the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill 2021 that is on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, helping our aged-care sector. I've got an amendment in there that gives us nurses in aged care 24/7. It raises the standard of care. We need to do that. Ageing should be a privilege, not a punishment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Providing quality education is the core business of our universities. I've met with university representatives and locals about the proposed move of the Hobart campus of the University of Tasmania, UTAS, from Sandy Bay to the Hobart CBD. In addition to offering direct education, universities often foster the development of businesses—big and small—research and many other activities on and around their campuses. UTAS is special in that it is the only one in Tasmania. So decisions to move a university campus will have an impact on many more people, organisations, businesses and those that are directly associated with the university. We need to make sure it is the right move. Any decision to move the campus rather than to renovate and redevelop the existing site requires resourcing, both in finances and in personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A Save UTAS group made up of community members, current and former University of Tasmania academics, business operators and UTAS students has formed and is launching a petition against the campus relocation. I will continue to meet with stakeholders. Senator Bilyk and I will be meeting with the vice-chancellor and representatives from the University of Tasmania in coming weeks. The University of Tasmania is highly valued and regarded by the people of Tasmania. We must never lose sight of the need to maintain student amenity and educational and research outcomes as the priority for the university.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  Labor's critics of the reinsurance pool don't live in the north, and they don't reflect the lived experience of thousands of people in the north. In the north we pay more for electricity, building materials, flights and insurance. Our premiums are at least 2½ times what people in the south pay, and that's if insurance companies will even look at you. It's especially grim for businesses. Many are forced to self-insure because no insurance companies will give them coverage.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government listened, consulted and acted. The $10 billion reinsurance pool will reduce household premiums by up to 46 per cent, give strata title properties a discount of up to 58 per cent and give small-to-medium enterprises a discount of up to 34 per cent. The Townsville Chamber of Commerce calculated that if just two-thirds of the projected savings were spent in the city annually there would be approximately $220 million in economic output—a contribution of $118 million to gross regional product, over $60 million in income and salaries for local workers, and approximately 949 ongoing full-time jobs created, directly and indirectly, through multiplier effects. These numbers did not include reductions in small business premiums. If they did, we would see even greater benefits.</span>

Former New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said, 'All four of my grandparents were orphaned and witnessed untold atrocities'—against the Armenian people in 1915. More than 40 of her relatives were killed. Nine's newspapers reported on the weekend that staff in the Prime Minister's office referred disparagingly to the former Premier of New South Wales Gladys Berejiklian as 'Anne Frank'. Why is the Prime Minister's office using Anne Frank's name to disparage Gladys Berejiklian?</span>

We would have welcomed that particular former New South Wales premier entering the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister has been very clear in relation to his very high regard for her, and I am confident that he would have no tolerance for any such references were they to be made in any place.</span>

As I said, I haven't seen the allegations, and forgive me for the fact that I don't take everything at face value in the way it's framed in questions from the opposition, because I've learnt in this job, over time, that the distortions in the way questions can be presented often add a tone of misrepresentation to what apparently occurred. But the Prime Minister's respect for Ms Berejiklian is paramount and significant. He holds her in the highest regard, and his intolerance for such references or statements would be equally high.</span>

Just because Senator Keneally picks up the mud bucket and throws it around doesn't mean there's any accuracy to it. Those opposite are demonstrating, as they do time and time again, as they do question time after question time, that they're only interested in character assassination. They're only interested in making it a personality contest; they're not interested in policies. As we've highlighted in this place, they come in here, they sling mud at Senator Colbeck, but they never propose an alternative aged-care policy, do they? No; they never do that, of course. They are an opposition bereft of any ideas, bereft of any direction, bereft of any substance, with a leader who flip-flops on policies depending on where they're at. They're an opposition who came up with $81 billion of extra spending ideas during the course of the pandemic, but then say we should have budget repair. They demonstrate that they've got no idea.</span>

Under this coalition government, Australia is working with our partners to advance our values and shared interests. This week, in fact, brings engagements with eight of my foreign minister counterparts. Tomorrow, the Quad foreign ministers' meeting with India, the United States and Japan will take place in Melbourne. With External Affairs Minister Jaishankar, Foreign Minister Hayashi and Secretary of State Blinken, Australia continues to pursue an agenda for a free and open Indo-Pacific through ambitious practical cooperation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, we've also had a four-way virtual call with Minister Magno and our counterparts from Indonesia and New Zealand, Ministers Marsudi and Mahuta. Four female foreign ministers in our region sends a very powerful message. We discussed advocacy and action on the Women, Peace and Security agenda, and once again I expressed Australia's strong support for the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific.</span>

Minister Wong and I particularly reinforced Australia's commitment in our discussions to partnering with Papua New Guinea on our shared COVID-19 response and recovery. All of our partners are committed to building a free and open region, deeply engaging with a range of partners to support our vision for an open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific.</span>

Most critical is the COVID response. I'm pleased to report that the Quad has now delivered more than 500 million vaccines under our 1.3 billion dose commitment. We will also discuss further cooperation to defend against malicious cyberattacks and dangerous disinformation; to enhance maritime security in our region; to support infrastructure development; to enhance climate action by working together on clean energy supply chains; and to assist our Indo-Pacific partners when they face crises such as the volcanic eruption and tsunami that so recently devastated Tonga. The Quad agenda is positive and it is practical. It works alongside our other relationships, including, importantly, with ASEAN, which, founded in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, lies at the heart of the Indo-Pacific.</span>

And, as I said earlier, during COVID we've put additional payments in place to support senior Australians and pensioners to help them through the COVID pandemic. So I acknowledge the comments that Senator Sheldon is making in relation to the recent CPI increases, but those things are taken into account in the regular CPI increases that are undertaken for the pension. The pension rates increased on 20 September by $14.80 for singles and $22.40 for couples combined, and new maximum fortnightly rates, including pension supplement and energy supplements, are $967.50 for singles and $1,458.60 for couples.</span>

We are committed to protecting Australians of faith and those not of faith from discrimination on the basis of their religion. And, as I said, the bill passed the House of Representatives last night. We made a commitment to the Australian people at the last election that we would, on this issue, address it, and we are progressing that commitment. But when amendments passed the House of Representatives, supported by the right of Labor, that have the potential impact of actually increasing the discrimination and the grounds of discrimination that can actually now be against students, we take that seriously. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are still in the dark as to whether the government will bring on the bill. The media is full of headlines: 'Bill on ice', 'Indefinitely delayed', 'Bill not proceed'. Minister, given that, and I take it that it's not going to proceed, why won't you commit to taking meaningful action to protect people of faith rather than this sham bill which was the rushed product of right-wing culture wars?</span>

We believe in protecting people of faith from discrimination, and we made a commitment to the Australian people. We consulted widely, across the board, and we presented to the parliament what was a fair and reasonable bill. It honoured our commitment to people of faith to protect them from discrimination on the basis of their religion. Senator Rice, do you think it is fair for a Muslim to be discriminated against in employment? Do you think it is fair? Do you think it is fair for a Sikh to be discriminated against in employment?

                  </a>  Yes we have, Senator Rice. If you actually believed in protections, you would have read the amendment that passed the House of Representatives last night. There are very, very serious potential consequences for sections 38 and 37 of the Sex Discrimination Act because of the way it is drafted. Do you know what it has the effect of, Mr President? Potentially increasing the grounds for discrimination against students and prospective students.</span>

I don't think that is a level of detail that we should go to. As I have indicated to the chamber recently, we have done some calculations of the number of shifts that we believe might not be being filled based on the number of staff that have had COVID. Based on some information as of 4 February, for affected facilities we believe the accumulative infection rate is nearly 13 per cent of the workforce on average and just over five per cent concurrently. That relates to the impact on facilities of COVID-19 and therefore the shifts that are being filled, particularly in relation to COVID.</span>

In the advice to the sector provided early in the pandemic, providers themselves were required to have capacity to fill a certain proportion of shifts themselves. We have said where that capacity became overwhelmed we would come in and support them with the surge workforce, and that's what we've done. That's what we have done, and we've continued to build the surge workforce to assist the sector to manage COVID-19 and their workforce shortages.</span>

Again, Labor is dishonestly taking out of context comments that I made about the performance of the sector versus the circumstance with respect to the filling of shifts through the surge workforce. As I said in my previous answer, the surge workforce was not designed, never was designed, to fill every vacant shift in residential aged care during COVID. It was there to provide assistance to providers who weren't able to fill specific shifts in certain circumstances of extreme need. That's what we've done. We've provided support for over 80,000 shifts. We've continued to build that capacity as we've been able to and put additional resources towards it, and we will continue to support the sector as they work their way through the pandemic.</span>

It is a very similar question to one that I addressed yesterday or the day before in relation to the types of reviews that could be undertaken. The Prime Minister has been very clear that right now, in the here and now, the government's priority remains on the response to the pandemic. In responding to the pandemic in Australia and working together, the Commonwealth government, state and territory governments, business, community, health experts and service providers in particular have all managed to achieve some outstanding outcomes in comparison to the rest of the world. Across Australia, we retain one of the lowest fatality rates, one of the highest vaccination rates and some of the strongest economic outcomes. They have all been very important, hard-fought outcomes that Australians as a whole have contributed to, and they have responded to all those messages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister also acknowledged that there will be time for appropriate reviews and inquiries to look at the management of COVID-19. Of course, we have had in this chamber an ongoing review process through the COVID select committee that was established, but I'm sure there will be processes that look back, once we can put the pandemic more clearly in the rear-view mirror. The exact nature of such reviews and inquiries will be matters to be discussed with states and territories and others at the time. Whilst it will be important to have a look at preparedness and readiness for the handling of future crises and other uncertainties, and to look at what has gone right or wrong, I would, as I did in my response the other day, also just caveat that with the fact that the next pandemic or the next crisis will be quite different, no doubt, to this one. So, while there will be lessons to be learned, we shouldn't pretend that anything will always provide preparation for all of the uncertainties we may face. </span>

And that is that we are not about to introduce legislation to override the states and territories in these matters. We have supported vaccine mandates only in the most limited of circumstances, as Senator Colbeck and others have worked through. Those limited circumstances are for high-risk settings such as aged care. Beyond that, we have strongly encouraged all Australians to get vaccinated and more than 94 per cent have responded by being double-dose vaccinated. We have strongly encouraged people to have the third-dose booster, and many millions have responded by receiving the third-dose booster. </span>

As we know, the coalition government's first priority is the security of the nation and its people—keeping Australians safe from those who seek to do us harm.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIO and our law enforcement agencies are alive to the threats that our nation faces, and they work tirelessly to both detect and deter those threats on a daily basis. The national security environment in Australia is a dynamic one, and it's an ever-evolving one. That is why the government continually reviews the legislation and the capabilities that our agencies need to detect, intercept and respond to the emerging security needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen online radicalisation continue to evolve and become a greater security threat to Australia and to our way of life. The director-general addressed this in his speech last night. We know that, as a result of COVID-19, this threat has continued to increase. However, we also know that, as Australians, this is not the only threat that we are currently facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the pervasive threat of foreign interference is rapidly growing in both scale and proportion. As the director-general stated last night, foreign interference has become a 'principal security concern' for Australia. This is not to 'downplay the significance' of the threat of terrorism, but foreign interference is 'demanding more attention and resources'. That is why the Morrison-Joyce government always ensures that our national security legislation is strengthened and up to date. We've passed 27 tranches of national security legislation since 2014.</span>

This funding includes $24.5 million to expand the CVE deradicalisation activities; $4.7 million to build on and extend efforts to combat terrorist propaganda online by identifying extremist material for removal; and $10.7 million to a new CVE grants program that will increase awareness and build community resilience to violent extremism.</span>

Minister, you would be aware that other communities are fighting against proposals for oil and gas drilling off their coasts, including King Island in Tasmania, off the Twelve Apostles in the Otway Basin in Victoria, Senator Thorpe's own Gunditjmara country and off the Ningaloo Reef in the Carnarvon Basin. Many of these people don't feel these are the right projects for their communities. Will you also make a political intervention to protect these communities and their environments?

It goes in a range of different directions and 'cancelled projects' is right at the top of their favourite list. From cancelled projects, they like cancelled jobs, as Senator Cash says. Cancel business, cancel outcomes for Australia, cancel growth, cancel projects, cancel jobs: it's very much the Greens way. But the point I was making was that there is a process arrangement put in place in relation to how PEP-11 was considered.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:48</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Senator Colbeck. Last week, a 79-year-old woman who had waited 3½ hours for her pain medication to be provided at the Jeta Gardens nursing home ended up throwing herself off a third-floor balcony. She broke her leg and multiple other bones. The incident report lists neglect as a contributing factor. Only a registered nurse can deliver pain drugs, and, on that day, there was only one nurse rostered for more than 160 residents. Minister, all week I have been asking you about the Jeta Gardens nursing home, about which you were warned twice by your own regulator. Why are older Australians in residential aged care still being neglected by this minister in his aged-care system?</span>

                  </a>  I will take the interjection because that's a complete absurdity. The Serious Incident Response Scheme, introduced by this government, has been designed specifically to properly investigate serious incidents and then report them—and report them publicly. So I reject any assertion from the opposition that we are seeking to cover this up. We have a legislative process that this government put in place to investigate those incidents appropriately and then report them—and report them publicly. That's what we will do. I'm not going to presume here in this place, before the investigation has been completed, and then appropriately reported, as to the cause of it in the way that Senator Watt has. I think it's an absolute disgrace that he comes in here to make those sorts of assertions without the appropriate process to investigate what's going on. I am as concerned as Senator Watt is about the event that occurred at Jeta Gardens. I'm as concerned as anybody. We all are. Those sorts of circumstances should not be occurring in our aged-care facilities. That's why we have over $18 billion on the table, in a five-year reform package, when the Labor Party has absolutely nothing.</span>

As I have acknowledged here before, the Australian government is responsible for the approving of approved providers and also the regulation, and predominantly the funding, of residential aged-care providers. All through the pandemic, it has been my view and the government's view that visitor access to residents is very important. It was raised by the royal commission in their special COVID-19 report. The AHPPC put some advice out to the sector about it. And I'm very pleased to say that the sector has come around to the same point of view. But, of course, the actions of the opposition are making it harder to let people into residential aged-care facilities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That's been done. In fact, there is a team of people who are working in that facility to do that.</span>

On the evening of Saturday 15 January, I received a call of a kind I dread, of course, as minister for the Pacific, with news that one of our Pacific family had just suffered a devastating natural disaster. The explosive eruption of underwater volcano Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai and subsequent tsunami was declared an unprecedented disaster by Tonga's Prime Minister in the days following.</span>

We've delivered 190 tonnes of humanitarian support to date with more to come. Thirteen RAAF humanitarian assistance flights have landed, carrying essential supplies and equipment, including food, water and shelter for families who lost their homes, medical supplies to support those who were injured and communications equipment so that friends and family in Australia and elsewhere could contact their loved ones.</span>

I acknowledge the presence of one of our partners in the region: my good friend Jelta Wong, who is with us in the gallery.</span>

While we on this side take a strong stand with our partners in the region and, indeed, across the world, Senator Wong won't condemn former Labor Prime Minister Keating for his appeasement of China.

He voted to unwind our strong borders under the Rudd-Gillard government, and he has flip-flopped on everything. Now of course he has the Greens in his ear, holding him to ransom, demanding that he cut the defence budget in half—costing jobs and harming our national security.

At the 2019 election there was not a dollar for home care, not a dollar for mainstream residential aged care and not a dollar for workforce. They come in here with no policy, over a full term of parliament, and no response to the royal commission almost a year after the royal commission reported. We have a full response to every single recommendation of the royal commission and $18.3 billion on the table. What have Labor got? Zip! Nothing! What a disgrace! They come in here to play politics, but we come in here to fix the problems of aged care. We called the royal commission because we knew what the issues were, and now we've responded to the royal commission. Labor has done nothing!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services (Senator Colbeck) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have seen in question time after question time, our national Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Senator Colbeck, refuses to take any responsibility for the dire plight of senior Australians who are trapped in aged care in appalling circumstances, in incident after incident. It is leaving my home state of Western Australia incredibly scared of what it might mean when and if COVID actually arrives in the state. We have seen from this minister such abject unaccountability that it beggars belief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the minister in question time today simply point the finger back at the dysfunctional companies that are failing to uphold standards. He is responsible for the regulator. The government is responsible for aged care. He simply pointed the finger back at the Jeta Gardens aged-care home and said it was their responsibility to improve their standards. Well, sure it is, but look at how dysfunctional it is; look at the abject lack of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have senior Australians in pain with injuries, jumping out of windows and breaking their legs because there is only one nurse to administer pain medication. Is it any wonder that this poor woman was left for 3½ hours? Is it any wonder that she threw herself off a third-floor balcony and broke her bones in multiple places. The incident report demonstrates that neglect was a contributing factor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the minister who has refused to allow aged-care workers and pensioners to keep up with the cost of living, refusing to acknowledge the impact of the high rate of CPI here in Australia—the high rate of that consumer price index inflation and the impact it has on pensioners and, indeed, aged-care workers, who, in some cases, might earn as little as $1,400 a week. It is utterly appalling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have here a government that refuses to take responsibility for the plight of people in aged care. At Jeta Gardens, which was talked about in question time today, one resident has been locked in their room. He is 85 years old, with dementia. He's disoriented and, legitimately, thinks he has been abandoned. The aged-care home has not been communicating with his family. Jeta Gardens resident Ruth hadn't seen her family since December. Her family didn't know she had COVID until she was on her deathbed. They were robbed of the opportunity to spend time with her in her final days. I cannot begin to imagine what is going on on the frontline and how upset not only families and residents are but also how upset staff are. They are doing this work in our aged-care homes right around Australia and doing it with absolutely inadequate wages—inadequate wages that, according to the aged-care royal commission, contribute to the lack of staff and the lack of retention of staff. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I thank Senator Pratt for raising this very important issue of aged care and our government's commitment to aged care. Senator Pratt said our government refuses to address the issues in aged care, which is patently wrong. It was our government that set up the aged-care royal commission; our government that accepted the final report of the royal commission, which had 148 recommendations; our government that has accepted or accepted in principle 142 of the 148 recommendations; and it was under our government, that, as at January 2022, 135 of those recommendations are being addressed, either wholly or in part. We have already implemented measures within the aged-care reform package in the 2021-22 budget context and, subsequently, through the MYEFO process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a five-year implementation plan underpinned by five pillars. We are improving the home-care packages, which support our senior Australians who choose to remain in their homes. We know that so many of our senior Australians want that choice; they want to be able to stay at home, retain their dignity and be close to their friends and family. We are improving and simplifying residential aged-care services and access, so that it is easier to access for those who have to go into a residential aged-care facility. We're improving the quality and safety monitoring of aged-care facilities, and are supporting growing a better-skilled workforce. We have measures in place, and we have new legislation for stronger governance principles through that process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, throughout COVID, our aged-care workers have gone above and beyond their usual requirements. We know that the aged-care workforce has been front and centre, under the spotlight, during this pandemic, and we know that the aged-care environment is very vulnerable to the various waves of COVID. But that's why, instead of refusing to address it—as Senator Pratt has alleged—we have from the outset put measures in place to help our aged-care community respond to the challenges that COVID puts in front of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since August last year, we have had rapid antigen tests at the point of care being used within aged-care facilities—first as a trial and then rolled out more broadly. That underpinned the process of moving to rapid antigen tests at home. From our National Medical Stockpile, we made sure that there were masks, gowns, gloves, goggles, face shields, hand sanitiser and other PPE provided to aged-care sector facilities. Our Defence Force is providing strategic and logistical support to the aged-care sector. From the very outset, from the first case of COVID within an aged-care facility, we set up a surge workforce. To date, more than 80,000 shifts have been filled by this surge workforce when our aged-care staff have been isolated due to getting COVID or being a close contact. Across the country, 100 per cent of our aged-care facilities have received a booster clinic. More than 76 per cent of eligible aged-care residents have now received their booster shot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have remained flexible and adaptive throughout COVID, while still remaining focused on our commitment and our response to the aged-care royal commission. This government is delivering once-in-a-generation change through our response to the royal commission and through $18.3 billion of support for aged-care sector reform.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  I rise to take note of questions asked by Senators Sheldon, Walsh, Watt and Grogan of the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services. It's interesting listening to the previous senators speak about the royal commission. There always seems to be a lapse in memory. The only reason the royal commission into aged care came about was the pressure that was applied to this government, time and time again, by those of us on this side of the chamber. It was a royal commission that you did not wish to take part in, or even to establish, until there was political pressure to do the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the same in this context as well. We shouldn't be surprised that this minister cannot answer a basic question about the impact of cost-of-living increases on senior Australians. This is, after all, a minister who'd rather be at the cricket than working on solving the crisis in his portfolio—the crisis affecting our elders, our parents and our grandparents. The Australian Bureau of Statistics published data back on 2 February that said aged pensioners were experiencing higher cost-of-living increases. More than a week ago, the ABS published findings that annual increases in living costs in the December quarter ranged between 2.6 per cent for employee households and 3.4 per cent for aged-pensioner households—and food makes up a high proportion of overall expenditure, especially for our elders. What we have consistently said in this chamber, time and time again, is: take accountability. Take responsibility. This minister has failed time and time again to do those things. People have died under his watch—hundreds of people. His inability to stand before this Senate and face that accountability is reprehensible. He should resign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people in our communities in the Northern Territory who still do not have the RATs that they should have. Our aged-care centres do not have the resourcing that they should have in terms of staffing. Our elders across those regions need this parliament to do the right thing in protecting and caring for the vulnerable. You said that from day one you would care for the vulnerable in our country and you have failed. You have totally failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

This amendment would require a minimum of 20 participants to go through the trial phase before proceeding to the clinical stage of mitochondrial donation. I repeat that nothing in this amendment would delay or prevent Australian parents from accessing mitochondrial services. The bill, if amended, would still immediately allow the trial processes to occur, including the full suite of mitochondrial donation processes through to live birth, so parents can go through that process. The intention of this amendment is to ensure there is a sufficiently large amount of data such that we can have information about the risks of this revolutionary and novel technique before proceeding to provide it in a wider clinical fashion, where there will be much less oversight and involvement of researchers on a day-to-day basis as per the trial phase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a simple amendment. It provides some protection for us as legislators in that there'll be sufficient information before the minister, who will make regulations to go to the clinical phase. As discussed last night, some senators here would have preferred if we had required legislation to come back to this place before we could proceed to the clinical phase, that we did not delegate that power to the minister, but those amendments have not been proceeded with. This is a sensible approach that would still allow the minister the delegated power to proceed to the clinical stage, but after 20 participants go through the trial.</span>

Many of the amendments have been aimed at providing more oversight from this place, in this institution. I'm obviously disappointed that we have chosen not to strengthen our arm in providing more oversight but instead leave it effectively to the scientific community to make these decisions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am intending here to move another set of amendments which would not really provide much oversight or monitoring but would at least provide to us some more information on what is occurring in these trials than what is currently prescribed in this bill. The bill, as amended in the House—and I do give credit again, as I did in the second reading speech, to Mr Kevin Andrews. He and others pushed for some more reporting, and I thank the government for agreeing to those amendments and providing some additional reporting than what was there originally. However, the reporting that is there now on a six monthly basis does not have to prescribe any particular information, so there are no guarantees that this will include details of how many trials have occurred, how many participants have gone through those trials, how many have been approved, whether or not there have been adverse events associated with the donation techniques or even what types of donation techniques have been used, and we'll come to those later in other amendments. I don't think it's appropriate that, for something as novel and revolutionary as this, it should ultimately be up to the people that are regulating this area what information they provide us—and I use that with a lower case 'r' as they're not a regulator exactly; they're overseeing this area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure here that the regulators do provide the information so we can assess what's going on. This is really important, because we've seen from the UK experience there hasn't been a lot of information provided about what's going on. In the UK, they legalised mitochondrial donation techniques in 2015. We have extremely limited information from the UK about the outcomes of the donations that have occurred to date or at least that people have been going through them. We don't even know if mitochondrial donation has occurred in any real sense. We know that I think 20—maybe 21—participants have been approved to proceed through the process and there have been eight, apparently, who have actually received some services. But, as I say, we're not sure of the content of those or what has occurred or the outcomes. To my mind, it is completely inadequate that after almost seven or eight years now we have not received information on the barest of details about what is occurring in the UK. It's an issue here for us. It was an issue in the Senate inquiry that I participated in that there wasn't a lot of detail about exactly how these revolutionary techniques have been used in the one jurisdiction in the world where they are legalised.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I and some other colleagues thought through this, we thought that we should actually try to specify, as a parliament, at least some minimum information that should be in reports. We have decided annual reports are fine. As I mentioned, the government had decided on six-monthly reports, but, given the slow pace of these technologies overseas, we didn't think six-monthly reports were absolutely necessary. So an annual report would be fine, but we do think it should require some minimum information that can provide people with an oversight of what is occurring and how these are being developed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The details of this amendment are not restrictive—more information can be provided than what is outlined here. But, as I say, we are just seeking a bare minimum of information that should be provided. In that information, we would like to see the number and kinds of mitochondrial donation licences that have been issued under section 28J of the act. We would like to see the reporting include the outcome of the activities of each licence issued under that same section, including in this information the number of births of children as a result of pregnancies achieved by mitochondrial donation techniques. Additionally we would like to see the number of any adverse events notified to the licensing committee under a specific paragraph in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't see these amendments as being at all controversial. They should not be controversial. It should be a basic requirement for the reports to include this kind of information. As I say, there seems to be a risk that we may not get this type of information given the experience of the United Kingdom over the past seven or eight years. I'm sure we will hear other speakers say, 'We don't need this because it will be provided anyway,' but I'm a little bit concerned that may not occur given what has happened in the UK.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a broader point here, too, that goes harking back to the arguments we have been making. We have effectively established a system, through rejecting other amendments, of self-regulation for gene therapy research here in Australia or at least a precedent of that, in this case, on the mitochondrial donation techniques. The only regulation oversight of the mitochondrial donation techniques will be done by the organisation that is commissioning and funding the research in this field. That is self-regulation. The people at the NHMRC are great people, intelligent people, but they are directly involved in the research itself and they are being asked under this bill to regulate themselves, to be the only people actually overseeing what is occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to make the point sometime in the debate, because I've noticed that the debate in this place has evolved over the past day, that a number of speakers have seemingly suggested that scientists are somewhat of an infallible species among us, that we don't need to question or oversee the work of scientists because they are very intelligent, know what they are doing and can be trusted. Some of those things are true. No doubt scientists are extremely intelligent. No doubt the successes of science are things we can learn great lessons from. No doubt the successes of science are things we have all benefited from in some way. But to suggest there are no risks involved with scientific research blinds you to the history of scientific development among the world and, indeed, the history that we are living through today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, we still don't exactly know where the coronavirus came from, but we are absolutely sure that the relationship standards and oversight of research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were definitely deficient. There were issues. Perhaps the coronavirus itself and this whole pandemic came from that lab and deficiencies associated with that the lab. We had a situation where we only learnt after the event that our own researchers at the CSIRO were cooperating with and training researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology on coronaviruses in bats. They were doing that. It's all come out since. They were regulating themselves and deciding this themselves. There wasn't any oversight of this. It is a bit complex, of course, and we didn't know about it. Ministers I have spoken to didn't know about it. We know now, from evidence in this place and other work by journalists like Sharri Markson, that our own CSIRO, a great organisation, with really great people, trained Shi Zhengli, the so-called bat lady, at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. They collected samples of coronaviruses in bats here in Australia and helped Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists work out how to identify which coronaviruses would be more effective in infecting human cells. They provided human stem cells to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to do further work on coronaviruses in bats. That all happened here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's before you get to what happened over in the United States with their scientific organisations, which seemingly had an even stronger and closer relationship with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, including funding people that did work there. We have all seen the potential cover-up that has occurred since. The complete lack of oversight over those processes may have caused the deaths of millions of people around the world and untold economic damage to almost every country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need some oversight of what is occurring here. This is a bare minimum. It's just asking for some specific data. It is common sense, and it will not in any way stop or prevent mitochondrial donation techniques occurring. I ask the Senate to approve this amendment.</span>

So it's been very clearly established that there is to be frequency and even on-demand, where required, reporting arrangements put in place. Others have noted the role that the NHMRC has in relation to accountability to the parliament through estimates and other vehicles as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason as to why I discourage support for this is that, as well as it potentially being duplicative and confusing, it runs the risk of undermining some of the privacy considerations that are clear. This amendment would remove the provisions that ensure that reports that are provided do not identify any person or are not capable reasonably of being used to identify any person. Clearly those privacy considerations are important, and so I would urge the Senate to support the existing quite comprehensive reporting arrangements.</span>

This amendment, I accept, on the surface seeks to increase transparency, but the risk is that it does the very opposite. Under Australia's Privacy Act any information provided about a cohort of less than 10 people, even if de-identified, does not achieve anonymity and therefore is not permitted. As a result, in the event that there are fewer than 10 live births in any given year, instead of receiving more information, as is suggested by the amendment, no report would be able to be tabled at all. So, again, I encourage senators to vote against this amendment.</span>

I just would like to place firmly on the record that this is a workplace and that people are entitled to a safe workplace here. And part of a safe workplace is—for people who may have health issues which would lead to extremely serious consequences for them if they were to contract coronavirus—that it should be enforced that senators in this place, unless they are on their feet speaking, should wear a mask. It's just common courtesy, apart from anything else, but it is also essential to provide a safe workplace for other senators.</span>

                    </a>  I will try again. The amendments previously moved related to regulation, oversight and accountability. I wanted to move the discussion on to a different part of the bill: the techniques of mitochondrial donation that are permitted by this bill. I need to set up a little bit, for my arguments, a brief explanation of those techniques. There are five that are outlined in this bill. Broadly speaking, as is clear in the explanatory memorandum, those five techniques can be divided into two different types.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One type, including the pronuclear transfer method and the second polar body transfer method, relates to making the mitochondrial donation after the fertilisation of two different eggs. In that situation, two eggs are provided: one from the expectant mother and one from the donor mother. Sperm, of course, are provided from the father, and those two eggs are fertilised. Once that fertilisation occurs, a zygote—personally, I would refer to it as an embryo, but the bill refers to it as a zygote—is formed and mitochondria are transferred between the two fertilised eggs at that stage. Following that process, one of those zygotes, or embryos, is discarded before the other embryo is implanted through normal IVF techniques, hopefully for a live birth. That's one type of those techniques, which include the second polar body transfer and the pronuclear transfer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other type of techniques—most commonly the maternal spindle transfer method—makes the mitochondrial donation before the fertilisation of the eggs. In the same way, two eggs are harvested, from the expectant mother and the donor mother. The mitochondrial transfer occurs at that stage. One of those eggs is then discarded, and the other egg proceeds to be fertilised, there's the creation of the zygote and there's implantation through IVF, and a live birth, hopefully, ensues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was outlined in the second reading speech, some view these two different types of techniques as having quite different ethical implications. In the first type of technique—most commonly the pronuclear transfer technique—there is the creation of an embryo, or a zygote, for the sole purpose of being used as an instrument to help another life, another embryo, and it is then destroyed. That particular life, as I would call it—but if others want to call it a zygote, then that particular zygote—has no potential, no plan and no possibility of becoming a life in and of itself. It is created only for the purposes of trying to improve, in this case, the life of another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of us have ethical issues with the potential of using one life as an instrument or tool to help save other lives. Of course, this occurs at a very early stage of life, but, as was outlined in the second reading speech, there's no scientific distinction between the conception or creation of a zygote and other stages of life. No discontinuity has been identified by science such that at that point, this is something and, at the other point, this is something else. All the chromosomes and all the potential for life are there at conception; once conception occurs, it is, potentially, a viable life under the appropriate nurture and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of my colleagues, in discussing these issues, have said it would be better at the trial stage to start with the techniques that have fewer ethical implications and fewer concerns for many Australians. So, in a second, I will move amendments on sheet 1518 which seek to simply remove those two techniques—the pronuclear transfer technique and the second polar body transfer technique—that would of necessity involve the destruction, in my view, of a life. I know from discussions I've had with others around these issues that there is a view that removing those types would limit, and possibly obstruct, the development of mitochondrial donation techniques; however, I do not think that accords with the evidence. Some have even put the case that it's pronuclear transfer and the embryonic transfer of mitochondria that have shown more success and that, therefore, we must keep that in the bill, because there are only limited possibilities of the egg transfer method—the maternal spindle transfer method—being successful. I don't think that accords with the evidence at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in this debate, when the government and others have put forward their support of this bill, a lot of the time it's been very much through an assertion of certain facts, like the one I just provided: that maternal spindle transfer is somehow a failed technique or uncertain and may not work. In fact, a report released very recently in a medical journal called <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics</span>, titled 'The regulation of mitochondrial replacement techniques around the world', looked at all the different techniques around the world, including pronuclear transfer and maternal spindle transfer, and the regulatory environments around the world. As has been discussed, only the UK has specifically legalised mitochondrial donation techniques. But the report identified that, around the world, there had actually been three births from using the techniques outlined in this bill, although they were not always used for mitochondrial donation. There have apparently been live births, according to these scientists, in Mexico, in Greece and in Ukraine, in the past four or five years. Two of those three live births involved the use of maternal spindle transfer techniques—the technique involving the transfer of genetic material at the egg stage. Only one of the three used the pronuclear transfer technique. The government and proponents of this bill are saying the pronuclear transfer technique must be included because it's the only way we can do it, or the most prospective way we can do it. Well, that's not the evidence around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should say for full information that, of those three live births, only one was from mitochondrial donation. That was the birth in Mexico. In the case in Greece—which was done with Spanish scientists—and in the case in Ukraine, the genetic transfer techniques were actually used to overcome infertility issues in the mother—that is, the same techniques were used to transfer genetic material to correct for infertility defects. Others have referred to this in the debate: the only live birth that actually occurred to overcome mitochondrial disease occurred in Mexico, and that was using a technique that involved the transfer of material between eggs, not embryos. That technique, according to this article, was a maternal spindle transfer. It was the technique that the amendments I'll move propose to leave in this bill, leaving it possible to start research and trials with that technique.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that, given the revolutionary and novel techniques we are legalising here, we should start with those techniques that have been the most prospective and raised the fewest ethical issues and we should see how that goes first. The government or others could always come back and seek to legalise the other techniques if maternal spindle transfer—the egg transfer technique—does not prove viable. Again, while these amendments go a little bit further than what many other senators have proposed previously, they do not in any way stop the progression of the development of mitochondrial techniques. They just seek to prioritise the development of those techniques that have been proven so far to be the most successful—or, at least, the ones that have been most used—and that clearly have fewer ethical issues. Wherever you fall on this balance, there are fewer ethical questions with the transfer of mitochondria at the egg stage compared to the embryonic stage.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of t</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">he Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise in support of Senator Canavan's amendments. I will not repeat the arguments he has put about the differences between pronuclear transfer and second polar body transfer. I will simply make the observation that one process, pronuclear transfer, involves the creation of two distinct human embryos, one of which will be destroyed, and the other process, second polar body transfer, does not. It does not require the creation of two distinct human embryos, one of which will be destroyed. What I would like to do with this contribution here is to address this very moral and ethical—and scientific—question about what value we should attach to a human embryo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying this, I reflect that the human embryo has moved out of the womb and into the petri dish. This is not something I am opposed to—techniques like IVF have assisted families to have children—but it has raised some significant moral, scientific and legal questions. Thirty years ago, when an embryo could only reside in a uterus, stockpiling them in laboratories was inconceivable. Harvesting bits and pieces from them was unbelievable. Buying and selling them was unimaginable. Where we are today is truly a brave new world, and it does require us, and has required us, as parliamentarians to think carefully about these things. This parliament—in 2002 and again in 2006—and state parliaments have considered these issues, and they continue to do so. I do want to address this issue of why I think it matters that a human embryo does deserve our consideration and our legal protection. In doing so, I recognise I'm going to get into some slightly vexed ethical and moral issues, so please bear with me. I think it's important that we tease these out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that we understand that every single human embryo has a new genetic code. It is a code that has never been seen before and will never be seen again. It is a distinct human being. I don't think a human embryo is a human person that attracts all the legal rights of personhood, but nor do I think it is just a collection of cells like those cells we might find in our skin or our hair. It is something different, and I do think it deserves respect. I do think it deserves some legal protection. I certainly do think we should think very carefully about normalising a situation where human life can be viewed through a utilitarian lens—that is, that we can create a distinct new human life for the purpose of harvesting parts from it and destroying it. We need to think about this carefully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not being partisan, but I'm simply drawing on a quote from Prime Minister John Howard when, in a previous debate, he said, 'I have been personally unable to find a huge moral distinction between allowing the human embryo to succumb as a result of exposure to room temperature'—as sometimes happens in IVF—'or ending it through research.' I've heard other people make that point, and I think it's a legitimate point to make. Here's why I think there is a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intention of creating the embryo does matter. When you create embryos in IVF, you create them for the purpose of trying to bring a new life into existence. Just as when you conceive naturally not all of those embryos survive to birth—and it is the case that creating embryos for the purpose of IVF is to bring a new life into existence—yes, some of the embryos created by IVF may well not survive.</span>

                    </a>  They may never get used; that is true, Senator Pratt. But that doesn't make it right to use those embryos that are surplus, or create new embryos, simply to harvest something from them and destroy them. It is a utilitarian view of human life. I say to the chamber: imagine if we applied that approach in other circumstances. What if we were able to cure Parkinson's disease by harvesting brain cells from comatose people or severely disabled people, whose lives we might say aren't viable or productive? We would react in horror to that. I would hope we would. So we don't do that. For many Australians—and I am one of them—the idea of creating a new human embryo simply to harvest something from it and then destroy it is a step down a slippery slope that I don't want to take. There are many Australians who share that point of view. That's why we have conscience votes like the one we are having now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made this speech, or versions of it, in previous parliaments when similar bills have been debated that go to the use of human embryos. What I often find is afterwards I get accused of being anti abortion. So I'm going to take a moment or two and speak to this. Let me be clear: human life is not simple or straightforward. As I said earlier, I don't think a human embryo at its embryonic stage is a full human person deserving of all the legal rights that a person has, but nor do I think it is nothing. I can't align myself 100 per cent with the pro-choice movement, with those people who think there is no consideration we should give. And I can't align myself 100 per cent with the pro-life movement either, with those who think that we cannot ever allow an abortion to happen. I take the approach that former US President Bill Clinton took: abortion should be safe, legal and rare. I take the view that, in an ideal world, contraception would be more readily available through the Medicare system to young women and young men and the use of abortion in terms of contraception would be reduced. That is my personal view, and it's what I would support in a policy sense. I want to put that on the record lest some people seek to take my remarks here tonight about human embryos and twist those remarks or use them in another context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a deeply important issue we are considering here. I am actually hopeful. I'm encouraged by the number of senators who have expressed concerns about this bill, because I think we are rushing into a brave new world here. Not only are we asking this parliament to legalise a technique that alters the make-up of human beings at its most significant level—its DNA level—but also, unless we support these amendments, we are legalising and giving a tick to the creation of a distinct new human life, which has never been seen before and will never be seen again, solely for the purpose of harvesting something from it and destroying it. I ask those people who say it is just a bunch of cells to reflect on that very fact. We are introducing a utilitarian approach to human life. We are saying that unless a life is viable it is not one that deserves our respect and support. I don't make those comments lightly. This is a deeply held conviction that I bring to this debate, and I ask people to consider it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan has observed that these amendments do not stop the progress for those people who want to see mitochondrial donation progress; they merely remove an ethically and morally problematic process from the legislation. In that sense, I think they improve the legislation. In that sense, I think the parliament would be wise, given the novel and, indeed, revolutionary process that we are being asked to legalise, to take a conservative approach—not the Left/Right kind of conservative but, rather, the most risk-averse approach. I will be supporting Senator Canavan's amendments.</span>

One is that when this debate first started I had the opportunity to engage with the Mito Foundation and a number of other experts to try to understand this legislation. I absolutely understand the intent behind it and I support the intent behind it, which is to alleviate suffering and to use research to alleviate suffering. I think we should look for all reasonable and ethical measures that we possibly can to that end, so I commend those great scientists who engage in that type of work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to associate myself with some of the comments we've heard from Senator Keneally and Senator Canavan in support of these particular amendments. I think that these amendments would alleviate one of the worst and most morally problematic parts of this bill—that is, that the bill currently allows the creation of a human life for the purposes of using it for research which, inherently, means its destruction. That is a massive ethical line that we are on the verge of crossing in this country through this legislation, where for the first time we would be allowing the creation of a human life specifically for the purpose of destroying it in research. We haven't done that in the past. We didn't do that, in fact, even when it came to stem cell research, and we had a lengthy debate in relation to that. We were told that embryonic stem cells had the most potential; it turned out that, actually, adult stem cells delivered great potential and we have seen great scientific advances without those ethical concerns. I think we are crossing a really serious line, and it's not one I support, but I support these amendments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is where we sit tonight. This law, opening the gateway to vital medical research, that has been subject to debate in the chamber, is now about to come to a close without resolution because of the previous decisions of this chamber in relation to the organisation of the business of this place. I seek, in moving this motion today, not to constrain any senator in making a contribution to what is a conscience vote. I seek simply to move to allow the time necessary for that debate to conclude and for a vote on the legislation finally to be taken before the Senate rises at the end of this parliamentary day. Let us not have a situation where this law passes because we have run out of time, when it is totally within the powers of this chamber to grant ourselves additional time to consider this legislation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion, if moved, would grant an additional half an hour of time to debate. That is plenty of time to get through the three remaining amendments and vote finally on the law as it would then stand, giving clarity and certainty to all of those in this debate who are concerned by this issue. There are many other matters before the chamber; however, I would note that our colleagues in the House sat until two o'clock in the morning yesterday debating an issue of legislation. Let us not leave any impression that we are not willing to sit and do our jobs to get legislation important to our communities through this place. So let us stay here in this debate, let us finish what we have started and let us give certainty and clarity to all those concerned by the outcome of this legislation. I commend—no, I beseech the chamber to allow this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-Presid</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">ent of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I deeply wish to see this legislation pass. The government provided government business time for legislation that is receiving a conscience vote. We listed it as the first item of government business on Tuesday and provided all of the government business time available on Tuesday for its consideration. We, with the cooperation of the chamber, also provided additional time on Tuesday night for the Senate to continue its consideration of this bill. We then also provided extended sitting hours through negotiation with other parties last night for consideration of the bill and, of course, listed it as the first item of government business and, again through negotiation with other parties, provided additional time this afternoon for debate in what would otherwise ordinarily have been general business debating time. I want to acknowledge that there has been cooperation across the chamber to provide additional time for debate of this bill. I don't want to cast any aspersions on any individuals that have contributed at various lengths to the bill. I have certainly tried to keep my contributions as short and sharp as possible to keep things moving. Noting that I think it is unlikely that the extra half an hour you propose, Senator Steele-John, would have enabled all of the remaining amendments to be considered and debated in the way in which such sensitive topics should be handled for the conclusion of the bill, I would provide the commitment that we will seek to manage the program in the next sitting week in a way that provides sufficient time to try to conclude this matter. I hope that we will receive sufficient cooperation around the chamber to be able to do that in terms of giving up some of the other parts of the business or enabling additional hours, as you say, at a time when it is possible for individuals to do so.</span>

I am committed, and many others are committed, to seeing this bill come into law, but I am also committed, on what is a highly sensitive topic with serious ethical and moral considerations for individuals around the chamber that cross party lines, to ensuring that, as with previous conscience votes on matters of this nature, people have all the time they need to be able to thoroughly ventilate their concerns on the issues that are raised in a manner befitting proper parliamentary debate.</span>

I think that that is a tone that has been set by Senator Birmingham in his handling of the legislation, and so I thank him for that. I think the debate has been conducted respectfully, carefully and thoughtfully and it has recognised that people come to a conscience vote with strong views on both sides, formed by their ethical convictions, their work experience, their own research, their consultation with their constituents and the like. Therefore, the respectful tone of that is acknowledged.</span>

On that basis, and in consideration of the lateness of the hour, the sensitivity of the bill, the necessity to ensure people can participate fully in the debate and the necessity for this chamber to pass other legislation, including the appropriations bills, as well as legislation that is required prior to the election, we will be supporting the government in their approach to this motion.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate and Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  When we were debating the Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021 late last year, I was making the point that this bill is the latest attempt to capitalise on the COVID pandemic for political purposes—in this particular case, to capitalise on the COVID pandemic for the sake of the rich and the powerful by making permanent the temporary dispensation from having to hold in-person AGMs that was previously granted to companies. Can I just be clear that the Australian Greens, as I said last year, absolutely accept that this measure was necessary during the period of extended lockdowns, and we also continue to support making permanent the capacity for companies to hold hybrid AGMs. But we do not support the provisions in this bill that would allow companies to hold wholly virtual AGMs, because annual general meetings are among the few occasions when big corporations have to account for themselves publicly. They are an opportunity for investors to scrutinise what is actually being done with their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pursuit of profit under the laissez-faire, neoliberal, late-stage disaster capitalist system that we find ourselves living in relies on those who run corporations being able to abstract themselves from the human or ecological cost of their actions, and that is why the executive class finds AGMs so uncomfortable. The billionaires and their lackeys hate having to face the public, because they hate being held to account and they hate having to answer uncomfortable questions, which is precisely, of course, why companies—listed companies in particular—should be required to continue to hold in-person annual general meetings, either as standalone meetings or as hybrid virtual meetings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given all of the power and wealth concentrated in their hands, and given the public responsibility associated with being publicly listed, the least that the captains of industry and finance should be expected to do is to face the music once a year and allow themselves to be held to account for their actions. But this government doesn't want that, because—let's face it—this government is here for the big corporations. This government is here for the billionaires and their lackeys. This government is here for its political donors. How do we know that? Because this government takes millions of dollars in donations from the big fossil fuel companies, as, in fact, does the Australian Labor Party. That's why neither of the major parties in this place is proposing to take action on climate change that is anywhere near in line with what the science is telling us we need to do if we want to avoid catastrophe and calamity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Virtual AGMs may well provide greater accessibility for a greater number of shareholders and greater public transparency at some point in the future, but the point is that right now neither the technology nor the governance arrangements are in place to ensure this. The committee inquiry into this bill heard detailed accounts of the problems with virtual AGMs conducted during the period of temporary dispensation as a result of the pandemic. The bill has, of course, failed to address the issues flagged during that inquiry, yet it has made the leap to allowing companies to hold wholly virtual AGMs. This is nothing other than a naked ploy to give corporate Australia a chance to recalibrate standards around accountability and transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let no-one make the mistake of thinking this bill exists in a vacuum—because it doesn't exist in a vacuum. It sits alongside the government's watering down of continuous disclosure laws. It sits alongside the regulations that the government attempted to put through this place to cancel the licences of proxy advisers. And can I say what a great show it was by the Senate earlier today to disallow that move by the government and disallow that naked attempt to cancel the licence of proxy advisers, who do such a great job in making sure the market can be informed by accurate information. This bill sits alongside the latest attempt to use the pandemic as cover to consolidate the power of the tycoons at the expense of mum-and-dad shareholders, whom the Liberal Party once made a virtue of representing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Allowing hybrid AGMs should be the limit of current reforms. To that extent, I will move the amendment on sheet 1472 circulated in my name. This amendment would prevent listed companies from holding wholly virtual AGMs. It's been revised to align it with the amendments agreed to in the House to establish a review into these provisions of the bill. By their nature, listed companies have a public responsibility and the parliament should ensure that their AGMs are conducted in a publicly observable manner. Allowing listed companies to hold hybrid AGMs will provide an opportunity for all of the issues associated with virtual meetings to be sorted out and for there to be a real-world confirmation of their purported benefits. Until then, wholly virtual AGMs for listed companies should not be allowed and shareholders should retain the opportunity to sit in the same room as the executive and the board to bear witness to exactly what they are up to and have the capacity to hold them to account for their actions.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I rise to make a few brief remarks about the Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021. Whilst I support choice in the ability to hold these AGMs in a hybrid model, to have that virtual participation and that in-person participation—it was something which we saw happen during the pandemic and I note that those arrangements have been extended through this bill—when we are looking at this legislation I think it is worth reflecting on the impact the pandemic has had on people who struggle to participate virtually for reasons which are very much beyond their control. We know things like the regional divide and accessibility to high-quality broadband affect people's ability to participate in person. We know that, during the pandemic, for these individuals, participation not just in AGMs but in all sorts of the key economic opportunities in life have been impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, the limitations of our National Broadband Network have made it very difficult for people in regional areas to participate in education when education went online and very difficult to participate in virtual health when that went online during the pandemic. The pandemic has raised many questions about digital access—that is, the need for all Australians to have access to high-quality, reliable, fast broadband internet, which they do not have at the moment. In many parts of regional South Australia, many South Australians are struggling with access to internet. It is causing barriers not just socially but economically for these individuals in regional South Australia. When we're looking at issues like those contained in this bill, I would urge the Senate to consider the other ways in which we can prioritise the needs of regional Australians or those who have difficulty accessing the tools they need to participate online—whether it be in health, education or in instances like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a lot of critical and urgent issues during the pandemic for government to deal with, but I think one of the key lessons it has shown us is that it's incredibly important for people to have access to technology and to have access to the internet, and, even when they have access, to be able to use it and to know how to use it. Many elderly Australians may be able to access broadband internet but may not be comfortable using smartphones or the other pieces of technology required to unlock its potential and its benefits. I just wanted to make that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the opportunity to be able to review these arrangements. I appreciate why choice would be important. But I just draw the Senate's attention to those issues, particularly for Australians in regional areas.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  [by video link] Can I first say to Senator McKim that I'm a great supporter of profit and a trenchant critic of losses. I think the pursuit of profit is quite a noble ambition, and we shouldn't disregard the point that our great enterprises across this country provide growth, jobs and opportunities for all sorts of people. I come at this from a totally different philosophical background to Senator McKim, which should surprise no-one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim did not refer to any of the many checks and balances that are contained in this bill, the Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021. Let me go through some of them. There can only be a wholly virtual meeting if it is provided for in the constitution of a company. That means one of two things: either that, when someone becomes a shareholder of the company, the constitution of the company provides for a virtual meeting or that, when someone is a shareholder, the constitution of a company is amended to permit only virtual meetings. That can only occur if a special resolution is passed, and a special resolution requires at least 75 per cent of the votes cast on a resolution in favour of the amendment to the constitution. That is an extraordinarily strong check and balance. I would expect that, and I think there have been examples where, companies who have been considering amendments to their constitutions to allow for only virtual AGMs will find that many stakeholders—including those companies with large retail shareholder bases—will be against amending their constitutions, and that those amendments to the constitutions simply won't proceed. I think in many cases there will be checks and balances through the constitutions of the companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to make is that the bill provides that there must be a reasonable opportunity for shareholders to participate in the annual general meetings of companies. Whilst some stakeholders have raised concerns, and some practical examples with respect to how that has worked in practice during this COVID pandemic period, most companies have worked well with their share registry service providers and others to ensure that shareholders have that reasonable opportunity to participate in AGMs where those AGMs are conducted on a virtual basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got the check and balance in terms of the constitution; the constitution of the company must provide for virtual-only AGMs. Secondly we've got the check and balance with respect to providing a reasonable opportunity for all shareholders to participate in the AGM, to ask questions of the board and the senior executive team—as they should be entitled to in an AGM context—and also to make observations, raise concerns and ask questions of the auditor. Whoever is there at the AGM has the opportunity, through the AGM, to ask those questions and raise those concerns. That's the second check and balance. The third check and balance is there is going to be a review of this legislation and how it has worked in practice after two years. That's the third limb of the protections which are contained in the proposed amendment to the Corporations Act in this bill. When we look at those checks and balances in their totality, and when you look at what has actually happened in practice over the course of the COVID pandemic and how corporate Australia has responded positively in terms of making sure that its shareholders have an opportunity to participate in annual general meetings, that should give us all a great deal of comfort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say in response to the comments raised by Senator Marielle Smith—and I think they were earnestly made—with respect to the participation of shareholders in a regional context: prior to companies providing hybrid AGMs, regional shareholders were even more disadvantaged because they would have had to travel large distances in order to physically participate in annual general meetings. So I think these reforms should be looked at in a global context, and it should be acknowledged that shareholders actually have more opportunity to participate in AGMs where the information technology is provided to allow them to participate in virtual AGMs. In fact, more shareholders would be able to participate than used to be the case at purely physical AGMs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, as someone who served as a company secretary of an ASX-listed public company, I want to say that I think many companies—and certainly most companies in the ASX 100, which are the top-listed public companies—will recognise the benefit of having a physical AGM in addition to a virtual AGM. I can well remember during the height of the global financial crisis how much it meant to the senior executive team of the company I worked for to actually have physical AGMs where we had an opportunity to liaise with our retail shareholders who supported us through those very, very difficult times. I remember a few of my favourite retail shareholders, Albert and Sam—and I must find them, so I can convey to them that I've referred to them in this debate—and I recall some of the fine points they made at many of the AGMs that we held during those difficult times. There certainly is a place for physical AGMs, and I suspect that most companies which have large retail shareholder bases will continue to have them, but companies should have the choice. For some companies that struggle even to establish quorum at a physical AGM, giving them the power to conduct a wholly virtual AGM will actually provide a powerful driver towards achieving economy and saving costs for their shareholders. That shouldn't be forgotten either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that shouldn't be forgotten is that this bill contains other reforms. There are very important reforms in relation to the execution of documents, so that those can be done in technology-neutral ways. There are also important reforms in relation to the conduct of polls, so that most important resolutions that are put before shareholder meetings and AGMs will have to be determined by poll. In addition to that, those shareholders who represent at least five per cent of the total shareholder base would also have the right to be able to call for the involvement of an independent expert or an independent conduct of the poll to make sure it's being done in the correct way. That is certainly a reform which is supported by the proxy advisers who Senator McKim refers to as being a positive development in terms of corporate governance practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does more than just deal with virtual AGMs. Insofar as it deals with virtual AGMs, I provide my 100 per cent support. I think it's a welcome initiative. There are checks and balances through the constitutional provisions, through the two-year review and through the reasonable opportunity for shareholders to ask questions and make observations, but the bill also provides important reforms with respect to the execution of documents in technology-neutral ways and also through the conduct of polls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those comments, I'm very, very happy to commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Qu</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">eensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I speak to the Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021. The process of bringing corporate governance into the digital age has proven problematic for the Morrison-Joyce government. This was not because the issues involved in this bill were too complicated for the good folk over on the government benches. The real culprit in dragging out this issue for more than two years is the Treasury who, we know, is the real government in Australia. Once again, Treasury could not help itself in constructing measures to serve the interests of the big end of town over the interests of everyday Australian shareholders, and it came unstuck—the Treasury came unstuck.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that I've been trying to sort out since the first reports of the failure of virtual AGMs came into my office in October 2020. In September 2020, Treasury introduced the Corporations (Coronavirus Economic Response) Determination (No. 3) 2020. It allowed any company to run a virtual AGM, as well as providing for some measures regarding electronic filing. That determination was enthusiastically embraced by the big end of town. It proceeded to run roughshod over the entire concept of shareholder primacy and accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the usual suspects were there, rorting away. Bendigo Bank limited questions to an online forum that allowed only 500 characters for a question. That's little longer than a tweet, making it almost impossible to ask a sensible question. Maybe that was their objective. Activist shareholders were excluded from the virtual meeting room by way of being sent incorrect logins for the meeting. The emergency assistance number did not answer. Bendigo Bank did write their own Dorothy Dixer questions—which were not correctly referenced to a shareholder by name, of course, for obvious reasons. Were all shareholder questions asked? Who would know? There was no public transcript of the AGM made available, although a full transcript was available for a fee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not to be outdone, Crown casino pulled their own stunts, including changing the wording of questions that were too embarrassing for Crown. They combined the same questions from different shareholders—except they were not the same. Hard questions were grouped with a softball question, and only the softball question was asked. They would read a question but then advise that the answer would only be given in a private conversation with the shareholder. What! The meeting was then guillotined, and remote attendees were given seconds to vote, ensuring proxies decided the vote in favour of the guillotine. This sounds like Labor and the Liberals running the Senate!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The year after that AGM, Crown's operations were described by a royal commission as 'disgraceful', and, 'illegal, dishonest, unethical and exploitative'. As a result, one of Crown's casino licences was placed under supervision, their largest shareholder was told to unload its shareholding, and at one point Crown's share price was off almost 50 per cent—people didn't trust them. Those Crown shareholders who were deliberately and systematically disenfranchised by the directors' deceit at the AGM lost money because Crown ran their AGM as a damage control exercise. That cannot happen if the shareholders are in the same room as the directors. If shareholders had been allowed to ask their hard questions and to hold the board to account, would the meltdown of Crown in the year that followed still have occurred? It's an interesting question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why AGMs matter. That's why shareholder primacy matters, and accountability to shareholders above all else. Who will invest money in publicly listed companies if the directors can make a joke of the one opportunity shareholders have to control how their money is invested by their company or, worse, if shareholders know their money is being misused and are not then given a chance to do something about it? It's disgraceful, dishonest, unethical and immoral. Treasury's attempt to relieve its big business mates of the troublesome scrutiny of these pesky shareholders who own their companies risked undermining the very concept of a publicly traded corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the circus that virtual AGMs became, the government enshrined the same provisions in the Treasury Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Bill 2021, which was passed only after One Nation and others in the Senate forced the government to sunset the bill on 31 March 2022—that is next month. If the Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021 is not passed in this sitting, then the measures sunset and the original provisions of the Corporations Act regarding AGMs and document filing come back into force. This is not something One Nation wanted to see. To be fair, the government has constructed a bill which went a long way towards correcting their original skulduggery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is actually a well written bill, but One Nation is still concerned this bill contains the same provisions for registered corporations to hold 100 per cent virtual AGMs—entirely virtual. The Treasury tried to cover that up. The explanatory memorandum to the Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021 includes this passage:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes permanent changes allowing companies and registered schemes to hold hybrid meetings (which give shareholders the option of either attending in person or remotely) …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On page 18, which explains the provision for virtual AGMs, the section is headed: 'Hybrid meetings of shareholders of a company or registered scheme'. Then it says, right there in its own document, that registered companies can hold 100 per cent virtual AGMs—not hybrid, virtual! Did Treasury think no senator or stakeholder would read the bill and discover the provisions for virtual AGMs for registered corporations still lurking in there? Is this planned? Is it deliberate deceit? That's enough of the spin, enough of explanatory memorandums being written by the marketing department. How about some honesty?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate inquiry, the Property Council of Australia stated that while they supported the bill they remained concerned that, subject to a constitution change, even public corporations could vote to hold 100 per cent virtual AGMs. The Australian Shareholders' Association has called on AGMs to remain hybrid—not 100 per cent virtual—and highlighted the same failings that I raised with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission at estimates in March 2021. The submission by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility also opposed 100 per cent virtual AGMs in these terms:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">thereby avoiding any in-person, transparent interactions with shareholders. This is not in the interests of shareholders or public companies …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is certainly no obvious case to justify allowing companies to do away with physical meetings … altogether.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation agrees. We want transparency. We want accountability. We want scrutiny. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors pointed out that some companies changed their constitutions during the pandemic to allow virtual AGMs and that the wordings of those resolutions would count as a constitution change under the bill. That means that companies could run virtual AGMs straightaway with no further vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A second rort the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors found was in IPOs. If the initial constitution passed to create a new company included virtual AGM provisions, then those would be in place from the start, and, again, the shareholders would be disenfranchised with no opportunity to vote against virtual AGMs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim has submitted amendment 1472 revised, which removes the right of a listed corporation to hold a 100 per cent virtual AGM. I thank Senator McKim for proposing that amendment, and One Nation is in support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at the rest of the bill, the Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021 enables electronic execution and witnessing of legal documents to be made permanent and consistent across Australian jurisdictions. This is not an AGM related provision. For instance, it would allow for execution and witnessing of deeds electronically. The document-handling sections of this bill were supported by the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, CPA Australia, the Law Council and the Governance Institute of Australia, amongst others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, One Nation supports this bill. However, we remind the government that we will be voting against the bill because of our principle of voting for freedom. We want the government to restore basic freedoms not only to the people who are protesting out the front here right now but also to people right around Australia who are being penalised with inhuman, immoral and ridiculous, unscientific vaccine mandates and other forms of coercion and restrictions. We will be voting against this.</span>

I'd also like to thank the Senate Economic Legislation Committee for their inquiry into and report on this bill. The Corporations Amendment (Meetings and Documents) Bill 2021 modernises the Corporations Act 2001 and the Corporations Regulations 2001 to allow for the use of technology to meet regulatory requirements. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, companies and registered schemes will be able to hold meetings physically, as a hybrid, or, if permitted by the entity's constitution, as a wholly virtual meeting. Members will have the flexibility and the choice to receive documents electronically or in hard copy. Finally, the bill allows for documents to be validly executed in flexible and technology-neutral ways, including electronic or wet ink signatures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will conduct a 12-month opt-in review of annual general meetings, or AGMs. The aim of the review will be to encourage companies and shareholders to engage with technology with a view to considering whether future permanent reforms are needed to further support companies to effectively use technology to engage with their members. A review of the legislation will also be conducted and tabled in parliament by the first sitting day of each house, following the 30-month period after the day the bill commences. The review will be undertaken by an expert panel consisting of at least one member with experience in corporate governance and the role of company directors; experience in representing the interests of shareholder rights; and experience in advocating for corporate social responsibility. These reforms will support companies and registered schemes to effectively use technology to engage with their members and provide regulatory settings to support Australia's economic recovery plan. In its report tabled on 18 November 2021 the Senate Economics Legislation Committee recommended that the bill be passed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to address here the two other recommendations that are made in that report. The Labor senators recommended an independent review of the bill, conducted within two years of its implementation date. The bill includes a requirement to review and report on the operation of these amendments at the earliest practical time, two years after the commencement of the provisions. The Australian Greens senators recommended that the provision allowing for entities to conduct wholly virtual AGMs be opposed. The bill gives entities and members the flexibility to hold meetings in the format that best suits them. The bill allows entities to continue to hold physical meetings and makes permanent the ability to hold hybrid meetings. An entity may only hold a wholly virtual meeting if it is expressly permitted by the entity's constitution, and this gives members the right to consciously decide whether wholly virtual meetings should be permitted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We made further amendments to the bill to ensure that if a review is not conducted and tabled in parliament, provisions of the bill that allow for wholly virtual meetings will cease to have effect. Additionally, if there are any recommendations from the review, a written government response will be required and tabled in parliament no later than three months after the report is tabled. The bill also preserves members' rights to participate in meetings by requiring that virtual-meeting technology be reasonable and facilitate the ability of the members to ask questions and make comments both orally and in writing. For these reasons, and on the recommendation of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, I commend this bill to the Senate. </span>

The government has agreed to this amendment. But we recognise that the substantial benefits that can come from virtual AGMs include improving the ability of Australians in remote and regional areas to participate in corporate governance, and so we won't stand in the way of this. But we will ensure that shareholder rights are protected through the independent review process that we have secured in the other place.</span>

The bill contains a legislative requirement for a review to be undertaken within two years after its commencement, and government parliamentary amendments introduced in the House of Representatives ensure that those wholly-virtual meetings provisions will cease to have effect if the review is not done and a report is not tabled in parliament 2½ years after the act's commencement. For this reason, the government will be opposing the Greens amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Millions of Australian parents and grandparents have proudly watched their daughters' and granddaughters' sporting achievements: playing their first game, winning their first trophy, making their first state team, or signing their first professional contract.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet under recent interpretations of Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</span> (the Act), sporting codes, clubs and volunteers can have legal action taken against them for offering single-sex women's sport. This interpretation has been used as a weapon to pressure sporting organisations to allow males to play women's sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The need to separate females and males on the sporting field—in the vast majority of sports—has been understood for decades. It is evident in the fact that men's world records on the track and in the pool are significantly faster. It is evident in the fact that many male high school athletes can record faster times than female Olympic finalists. It is evident in the fact that male players can punch harder, serve quicker, jump higher, and impart more force in a tackle or collision. A male athlete—regardless of their gender identity or skill level in their sport—has access to male physical attributes and development that female competitors do not. The insertion of these male attributes into a category of sport specifically designed to exclude them is unfair to female competitors, in the same way that it is unfair for a heavyweight to compete in a lightweight boxing division or an adult to compete in a junior competition. In many sports it is also unsafe. The need for specific single-sex sport for women remains just as strong today as it did when previous generations of women fought to establish women's sporting competitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill provides a simple clarification of a principle which has been embedded in the Act for decades—that offering single-sex sport should not be grounds for a complaint of discrimination under the Act. An exemption has always existed in the Act providing that it is lawful to discriminate on the ground of sex in relation to competitive sport. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The principle that single-sex female sport is a necessary and important category which should not be unlawful continues to be relevant today, and always will be relevant. However, following changes made to the Act in 2013 and particularly in light of guidance on interpretation of the Act issued by Sport Australia and the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) in 2019, there is a clear need for clarification and simplification of provisions which were intended to ensure that the operation of single-sex sport is not unlawful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The uncertainty of how and when the sports exemption in the Act can be applied is well documented. The Coalition of Major Professional and Participation Sports was forced to seek clarity on the operation of the Act from Sport Australia in 2018. Sport Australia, despite being the peak body for sport in Australia, was unable to provide clear advice and asked the AHRC for assistance. The 50-page guidance document issued by AHRC and the Sport Australia states that "The Guidelines do not provide a definitive legal answer to all of the issues if discrimination, harassment or victimisation that may arise under the Act. Organisations and individuals should seek their own legal advice if they have concerns regarding their compliance with the Act…". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Guidelines go on to suggest a seven step process that sporting organisations should go through before seeking to exclude a male from a women's sporting event, including consulting with the relevant national sporting organisation, consulting the relevant player association and providing the individual with an opportunity to seek a review of a decision to exclude them. These are unwieldy and unworkable expectations for many local and grassroots sporting clubs, competitions and volunteers who, under this interpretation of the Act, are exposed to legal action for offering single-sex sport for women and girls. Local sporting clubs around the country often exist on wafer-thin budgets with barely enough resources to purchase equipment and maintain facilities. The prospect of these clubs and their volunteer committees having to fight a legal case in order to offer single-sex women's sport is entirely unreasonable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In these circumstances, sporting codes are effectively prevented by Commonwealth law from implementing a clear, upfront rule providing that their women's competitions are single-sex. The default position under the current interpretation of the Act is that it is unlawful to exclude males from women's sport, with the onus placed on administrators to prove that an exemption applies each and every time a male seeks to compete in their women's competition. Female players and athletes therefore have no certainty that despite having registered for a women's competition, they will not be required to compete against males.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To add to the confusion, the AHRC/Sport Australia guideline advises that "sport should be based on a person's affirmed gender identity and not the sex they were assigned at birth". This statement is directly at odds with both the function of women's sport—which is to provide separate competition for females—and with the intention of the sporting exemption in section 42 of the Act to make clear that offering single-sex sport for women is a legitimate and lawful aim. The inclusion of advice that sport should be based on a person's gender identity rather than their sex in a document described by the AHRC as "legal guidance on the operation of the SDA" serves to emphasise to Australian sporting administrators and participants that they may be subject to legal action for offering single-sex sport for women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 'case-by-case' assessment model required by the current interpretation of the sports exemption within the Act presents multiple problems, not least that it positions women's sport as a mixed-sex category to which males can gain entry by claiming a degree of mediocrity. Other protected categories of sport—such as junior sport—are not expected to operate in this way, and there would be a public outcry if they were. Even if it was agreed that using women's sport to match female athletes against male athletes whose attributes fall within a certain range is desirable, experts and authorities including the UK Sports Councils have observed that case-by-case assessment for male inclusion into women's sport "is unlikely to be practical nor verifiable". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The requirement, suggested by current interpretations of the Act<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>to undertake case-by-case assessments places unfair pressure on local sports administrators to make complex judgements on when the law would consider that a male can "effectively compete" in women's sport, in the knowledge that they can have legal action taken against them if they determine that it would not be fair for the male person to be included in women's competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill removes those problems by clarifying that sport and sporting activity can be operated on the basis of sex and it will not be a breach of the Act to do so. By removing a series of complexities from the current decision-making process, sporting administrators will be able to have confidence that they are permitted by Commonwealth law to offer single-sex sport for women, which in turn will provide female athletes the certainty that they won't be forced to compete against males. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This clarification will ensure that the law cannot be used as a weapon to pressure sporting clubs to accept males into women's sport. It achieves this without restricting the ability of sporting bodies to offer a range of competition and participation options. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Bill, a sporting competition could choose to offer, for example, single-sex women's sport, 'Open' divisions available to everyone regardless of sex or gender identity, and a range of social options including mixed-sex social sport. In this way, the necessary and important category of single-sex women's sport will be maintained and protected while there will be options for everyone to play sport regardless of their gender identity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, by passing this Bill, the Parliament will send a clear message that single-sex sport for females is encouraged in Australia, just as it has been for decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further provisions in the Bill will reinforce Australia's commitment to women's single-sex sport by adding support for women's single-sex sport to the functions and objects of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Sports</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Commission Act 1989, </span>and adding support for the provision of single-sex sports, facilities and services which promote the welfare and safe participation of women and girls to the objects of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</span>.</span>

Acting swiftly to eradicate these exotic pests and diseases whenever possible avoids the significant cost to our producers of managing them if they establish here. This joint interest has seen governments and industry bodies partner as signatories to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement and Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the last two years, government and industry, using these arrangements, were together able to eradicate citrus canker, Varroa mite (which is a bee parasite) and three strains of avian influenza.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Industry investment in biosecurity is most often funded through four kinds of biosecurity levies. These levies provide an equitable way for all producers to contribute to the cost of biosecurity activities and eradication responses that benefit their industry. Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia levies fund, for example, activities such as biosecurity education, planning and surveillance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Emergency Animal Disease Response and Emergency Plant Pest Response levies primarily fund industry contributions to eradication responses. They can also be spent on other biosecurity activities once these financial obligations are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An issue for PHA member industries is that for the EPPR levy this alternative use is limited to purposes related to emergency plant pests under the plant response deed. Increasing the flexibility in how these levies can be spent will increase their effectiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will achieve this by broadening the range of permissible uses for these levies. Plant industries have welcomed this change, as it will allow them to focus available funds on their industry's most pressing biosecurity needs. However, meeting response costs remains crucialit is the main purpose for emergency response leviesand the bill will not change that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is just one way the bill will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of biosecurity levy funding arrangements. It will also modernise and streamline the AHA and PHA funding legislation, including by removing redundant or duplicative provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, a complex provision for funding biosecurity related research and development activities through PHA levies will be removed in favour of using PHA's more straightforward industry planning processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will also simplify the process by which the relevant PHA industry member for a specific biosecurity levy is determined. This will reduce regulatory and administrative burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Honey bees provide valuable pollination services to a myriad of plant industries and the honey industry's biosecurity activities are now characterised as plant biosecurity. Therefore, references to honey in the AHA act can now be removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will also allow the AHA act to facilitate the key arrangements that are likely to be needed if other response deeds are agreed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes by the bill will each contribute to making the AHA and PHA funding acts more effective, efficient and fit for purpose. This will help maintain Australia's enviable position as a first-class agricultural producer and exporter.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill ensures people can't be persecuted for moderately expressing a reasonable belief—what could be fairer than that?—whether that belief is motivated by—or indeed, critical of—a religion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, the bill draws a clear line against harassment, vilification or intimidation of anyone. Religious faith should always be expressed in love.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill recognises that religious schools must be free to uphold the tenets of their faith and the ethos that makes their school a community. It is recognition of the sacrifices parents make to educate their children in accordance with their values and beliefs and the choices they have made for their children's education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill protects the fundamental right for religious schools to hire religious staff to maintain their religious ethos in accordance with a publicly available policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The approach detailed in this bill provides certainty to school communities and to the staff they employ through the development of policies that are transparent to the school community. It's only fair.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nothing in this bill—I stress: nothing—allows for any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of sexuality or gender identity. You won't find anything of that nature in this bill. Such discrimination has no place in our education system.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The protections in this bill affirm the generous, openhearted and accepting culture that is embodied in much of our national life.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, we believe it is important that what has been treated as a culturally accepted norm should be better codified in law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly, every age faces its share of bigotry against people of faith. The Treasurer and his colleagues sadly know too much about this in their own personal lives and in their own communities. I particularly acknowledge all</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">those of the Jewish faith. It is a great shame that the Treasurer of our country has to be offered close personal protection not because he is the Treasurer but because he is a Jew.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The values of 'tolerance' and 'diversity' have been appropriated against Protestant Christians, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Mormons, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Baha'is, Sikhs and so many more religions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sectarian divide that dominated almost the first two centuries of European settlement in Australia is testament to that. Catholics and Protestants. Thankfully now a thing of the past; we worship freely together and openly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Equally, that sectarian divide is a reminder that people of faith too have a responsibility to treat others as they themselves seek to be treated—another great principle and teaching of faith.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Still, many people from various religious traditions are concerned about the lack of religious protection against the prevalence of cancel culture in Australian life. It's true. It's there. It's real.</span>

Accordingly, the commission will be required to refer complaints regarding the conduct of Australia's intelligence agencies to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and to refer complaints relating to discriminatory industrial instruments to the Fair Work Commission. This reflects the current approach under existing federal antidiscrimination law.</span>
