                  </a>  We've waited a couple of weeks to get an answer on the question of who signed Brittany Higgins's rapist into the building. This is after the rape that is alleged to have occurred in Minister Reynolds's office. We've waited those two weeks and we've had this response which you've just now tabled, which says you think it might be privileged information and you're going to send it to a confidential committee to advise on whether that's the case and how to proceed. Well, it looks an awful lot like sweeping this under the carpet and sending it to a committee that is not conducted in public and that presumably can't be spoken about publicly. I also question the fact that advice will be sought from the Clerk. Well, you could have asked the Clerk for advice a couple of weeks ago, and we all could have benefited from the response to that advice. I'm concerned at the lack of transparency that will now be associated with this process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also asked some questions about the event that the alleged rapist was in the building to attend. Those questions didn't pertain at all to who signed him in. They in no way concern privileged information and should have been answered. I acknowledge you've said you've still got a couple of weeks to respond to those, and I really look forward to the answer to those questions, because, at this point in time, people not only want to know that their workplaces are safe around the country but they want to know that everything is being done in this workplace to keep young female workers, and all workers, safe. I'm very concerned that this process is now being sent to a confidential committee. The Greens will participate in it, but it feels deeply inappropriate to send this off with no date for when a resolution will occur and with limited ability for this to be then publicly spoken about. I really don't think this is going to go down well, and we will continue to seek answers to these questions of who signed the rapist into the building.</span>

We have to respect that the Presiding Officers are bound by decisions made through the various procedures of the parliament and do need to act in accordance with those. The government has sought and will continue to seek to cooperate as fully and as expeditiously as possible in terms of information requested. When you first asked these questions, we provided a swift response, with the cooperation of the Presiding Officers, in relation to whether or not a pass had been issued. That was capable of being done within the rules that were established, noting that the technology and records in relation to the allocation of passes enabled a swift answer to be provided.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The manual and physical process of signing individuals in is obviously governed through different arrangements, but it also creates additional difficulties in terms of physically ascertaining that information. I'm not aware that there's any particular information that says the individual has ever been signed in. The government will continue to cooperate as best we possibly can through all of these processes to get swift answers to these matters, but I would stress that to date we have provided as much information as is actually available in relation to passes and access, and will continue to do so where we can.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  Senator Waters, I wasn't aware that you were going to make those particular comments that, in my view, unfairly impugn my motives or actions over the last few weeks. When you have asked questions, those answers have been provided. This statement was drafted in response to a specific question that was raised in the other place. I've consulted with you privately and given you the courtesy of explaining the approach we were taking over the last two weeks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This involves matters under the administration of both houses; it's not something that I can do unilaterally. I am advised that the committee to which it is being sent is the appropriate committee to first look at this matter. That is set up by this Senate; it is not a committee set up by me. I operate under the rules that this entire Senate imposes on me. I might also say that I think it is only appropriate, after this decision was reached by the Speaker and myself, that we seek advice from the Clerk and, in my case, the Clerk of the Senate. I think it would be inappropriate of me to make such determinations without seeking such advice and providing it to the committee which, as you said, you are free to participate in. That is one of the reasons that it is the appropriate committee.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the question on notice you have asked: we are still within the window and, as I indicated to you privately, I am seeking to answer that question. I will do so in consultation with the advice that the committee receives from the Clerk. But I do reject the motives or implications that you said in your statement then, given that, at all times with respect to your questions, I think I've acted in good faith towards you and the questions you have asked.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:37</span>):  Last week, I attended rallies in Townsville and Cairns with workers who are against this Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021. I told those workers that I would come in here and vote against this legislation because it does nothing to help our recovery, it does nothing to support jobs and it does nothing to fix insecurity in work, which we know this government talks a lot about but doesn't do anything about when it comes to the crunch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those rallies took place outside the member for Herbert's office and the member for Leichhardt's office, but we weren't able to get straight answers from either member of parliament about whether they would guarantee that no workers would be worse off under this legislation. The member for Leichhardt didn't even front the media after this rally was held. Workers had to go all the way to his office to be heard and they still had no answers from this government or the member for Leichhardt about why this legislation is being pushed through at a time when regional economies are facing an economic crisis, with JobKeeper being pulled out. It doesn't make any sense. Just because words are put in the title of legislation doesn't mean that it's what that legislation delivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst part about this legislation—and I will go through the provisions in a moment—is that we know the government are using COVID as an opportunity to attack workers' rights. It says a lot about the government and their priorities. The workers who got us through this crisis are now the workers the Morrison government want to attack—the cleaners, the retail workers, the transport and dock workers. The people who kept the country moving in the middle of a pandemic are the people now being attacked by this government. It says a lot about them. They were in here thanking those workers, posting things on Facebook, thanking people for going out there, doing their jobs and keeping the country moving, but now this is how they thank those workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does a number of things to undermine the working conditions of Australian workers. It cuts workers' pay by changing the hours, and overtime power is given to employers instead of workers. It does this by introducing what they say is a modest change to have, by agreement, part-time workers work extra hours without getting overtime. They say that if the employer and employee come together and decide that this is a good thing to do then what's the harm in that? The Liberals will tell you that there is a level-playing field between employees and employers when it comes to making this agreement, but we know that is not true. Individual workplace agreements were the cornerstone of Work Choices. Maybe members of this government don't know what it is like to have an individual workplace agreement slid across the table and for you to have no other option but to sign that agreement. Well, I know what that feels like. When John Howard was here, when Work Choices was in, when this government was trashing workers' rights, that is what happened to me as a young worker: an individual workplace agreement. I didn't have another choice. I didn't have a choice to sign another agreement or to push back; I needed a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So many people are now in that situation. They are desperate for work, desperate for hours. This government is putting through a system that means that part-time workers will receive less take home pay, because they won't be able to get overtime. Their employer will slide an individual workplace agreement—that's what it is; they might want to call it a different name now, but that's what this is—across the table. And they can't say no to signing that agreement; otherwise, they probably won't have a job. They won't get the hours that they need. We know how this works. This government doesn't talk to workers. They don't understand what happens in workplaces, so they don't understand how this will play out when it comes to workplaces in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals will tell you the other thing this legislation does is create a pathway to permanency. They like that term: a 'pathway to permanency'. What it doesn't do is actually give workers a right to permanency. We know that there are two Federal Court cases at the moment that say you can't keep a worker as a casual forever. If you do, you will have to pay them all of the entitlements that you didn't pay them when they were a casual. It's a pretty simple concept. That's why workers, supported by the CFMMEU mining division, took these cases to the Federal Court. This government joined the Federal Court case not on the side of workers but to support the company to stop these cases going forward. They lost that bid; they lost these cases. The Federal Court ruled in favour of the workers to stop them becoming permanent casuals. So what has this government done? It's bringing legislation forward to overturn those decisions. That's what this government is doing. The Liberal and National parties will tell you that all they're doing is just cleaning up the definition of 'casual', but what they've done is overturn those Federal Court cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of this government have been out in Central Queensland and North Queensland telling people that this legislation will provide a pathway to permanency, but where is the enforcement? If a case goes to arbitration then an employer can decide not to take part in that arbitration. There is no enforcement mechanism. It is all smoke and mirrors from this government. For all of the time that Senator Canavan, that the member for Dawson, George Christensen, and that members of this government have been telling people in Far North Queensland, regional Queensland and Central Queensland, 'We are going to do something about dodgy labour hire, about the problems with casualisation in the mining industry'—here is their chance, and what do they do? They put forward a haphazard overturn of Federal Court cases that will do nothing to help workers in Central Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also contains eight-year greenfields agreements, so no negotiation can take place between workers and employers for eight years. We heard evidence at Senate inquiries that greenfields agreements have locked in what workers call suicide rosters. They haven't been able to negotiate that. After four years, right now they can go and negotiate those rosters. They can go and negotiate the terms and agreements. Things change in a workplace when there is no project. For years, as a project progresses, those workers invest their hard work and time in getting that project off the ground, and this government will remove the opportunity for them to negotiate for eight years. There are not many projects that take eight years to complete, so this means workers on these greenfields agreements will never get to negotiate their workplace conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is bringing forward legislation that it says will improve wage theft laws, that will make wage theft laws better in this country. But we know that the Labor state government in Queensland has already brought in workplace wage theft laws. Those wage theft laws make sure that the penalty for stealing from a worker is the same as the penalty for someone stealing from their boss. There is an equivalency. That's an important part of those laws. But this legislation from this Liberal-National government is watering down Queensland's wage theft laws by not delivering the same level of penalties for employers. That's not good enough for Queensland workers. That is why they rallied outside the offices of LNP members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is not in this bill says a lot about this government. There is no policy in this bill that if you work the same job you get the same pay. If you work the same job, you should get the same pay. If we had laws that delivered that, then dodgy labour hire would not be able to undermine the working conditions of people in our country—people working in regional Queensland on dodgy labour hire agreements that undercut their hard-fought working conditions. Labour hire companies have been able to undercut these working conditions so that people are now not able to plan for their future. They don't know when they're going to be able to take a holiday with their family. They are being paid less than the person standing next to them doing the exact same job. This is an opportunity for the government to fix this problem, but they're not doing that through this bill. It says a lot about them that they're pushing through this legislation but not doing anything to make sure that if you do the same job you get the same pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation doesn't do anything to stop permanent casuals or continuing short-term contracts. It doesn't provide a way for wages to increase by bargaining better. It doesn't fix that problem. When it comes to IR legislation and making changes, it doesn't provide things like 10 days domestic violence leave. The government is making industrial relation legislation changes, but it left that one out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that I have left, the other thing that is deeply concerning about this bill is it makes work more insecure. It means workers won't be able to plan for their future. It means they will be paid less. It means work in this country will be, as they refer to it, more flexible, but we know that when they say 'flexible' they really mean 'insecure'. And this is at a time when the government is also cutting JobKeeper, taking off the table support for communities, jobs and workers around this country. The problem with that is that the government's plan to rebuild the economy is to let workers do it themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment said of the recovery plan the government is delivering that Australians had to 'dig deep' and resist the urge to be 'stingy' when booking a holiday at home. Mr Tehan said that he encouraged Australians not to 'be tight', to spend the same way they do overseas. He said there should be 'no penny pinching in Australia this year'. At the same time as the Morrison government is asking Australians to spend their own money to save jobs in tourism, it's pushing through legislation that makes work less secure. At the same time as the Morrison government is cutting JobKeeper, it's pushing through laws to make jobs less secure. At the same time as thousands of workers risk losing their jobs, the Morrison government is pushing through dodgy IR legislation. At the same time as thousands of workers in Cairns and around the country are concerned that they will lose their job because the government's only plan to support workers is to ask other Australians not to penny pinch, this is the legislation that the government is pushing through. This is their plan for recovery: to cut workers' rights; to make it harder for workers to get a secure, well-paid job; to make sure that the rights and conditions hard-won through Federal Court cases in this country are overturned. That is their plan. Do you think it's going to work? The Morrison government's Liberal National Party member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, said that cutting penalty rates would create jobs. Do you remember that one, Madam Deputy President? They said, 'If we cut penalty rates we'll create more jobs.' It didn't create a single one. Cutting penalty rates didn't create a single job, and this legislation will not save or create a single job.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  It's disappointing that we find ourselves standing here in the Senate chamber today, at the end of a very difficult 12 months for Australians, who've been doing their bit to get through a pandemic, dealing with a piece of legislation, the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021, which proposes the most drastic changes to our industrial relations system in over a decade. It's no coincidence that this is coming in the recovery phase—we hope—of a pandemic. It's just like the way the government has used COVID to push its agenda, or the agenda of its donors, for a fossil fuel led recovery, the 'gas led recovery'. I and many senators have sat on the COVID committee hearings over many months and we've witnessed this cynical use of a pandemic to say: 'Hey, we need a COVID recovery. Jobs are important, the economy's under assault; let's do this.' They've used it to push their agendas. Today is another example of an agenda, which they just can't let go, to do whatever they can to undermine workers' rights—to come into this place and work for their special interests, the big business sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is especially disappointing because two things we can reflect on from COVID over last 12 months are how it relates to workers' rights and how we operate in this place. Firstly can I say that it gave me, as a senator, a lot of hope during the first phase of COVID, when we were all in lockdown and working from our homes, to see political parties come together and unions and business advocacy groups come together to put in place a stimulus package that helped both businesses, especially small businesses, and workers. Of course, that was the JobKeeper program. It wasn't perfect. Not enough people got it. The Greens pushed hard for those who were unfairly or unnecessarily, through mean-spirited politics, left out of JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind my colleagues across the chamber that the Greens were the first to be campaigning and calling for a living wage during the pandemic. We worked hard to speak to stakeholders to try to get everybody on board, as I am sure the Labor Party did. To your credit, you did listen. It took a few weeks for you to get on board but eventually you did listen to the business sector, the unions and other political parties in here, and we got a good result for Australians. I don't think any of us can deny that JobKeeper and certainly an increase in JobSeeker, which we would like to see made permanent, has helped every state economy and our national economy. It has helped small businesses stay in business. It has given workers the certainty they have needed during this very difficult period. So where has that spirit of cooperation gone, where everybody is working for the public interest? Where has that spirit of cooperation gone? It's especially damning that it's back to cynical self-interested politics so early. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that COVID laid bare just how bad and how big a problem insecure work is in this country. Many of us probably felt the frustrations. It wasn't just state premiers or the Prime Minister who felt frustrated when we saw outbreaks from hotel quarantine. But we learned that those hotel workers who had spread COVID, which led to more shutdowns, were working two or three jobs. They were out there because of insecure work. They had to do two or three jobs to put food on the table. If that's not an indictment of just how bad insecure work in this country is, I don't know what is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have before us today is a cynical attempt to use the COVID recovery period, under the guise of 'we need jobs and growth'—just the name of the bill tells you that: the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021—to say: 'Forget about these concerns that workers, unions and some in the small business sector have about this bill. What's more important is that we have jobs and recovery during a pandemic.' If anything, it should be the other way around. The pandemic should be an opportunity for us to press reset for the next 20, 30 or 50 years. We should use this as an opportunity to get things right—to maintain a higher level of JobSeeker to give people fairness and dignity in their life, and review this concept of a living wage that has so helped so many Australians. That money has been circulated through the economy. The circular flow of income has worked. It has kept certainty in our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reaction we are seeing right around the country to the removal of JobKeeper tells you something very important. People aren't confident, without government stimulus, of the economic landscape, both here and overseas, in the next nine to 12 months. While government regulations are in place, while the government are dictating border closures and restrictions for business and restrictions on international travel—and, may I say, restrictions that are totally necessary—they have a role to play and a responsibility to look after small business and workers. It has worked very well in the last 12 months. But here we have, before us today, an attempt to lock in insecure work. I'm going to go through my key problems with this bill in a moment, but it's worth pointing out that over two million people in Australia are unemployed or underemployed, with women, young people and migrant workers particularly bearing the brunt of this statistic. Instead of improving job security and lifting wages—which, as the Reserve Bank governor continues to remind us, is absolutely necessary if we're going to have a future recovery—the government's pushing for a bill that will further entrench insecure work, suppress wages, give more power to businesses at workers' expense and undermine the role of unions. It is more of the same, more of what I and other senators in this chamber have seen every day in this place since the government came to power in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've mentioned that the pandemic has highlighted inequality that's been allowed to flourish as a result of the push by this government for insecure work over many, many years. Casual workers were hit the hardest during the pandemic, accounting for approximately two-thirds of people who lost their job when the pandemic hit just over a year ago. Those casuals who still had a job were amongst the lowest-paid and most insecure workers, with no access to paid leave entitlements. And we mustn't forget the role insecure work played in spreading COVID across the country as workers without paid sick leave were forced to choose between their health and their income. I once again remind senators of issues around quarantine outbreaks among hotel workers. Many employers have built insecure work into their business models. While they turn a profit, workers have not had a job or income security. Changes in this bill will just entrench that. Instead of passing a bill that further entrenches insecure work, reduces wages and increases the powers of employers, we need to outlaw insecure work and ensure the right of all workers to a safe, meaningful, secure job with good wages and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first issue I have with this bill is the definition of a casual. The new definition will give employers all the power to determine whether a worker is casual and will allow businesses to classify workers as casual at the start of their employment, regardless of what ends up happening after that or how many additional hours they end up working. The bill clarifies that to avoid any doubt: the question of whether a person is a casual employee is to be assessed on the basis of the offer of employment and the acceptance of that offer, not on the basis of any subsequent conduct of either party. In other words, it allows the use and abuse of casual workers, who may be required to work full-time hours but don't get any of the entitlements that go with that. I've got no problem with casual work if it's with the agreement of the worker. I've been a casual worker myself, and that has suited my personal circumstances. But without agreement and with a scant regard for workers' wellbeing it's totally unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue is casual conversion. Casual-conversion offers must be made to casuals who have been employed for 12 months unless—and I stress 'unless'—there are reasonable business grounds not to make the offer. This is unenforceable, as arbitration is available only if both parties agree, and the employer has very broad rights to refuse conversion on reasonable business grounds. Well, what does 'reasonable business grounds' mean? Does it mean the employer wants more profit? As if that's going to work and be a fair basis to make casual-conversion deliberations!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also got problems with a new class of workers, what we call 'part-time flexi'. This bill will create a new class of de facto casual workers by robbing part-time workers of hours and income security by allowing businesses to effectively treat these workers like casuals, with the power to increase and decrease their hours. The bill introduces simplified additional-hour agreements, which allow part-time workers in industries that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail, to be employed on contracts that offer a guarantee of only 16 hours a week, with their employer able to increase their hours without paying overtime. We note that penalty rates will still be paid where applicable. This applies to 12 modern awards; however, the minister will have the power to make regulations to include or exclude modern awards. If you were a worker, having seen the track record of this government in the last nine years, would you trust the minister and this government to make those decisions in your interests? I wouldn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enterprise bargaining: there is a suite of proposed changes in this bill that significantly erode workers' rights and undermine the role of unions in the enterprise-bargaining process. Time and time again, we've seen big businesses act in their own self-interest at the expense of workers' wages and conditions. However, the government is removing the safety net checks and balances that are designed to protect workers and asking them to trust big business to do the right thing. Once again, I'll remind the chamber of Philip Lowe's comments when speaking recently about the need for wages growth. What is needed, and what economists, unions and workers call for, are for policies that will increase wages. However, this government is pursuing a bill that will suppress wages as if we haven't learnt the importance of being fair and equitable during the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greenfield agreements: this bill will allow the Fair Work Commissioned to approve greenfield agreements to operate for eight years, locking workers into subpar agreements without the opportunity to renegotiate or access arbitration—eight years! That's a long time; eight years is nearly a decade. And wage theft: while the bill criminalises wage theft for systemic patterns of underpayment, which is welcomed, it doesn't apply to one-off underpayments, inadvertent mistakes or miscalculations. That needs to be fixed also.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are six or seven key things in this bill that the Greens fundamentally oppose. But, more importantly, I ask senators in this place to think about the last 12 months. Think about the spirit of cooperation that we've all worked together on in this place—something we can be proud of for the rest of our careers—helping our country to get through a difficult period. Unions were working with businesses and politicians were working across political parties to help workers, small businesses and everybody to get through the most difficult of times. That spirit of cooperation has now gone. This bill signals that. This bill is a return to business as usual: trying to screw workers, trying to help big business and supporting their donors in politics. I urge senators to reject this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  This Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021 shows what this government is willing to sacrifice for its conservative idealism, attacking workers at the expense of our economic prosperity. That's what this bill does: it takes away job security for millions of Australian workers; it delays our recovery from the pandemic by crushing wage growth; and it strips away workers' rights which, in turn, impacts on our economy. This bill sickens our economy and it certainly sickens our workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANU submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill called it an immediate threat to public health. They warned that lack of paid sick leave will exacerbate a weakness in Australia's COVID-19 response. This bill promotes insecure work and erodes the security and protections provided to employees. It allows businesses to hire employees as casuals and to deprive them of leave entitlements, even if they subsequently work a regular roster. The ANU research school's submission noted that Australia already has one of the highest rates of individuals without leave entitlements among OECD nations, with estimates ranging from 25 to 37 per cent of the workforce. And we know that casual workers are doubly impacted by the COVID pandemic due to the absence of leave entitlements and them being among some of the lowest-paid workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The public health experts cited modelling that paid leave, including for flu and other infectious diseases, can reduce workplace infections by at least 25 per cent. They argue casual workers are already at risk of infection and transmission, as we've seen this year among healthcare workers, personal care attendants, cleaners, security guards, abattoir workers, delivery workers, supermarket staff, public transport and taxi drivers, and childcare staff. We have listened to the public health experts in our response to the pandemic. This has been a big part of our success in staying safe and reducing the impacts of COVID-19 on Australians. We should be listening to the public health experts on this bill. They said very, very clearly that the proposed changes will undermine our world-class response to COVID-19 by increasing casual employment and insecure working conditions. The so-called reforms will hurt workers and hurt the economy at the exact moment that both need help the most. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe has said jobs and wages are key to Australia's recovery. But the government, as usual, isn't listening and it's getting it wrong on both sides of the jobs and wages equation, with no plans for investment on the scale that this once-in-a-generation crisis demands. The government still plans an abrupt end to income supports in a few weeks, despite pleas from workers and businesses. This bill fails every test. It makes work less secure and cuts pay. It is a fundamental attack on the very workers who got us through this pandemic. It's a fundamental attack on the very workers who campaigned so hard and so long in the past to ensure Australian workers have these rights and protections. Many of you, both in the Senate and in the other place, would have seen and spoken with so many workers' representatives who've been in Parliament House this week campaigning against this bill, telling us what harm it's going to cause them, their families, their colleagues and their workplaces. Among them are representatives from Kalkarindji in the Northern Territory, people from the from Gurindji nation, from the place of the Wave Hill walk-off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of the walk-off and land rights is tied to the history of the union movement and workers' rights in this country, and it is a significant legacy. I'd like to quote some of the speech given by Kara Keys, the then ACTU Indigenous officer, at the 50th anniversary of the Wave Hill walk-off:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a great legacy because, once the Gurindji walked off Wave Hill, the NAWU gave them their 100% support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a great legacy because the union movement nationwide galvanised around the workers and gave them great support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a great legacy because it fundamentally shifted the NAWU and other unions in the country. It showed unions that Indigenous workers were willing to fight for wage equality and it shifted unions to the role of supporting and fighting for all workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And it is a great legacy because while the trigger for the Wave Hill Walk Off was equal wages, the gun powder was the systemic racism, poor living conditions, a legislative environment which allowed for the theft of children from their families and the theft of Aboriginal people having any agency over their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Wave Hill Walk Off shifted the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Kara Keys, for reminding all Australians of that. That legacy continues, and it is fantastic to see so many First Nations union members here today in the Australian parliament. I thank each and every one of you, the union members of First Nations families from across the country who are not just in the parliament this week but around the country, working with our unions, working to improve the working conditions of all people around Australia. Your message is very clear: this bill will cause more harm to workers and it will particularly hurt casual workers. The government has ignored years of common law and overturned the recent Federal Court decisions on what it means to be a casual. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these laws if a worker agrees to be employed as a casual at the start of their employment then they remain as a casual regardless of their actual work pattern, so long as the employer employs them on the basis they make no firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work according to an agreed pattern of work. If a court finds later they are in fact a permanent then any casual loading they received will be offset against any permanent entitlements they are owed. Both the definition and offset apply retrospectively. Under the government's own figures, this involves cancelling around $39 billion in back pay that would otherwise be owed to casuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were just over 2.6 million casual workers employed in Australia in August 2019. They accounted for 24.4 per cent of all employees. Tasmania had the highest casual employee share of total employees in August 2019 at 28.3 per cent, while the Northern Territory had the lowest casual share at 21.2 per cent. That is still more than a fifth of our Northern Territory workforce, particularly in our tourism and hospitality sector. This is a sector we know has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic. Many hospitality businesses have closed or downgraded. Hundreds of hotel rooms are offline. Many workers have lost their jobs or they've had their hours reduced or have relied on JobKeeper to stay employed. Making it easier for employers to casualise jobs that would have otherwise been permanent will not assist or stabilise an industry where workers are already struggling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining and construction sectors also make up a critical part of the Northern Territory economy, creating hundreds of direct jobs and contributing in a huge way to the economy. But workers in these sectors will be hard hit by this legislation. Workers on mining and construction projects could be locked into eight-year enterprise agreements, which could actually see wages that don't keep pace with inflation. So how is this good for workers or for the wider economy? How does ensuring workers end up with less money in their pockets contribute to our economy and its recovery? The simple answer is it doesn't.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fact that too many people in this country work in low-paid, insecure employment—casuals, contractors, freelancers, labour hire workers and gig workers. These vulnerable workers, the ones who can least afford it, were hit first and hit the hardest. Rather than taking this opportunity to learn lessons from COVID-19 and dealing with the twin problems of insecure work and flatlining wages, the government's proposed new laws do exactly the opposite. This bill is bad for Northern Territory workers, it's bad for Northern Territory businesses and it is most certainly bad for our nation. It cannot be supported.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  At the outset, Labor said that we would apply a very simple test to this legislation: will it deliver decent pay and more secure jobs for Australian workers? In fact, this legislation does the exact opposite. It fails our test, and that's why we will not be supporting the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021. This bill is an attack on workers, especially the lowest paid and most insecure workers in the country. Labor have always stood up for and Labor will always stand up for the workers of Australia. We will stand up against pay cuts and job insecurity and we will stand up against this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation before us has come to us at an absolutely unprecedented time in our history. We face remarkable challenges as a result of COVID-19. COVID has seen the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. The recovery is patchy, and jobs in some sectors are still at risk. So the government's pay cuts and their attacks on job security could not come at a worse time. But one of our greatest problems—that is, low wage growth—cannot simply be blamed on the pandemic, because under this government wage growth has never been slower. The problem of low wage growth will only be made worse by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Low wages growth is bad for workers—of course it's bad for workers, who are finding it hard to make ends meet and put food on the table—but it is also bad for the economy, because right now we need people with money in their pockets and with the confidence to spend it. It seems that everyone agrees with that basic proposition—everyone except the Morrison government. We know the Reserve Bank Governor, Philip Lowe, has said on multiple occasions, so many times, that we need to get wages moving in this country. He said wage growth is absolutely fundamental to repairing the economy and lifting spending, investment and growth. The Australian economy desperately needs wages to get moving right now, and so do Australian workers. But the wage-suppressing policies of this government are hurting workers and putting a brake on the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that is in front of us today, make no mistake, will only make this worse. The Prime Minister is asking us to believe that cutting wages will create jobs. Where have I heard that before? The government is a repeat offender on the lie that cutting wages creates jobs—it's a lie. Cutting penalty rates did not create a single additional job in this country. Even business groups admit that. So, for Australia to recover from the pandemic, we need people with money in their pockets and with the confidence to spend it. We do not need pay cuts and even more insecure jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that today up to five million Australians have insecure work arrangements. The government's legislation will make work even less secure through an expanded employer controlled definition of 'casual labour'. Under this provision, if an employer says that you're a casual, even if you work like a permanent staff member, you'll be treated like a casual—no leave, no entitlements, no rights, no security. That is what the government is offering you with this bill. And while you could ask your employer to be made permanent after 12 long months, if they say no, well that is just the end of it: full stop. If this legislation is passed, it will hurt wage growth and it will increase job insecurity and financial uncertainty for Australian workers. It will damage the economy more broadly by hurting consumer confidence and consumer spending. Too many Australians are already in insecure jobs; too many Australians are casuals, contractors, freelancers, labour hire workers, gig economy workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the devastating consequences of this insecurity in the pandemic. We saw aged-care workers juggling two or three jobs just to make ends meet. Their insecurity, tragically, put them and the people in their care at extreme risk. Aged-care workers, like so many workers, often have jobs with no certainty of work for the next day, the next week, the next month ahead. Workers like Sherree, a veteran aged-care worker with more than 20 years' experience in the sector. Sherree is contracted to work just 16 hours a fortnight. While she consistently works above that, she is never sure exactly how many hours she's going to get from week to week. On top of her irregular hours, the pay is low in her job, so she can't convince a real estate agent to give her a lease, she can't convince a bank to give her a loan and sometimes she can't make enough money even to meet her own basic needs. Sherree wants us to vote this legislation down. She has spoken out against this legislation and, today, I stand with Sherree and I stand with all of the Australian workers who are stuck in casual jobs and in insecure jobs. We need to vote this legislation down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's legislation would increase the casualisation of jobs and insecurity for all workers. The so-called part-time flexibility arrangements turn permanent part-time workers into casuals. These measures allow the government to extend the sorts of hours Sherree works to everyone on an award—16 hours one week, 20 hours the next, 30 hours the week after that, no overtime for going above your rostered hours, no certainty of when you will be offered more hours, no security whatsoever. This is happening right at the time when we need more job security, not less. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Prime Minister took every opportunity he could find to thank an essential worker—every photo opportunity, every doorstop. But what a difference a new year makes, because this legislation is how he is thanking the workers of Australia—the hardworking, essential people who kept our country going through the pandemic. This nasty IR bill is how Prime Minister Morrison is thanking the essential workers that this year he once called heroes. This nasty IR bill contains pay cuts, it casualises work and it makes work less secure. It gives more power to employers over workers and it gives fewer rights to unions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I have a different message for Australia's essential workers, and Labor has a different message for Australia's essential workers, because we know that you turned up every day last year to do your job. We know that you turned up to deliver the parcels. We know that you turned up to put food on the shelves. We know that you turned up to take care of our elderly in aged-care facilities. We know that you turned up every day to our childcare centres. And we know that you continue to turn up every day to do your job. The Morrison government needs to do its job and turn up for you. The Morrison government needs to do its job and turn up for you and scrap this nasty IR bill. The Morrison government needs to do its job and turn up for you and tell the people of Australia, tell the workers of Australia, exactly what their plan is to get wages moving and exactly what their plan is to make their jobs more secure, because this bill is not that plan. This is a bill that will keep wages low, this is a bill that will keep jobs casual and make more jobs casual, this is a bill that will hurt people's job security, this is a bill that will hurt Australians workers and this is a bill that will hurt our economy and hurt our recovery. We fundamentally and absolutely reject this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has had nine years to answer the questions that I've asked today: How are they going to get  wages moving? How are they going to make jobs more secure? Nine long years—in that time, I have to say that I cannot think of a single thing this government has done, a single initiative this government has taken, to get wages moving. I can't think of a single thing this government has done, a single initiative this government has taken, to make our jobs in this country more secure. In nine years, I cannot think of a single thing this government has contributed to getting wages moving and making jobs more secure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing is clear today: this bill is not the answer the people of Australia are looking for. This nasty IR bill is not the answer to getting wages moving. This bill is not the answer to building more secure jobs. It's not the answer for workers struggling to put food on the table. It's not the answer for local businesses, who actually want to see people in their communities opening their wallets and having the confidence to spend; that's what local businesses want to see. This bill is not the answer for our economic recovery. It is just one more tired and nasty iteration of this government's same old ideologically-driven policies that hurt workers and unions: cutting wages; going after union bargaining rights; and calling insecurity 'flexibility', the better-sounding and more acceptable word. This is the Liberals' go-to plan. Well, enough is enough. People need good jobs. They need secure jobs they can count on, they need rights at work and they need a government that is going to look out for them and back them up. This Morrison government will never deliver what the people of Australia need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also misses the opportunity to deal with wage theft, which is a national epidemic. Wage theft robs workers of wages and entitlements, and it also robs us of tax income. It's estimated that national revenue loss due to foregone income is over $9 billion annually. Wage theft is bad for workers, bad for the economy and bad for government, but this government doesn't seem to care. If this bill passes, it will wipe out Victoria's and Queensland's stronger wage theft laws—laws that workers themselves stood up for and fought for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's bill will set an impossibly high bar for successful prosecution of wage theft offences; employers will face little prospect of prosecution and will face trivial criminal penalties if, indeed, they are caught. That's why workers like Jules fought so hard for those Victorian wage theft laws. She's a veteran hospitality worker. In her time she's seen every type of wage theft in that industry. These are her words about the stronger wage theft laws she fought for in Victoria being overturned by this bill: 'When Victoria introduced legislation criminalising wage theft, I cried. Finally, workers were going to have something solid and strong. The federal government's legislation is a kick in the guts to workers like me.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian government has said that the Commonwealth should amend its legislation to bring wage theft provisions in line with stronger Victorian offences. But instead the Morrison government will give unscrupulous employers in Victoria a free pass, and workers will find it much harder to prosecute their employers for wage theft. So the next George Calombaris, the next Rockpool, the next MasterChef who comes under scrutiny could very well get off the hook if this bill becomes law. The government is pursuing a deeply entrenched ideology in this legislation. There is clear evidence that better agreements are struck where unions are engaged in effective bargaining.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021. The Morrison government spends a great deal of time talking about the economic recovery from the pandemic. It likes to talk about reviving the manufacturing sector to reduce Australia's dependence on fragile global supply chains. In this process it asserts it is creating new skilled jobs for Australians. But so far we've seen very little evidence of the investment necessary to actually achieve those objectives. The truth is that the government does not have a plan for recovery. It only has a plan for increasing the amount of insecure work, for keeping wages growth stagnant, for doing the bidding of the top end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see outlined in this bill is the nearest thing to an agenda that this government has. It is a bill which is aimed at increasing what the employer advocates like to call flexibility. 'Flexibility is a very, very familiar word in the mouths of conservative politicians. We've come to understand what it really means of course: it's code for cutting wages, cutting working conditions, undermining job security and making it harder for workers to organise in defence of their rights. All the talk about flexibility masks the fact that increasing numbers of people are being forced into insecure, precarious work. The Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute estimates that casual jobs account for some 60 per cent of the jobs that have been created since May last year. From May to November 2020, casual employment grew by 400,000—the biggest increase in Australia's history. They have massively added to the numbers of what have already been called 'the precariat' in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In late May 2020 the International Labour Organization called for urgent and large-scale policy responses to prevent long-lasting damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly to young people. It feared that multiple shocks would lead to a lockdown generation, lacking social and human rights including the right to collective bargaining and participation. It noted that little or no social protection, including adequate unemployment and sickness benefits, accounted for these precarious conditions. What we're seeing in this government is a repudiation of that approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The initial response to COVID from the government was to spend very, very large sums of money to ensure that we did not sink too far into depression, but now we see a reversion to kind, to type. What we are seeing is a return to policy positions where the government is seeking to impose a regime of competition—the neo-Liberal settings which inform employment relations and welfare policies that are about fostering more precarious approaches to social relations in this country. We have seen this develop since the economic crisis of 2007-08 and we've seen it exacerbated throughout this last pandemic, right around the world. We've seen it happening not just in this country but across all market economies. It's not just a technological change—although some will say 'What do you expect, with the changes of digitisation?'—but a deliberate policy of conservative parties. It is a consequence of the disruption of the pandemic but it is exacerbated by the policy positions being pursued by conservative parties. These policies, when applied to the workplace, to the welfare system, to vocational education and training, maintain a pool of low-paid and mostly unemployed workers who have to compete with one another at the bottom end of the labour market. So they're able to provide reserve wage conditions to maintain suppression on the growth in real wages. Instead of stimulating growth, what we've got is a competition for jobs. That is the fundamental principle that underlies the economic theory behind the development of the precariat not just in this country but in so many other countries. It's why we see the deregulation of employment conditions; why we're seeing, under internationalisation and marketisation, the growth in casualisation; why we are seeing the reduction in social protections. It is why we're seeing this push for supply-side employment policies aimed at developing a marketing arrangement matching existing skills, rather than the development of new skills for new industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill that employer advocates would naturally support. They say it's not really a problem, because insecure work has really been much the same over the last 20 years. They say casualisation has remained about 20 per cent of the workforce. What they do not acknowledge is the rise in casualisation throughout the period starting probably even before the previous economic crisis. In 1982 casuals comprised some 13 per cent of the workforce. By 2017 they were 25 per cent of the workforce. More importantly, casual work, which has a narrow definition in terms of sick leave and other entitlements, forms only one part of 'precarious work'. Precarious work is work that's performed by workers with little economic or social security, with little control over their lives, with little control over their work environment. It includes not just casual work but work on fixed-term contracts, seasonal work and employment under labour hire contracts. According to the OECD, in 2015 Australia ranked third in the world for non-standard forms of employment. The OECD average for those forms of employment is one in three jobs, but in Australia, the OECD noted, it was 44 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us will increase competition for low-paid, precarious work, but it will not drive economic growth. It will be a further rip into the social fabric of this country. People will find it more difficult to control their economic lives and maintain the bonds that keep households and communities together. People will start to become alienated from a system that they feel no longer works for them. It will further exacerbate the tensions within society. It will undermine trust amongst citizens and between citizens and public institutions such as parliament. As a consequence of this kind of thing, in many democracies around the world we have seen the rise of far-Right populist movements. In many parts of the world, we've seen fascism in its many forms—which many said was defeated in 1945—re-emerge from the economic crisis of recent years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conservative governments in this country seem oblivious to the social and economic costs of the policies that they are pursuing. They have clung to a neoliberal approach aimed at driving down wages and placing more people in more precarious situations within our society—a goal that gives the lie to their supposed interest in economic recovery. Increasing the general wage level is the most direct means of stimulating economic growth. It's probably the most effective way of increasing people's opportunities. It's not complicated. When people on low incomes are paid more, they will spend more, and that benefits businesses and the workers they employ.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a short-sighted approach that the government is pursuing. Cutting costs is a prescription for a downward spiral in economic activity. That's what we've been locked into for quite a while. The Centre for Future Work stated in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a dramatic and lasting deceleration in wage growth took hold beginning around 2013. Wage growth fell by half, with private sector WPI plummeting to a low of around 1.8% in 2016 and 2017. … plummeting to record-lows during the COVID recession to only 1.2% … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the government keeps chipping away at everything that protects the standard of living of Australians, you might think that the government is set upon an ideological agenda of undermining the living conditions of the people of this country. You'd be right to think that, because what you're seeing in these circumstances is that people who are often self-employed, who are often engaged in informal work or casual work, have all had to face increasing economic pressures associated with a precarious way of life, and their entitlements and their protections and their employment rights have been reflected in the lower bargaining power that they enjoy and, as a result, a decline in their economic independence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's often presented to them that they are in fact more independent, because they're self-employed. In fact, their position is more and more dependent upon others. For work, they depend on a relationship with a single source, rather than a range of clients, and that's exactly what the courts of this country have found, and that's what obviously distresses the government so much. The provisions of this bill seek to overturn those court rulings. Under this bill, a worker who agrees to be employed as a casual at the start of their employment can remain casual, regardless of their actual work patterns. That requires that the employer hires them on the basis that they make 'no firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work according to an agreed pattern of work'. If a court were later to find that the worker in this position was in fact permanent, any casual loadings paid would be offset against the permanent entitlements the worker is owed. Both the definition and the offset can apply retrospectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By the government's own estimate, these changes will cancel up to $39 billion in back pay that otherwise would be paid to casuals. Under the National Employment Standards, employers are required to make a written offer of a conversion to permanent employment after 12 months if there has been a regular pattern of work for six months. But under this bill an employer faces not having to make the offer if there are no 'reasonable grounds' to do so—for example, if an employer thinks the job might not exist in another 12 months or if there has been a significant change in the hours of work. So, the 'reasonable grounds' exception is broad enough to block any transition to permanent employment. The bill offers people who are in insecure casual work a catch 22. Of course you can become a permanent employee, but there's still another reason you can't: this bill allows for an employer of a part-time employee who is working a minimum of 16 hours a week to agree to work extra hours at the ordinary hourly rate—that is, without overtime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision initially applied to 12 awards nominated in the bill, but the number of awards to which this simplified additional-hours provision applies can be expanded by regulation. It's another pernicious increase in the amount of delegated legislation, which of course is a matter that this Senate should be concerned about. This is a provision that will inevitably reduce job security, because it effectively casualises part-time workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The better off overall test has been a crucial protection for workers during EBA negotiations. The Fair Work Commission has been able to exclude changes that would disadvantage employers, but this bill suspends those protections. And with greenfield agreements, the bill provides extended new EBA periods of up to eight years. This provision will apply for projects with a construction cost of $500 million, but the minister can declare it to be a 'major project' and the production cost can be as low as $250 million—and we know that, on the scale of infrastructure projects in this country, that is not a great deal of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the parliament's ability to scrutinise these agreements, to hold to government to account, is removed, and the government's capacity to introduce flexibility, as defined by employers, is increased dramatically. This bill increase penalties for the underpayment of wages, and that's a good thing. But the government is very deceptive. It does not define what 'dishonesty' is. It does not in fact provide the protections it is alluding to. These measures are in no way a plan for recovery and they in no way protect us from the precariousness and the undermining of working conditions in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  I'd like to begin my contribution to this debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia’s Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021—the government's changes to workplace laws—with a story of a guy in Central Queensland who I've got to know pretty well through my travels in Central Queensland over the past few years. His name is Chad. Chad's a coalminer, employed as a casual, through a labour hire company, by a major multinational mining company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chad has been treated as a casual, paid as a casual and employed as a casual by that mining company and the labour hire firm despite the fact that for over seven years he has worked the same roster, week after week, month after month and year after year. If any objective person were to look at Chad's employment and recognise that he works the same shifts, week after week, month after month and year after year, they would say that he is a permanent employee. And if Chad and the thousands of colleagues he has who are employed on the same basis were treated as permanent employees they would get job security, they would get annual leave, they would get sick leave, they would be able to get a home loan and they would be able to take a day off when a member of their family was unwell and needed attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course Chad and his colleagues who are employed as casuals, despite really being permanent employees, get none of those benefits. Chad, and every casual employee—whether they be coalminers or in any other industry—who are really permanent workers, don't get job security, they don't get annual leave, they don't get sick leave and they don't get a whole host of other benefits that permanent workers get. And of course they can't even go and get a home loan from a bank, because they're casual employees and banks don't lend those sorts of sums of money to casual employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chad is just one example of what I have come to learn is an epidemic of casualisation in the mining industry across regional Queensland. It's not just in the mining industry, and I'll come to that shortly, but it's certainly something which has changed dramatically in the mining industry in Queensland over recent years—the explosion of casualisation and labour hire at the expense of permanent employment. Major mining companies in this country now employ the majority of their workforce as casuals through labour hire firms. It's being done as a cost-cutting exercise; the mining companies don't deny that. It's important that mining companies make profits and it's important that mining companies employ people, but it is a tragedy that in recent years, on this government's watch, we have seen that occur at the expense of coalminers and workers in general.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give another example, of two other miners who I've met: Simon and Ron. Simon is the permanent employee, paid the EBA rate of pay. He has permanent employment, job security and all those types of leave benefits that come with permanent employment. His colleague Ron, who does exactly the same work as him—day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out and year in, year out—is employed through a labour hire firm as a casual. Ron doesn't get the permanent employment, he doesn't get the job security, he doesn't get the leave and he doesn't get all the benefits of permanent employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just some academic exercise; this has real-life consequences for people. As I said, they miss out on all of those benefits and they can't get loans. It puts immense stress on their families because they never know from one day to the next whether they're actually going to have a job. That's one of the consequences of casual employment: you don't have job security. You can be terminated by your employer at very short notice and without the usual redundancy pay that permanent employees get. So you're in constant fear and your family is under constant stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a disgrace that this casualisation epidemic has exploded across regional Queensland on this government's watch. Day after day, we see members of this government from the LNP in Queensland say how much they love coal, dressing up like coalminers and parading themselves around as if they're the friends of coalminers—</span>

                    </a>  You're right, Senator Ayres; some of them, including Senator Canavan, actually even go as far as wiping a bit of dust on their faces to impersonate coalminers! But every time they're actually given the opportunity to do something to help coalminers, or other workers who are trapped in casualisation, they squib it. Every single time they line up with big businesses which are making profits at the expense of ordinary working people. This legislation that we're dealing with today is just another example of that. Have you ever noticed that the only time we hear anything about casualisation from this government is in the run-up to an election? I've been here about five years—</span>

                    </a>  It has gone quickly. But, sadly, what has been going on in the time that I've been here is this government's continued neglect of casual workers. In the run-up to the last election we put a lot of pressure on the government to fix this casualisation epidemic, as did our friends in the union movement, as did workers themselves. Because we put so much pressure on the government, in the run-up to the last election they promised to fix casualisation. I remember in the run-up to the last election all the press releases, the press conferences, the advertisements with George Christensen, Michelle Landry, Matt Canavan and Ken O'Dowd, all saying they would fix casualisation. And here we are, nearly two years after that election, and they still haven't done anything about it. They did the same thing in the run-up to the Queensland state election last year. They were silent for a year and a half after the federal election, having said they would fix it, but in the weeks leading up to the Queensland election, they were going to fix it again. They brought in this legislation which not only doesn't fix casualisation but actually makes things worse. It opens the door for more casualisation of our workplaces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken quite a bit about the effect of casualisation and labour hire in the mining industry, because that is one of the most egregious examples that we've seen in recent times. But this is something that is affecting so many different parts of our economy and so many different types of workplaces. Throughout our workplaces, in security, in aged care, in retail and—I'm sure, Senator Sterle—in the trucking industry, we see this explosion of casualisation, insecure work and labour hire with people being exploited. This government continues to do nothing about it. I well remember a particular day in the last term of this government. I'm pretty sure I was in Rockhampton—certainly I was in regional Queensland—talking to coalminers about labour hire and casualisation and how hard their lives were as a result. I got on a plane to head home to Brisbane to do a function with Commonwealth public servants, mostly working in places like Centrelink and the tax office. Do you know what their No. 1 complaint was? It was the fact that this government was moving so many of their colleagues onto labour hire and casual work. In the space of one day, you can go from two different parts of Queensland, talk to blue-collar workers in the mining industry and white-collar workers in the Commonwealth Public Service and they'll have the same complaint about the fact that they can't get permanent work because there's been such a push towards casualisation of their work and labour hire. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear from the apologists for casualisation that it's okay, people choose to be casuals, people get compensated as casuals, they get a loading and all that kind of thing. I don't know where they're getting their figures. I invite any of those people to come with me next time I go and speak to miners in Central Queensland or to public servants in Brisbane, or anywhere in between, because they will tell you that, despite the fact that they miss out on the benefits of permanent employment—the leave, the regular hours, the job security—they actually get paid less than the permanent workers, even after their casual loading is applied. So this claim that casual workers are fairly compensated for missing out on the benefits of permanency through their casual loading is absolute rubbish. I have met people working in the mining industry who are being paid less on an hourly basis than the permanent workers they work right next to, and they're still missing out on all the benefits of permanency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a tragedy for the individuals concerned and their families but it's also a tragedy for regional economies. At a point when we know the economy is very weak, when consumer confidence is very low, what we actually need is a workplace system that gives people the confidence that from one day to the next their job is going to be safe, their wages are going to increase, they will be fairly treated at work. If people have that confidence, they're more likely to take out a loan, they're more likely to go and spend money in the local shops and businesses. Do you know what? That creates more jobs. But, instead, people are terrified of losing their jobs and of not being able to pay off their loans. They rein in their spending, which means we don't have those jobs created in local economies. So this system that the government is presiding over, which will be made worse by this bill, actually threatens to prolong the pain that we are experiencing through this recession and it threatens to rein in the recovery that we all so desperately want to see happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my contribution I have focused a lot on casualisation because it is something that is of great concern to many workers, but there are a whole range of other changes that are being proposed in this bill which will also make people's employment more insecure, rein in their confidence, cut their pay and take away conditions that have been hard won over many years. Again, those changes, whether we're talking about changes to greenfield agreements, to flexible work directions or to how enterprise bargaining is achieved—all of those things combined—are on the wish list for big business and will actually only harm the average working person and be another impediment to trade unions doing their job of working with workers to try to achieve better pay and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to give one example, which goes back to casualisation, of what these laws actually will do—laws that this government says will fix casualisation—is to leave in the hands of employers to choose whether someone is going to be employed as a casual or as a permanent. At least under the current system an employee has the opportunity to go to a tribunal to get a fair hearing as to whether or not they're actually a casual or a permanent. But these laws would enshrine and entrench power in the hands of employers to make the decision at the point of employment about whether or not someone is a permanent or a casual. And even if an employer decides, 'Okay, Johnny, you're going to be a casual,' when the facts are that they're permanent, Johnny's going to be employed as a casual, and there's nothing he's going to be able to do about it because that's what these laws will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, what these laws do is effectively leave it up to employers to decide whether or not someone will be able to convert to permanency after 12 months. The government's out there saying that this is going to give casual employees the right to convert to permanency after 12 months. What they don't tell you is that the decision is still left to the employer as to whether or not they will convert someone to permanency, and it basically takes away all appeal rights that an employee has. An employee whose employer unfairly turns them down when they ask to be made permanent can go off to the Fair Work Commission, but only to get conciliation of the matter. The Fair Work Commission can't actually make a decision that someone is a permanent or should be made permanent, and the only option that a casual employee has to enforce their rights is to trot off to the Federal Court. I don't know about you but I haven't found many casual coalminers, public servants, retail assistants or hospitality workers who have a lazy $50,000, $70,000 or $100,000 sitting around in their pockets to spend on barristers to fight out a matter in the Federal Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These laws do nothing to fix the casualisation crisis that we've seen across Queensland and across the country. In fact, what they will do is make things worse. Labor have been very clear from the moment we saw this bill that we will be opposing these laws, because what they will do is actually entrench casualisation in the workforce. They will see people's pay cut and conditions taken away from them at the very time that we want to see people spending more in our local economies and creating more jobs and having more secure employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one group who still haven't shared their hand about what they're going to do on this legislation, and that is Senator Hanson and her colleague, Senator Roberts, in One Nation. This legislation is a very big test for One Nation. They've spent a lot of time rolling around Queensland talking about how much they support battlers. Well, this will be a test. Will they vote with Labor to stop this legislation which will cut workers' pay, or will they side with the LNP and back in big business?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  On this day last year Australia had recorded its 100th confirmed case of COVID-19. There were recorded coronavirus cases in every state and territory. There'd been COVID-19 deaths in New South Wales and in Western Australia. The first, ultimately inadequate, stimulus package had been announced and the first public health restrictions were coming into effect. Australia's case numbers were rising in line with comparable countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. Our trend followed that of Italy, who'd just entered their lockdown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the isolation measures were announced, millions of Australian workers lost their jobs—700,000 in the first week of April. Those who could do so prepared to work from home. And still millions of Australian workers went to work. They were the essential workers, the ones we could not function without. Every morning, many of them went into a dangerous and uncertain world. Health workers, doctors, nurses, paramedics, receptionists, porters and cleaners risked exposure to the virus to treat those who were already infected. It was dangerous and important work, and it still is. In January, the International Council of Nurses announced that globally 2,262 nurses died from coronavirus in 2020, yet nurses went to work. Some of them came out of retirement in order to staff hospitals. We saw that same courage in so many types of workers in those early months—teachers, supermarket transport and warehouse workers, aged-care workers, cleaners and food-manufacturing workers. Those were food-manufacturing workers like the ones on strike at McCormick today, who haven't had a pay rise for five years. The company's opportunistically using these current bargaining laws to strip away their rights, entitlements and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A promise was made by the Parliament of Australia in that moment of fear and uncertainty that as a nation we would rebuild in a way which would look after those workers who have looked after us. This bill is a repudiation of that promise. It is a broken promise for Australian workers. It is especially a broken promise to all of those workers, mostly women, who stood by us during the pandemic. If it's passed, it will make workers' jobs less secure. If it's passed, it will mean many workers are subject to pay cuts and less secure work. It will casualise some permanent workers' jobs and create new loopholes for employers to exploit and put competitive pressure on those good employers in a race to the bottom in Australian workplaces to drive their own wages and conditions down. It will further entrench a bargaining system that is sclerotic and failing and that denies workers the right to be effectively represented and to win the pay and conditions they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Porter, the architect of this piece of legislation, is conspicuously absent this week. He's availed himself to the paid leave that this bill would deny to many millions of Australian workers. In his speech commending this bill to the other chamber the minister concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill removes barriers that stifle the job growth of today and limits the job creation of tomorrow …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Morrison government, measures to give workers a fair say in their conditions of work are an impediment. To the Morrison government, measures to ensure job security and protections for fair collective bargaining are a problem for employers. The underlying assumption of this bill is that the recovery will be built on an increasingly insecure labour market, low wages and less secure jobs. That's not a plan to rebuild the Australian economy. That is a plan to entrench the problems that were already present in our labour market, that were driving higher levels of casualisation and that were producing more bad jobs in the economy instead of producing good jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For one thing, Australia's bad experiences during the coronavirus pandemic were in no small part driven by problems in our labour market. There were leaks from quarantine facilities that had come from insecure workers forced to take multiple jobs just to make ends meet and, particularly in Melbourne, spread by casual workers who were forced into an impossible choice between their own family's financial security and taking appropriate public health measures in the public interest. It was that combination of insecure work and working multiple jobs that brought the virus into our nursing homes, yet the government's plan does nothing to deal with insecure work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problems of insecure work are well documented. It's not as if we don't know what they are. Casual workers can't make long-term financial decisions. Many of them can't buy a house. It expands the gender pay gap. Women workers are more likely to be casual workers. It means that businesses fail to invest in skills, and the long-term real productivity gains that this country needs are not made. Real economic recovery doesn't come from cutting wages and it doesn't come from holding back real wage growth. A real plan for recovery would come from investing in Australian workers. A real plan for recovery would understand that job security is a critical component of all of our long-term prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A bargaining system should encourage employers to negotiate fairly. It should ensure that workers' interests are properly represented. It should ensure that workers solve these problems in partnership with their employers, on an equal footing. It should allow labour market institutions to deal with the real productivity problems that plague our economy. It should deliver real, tangible economic benefits for everybody. It's not just about fairness and ensuring that Australian workers have the democratic rights that they deserve and should be their birthright in this country; it's about building a better type of economy, about lifting productivity and about creating more good jobs. This plan does nothing to achieve any of those objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month Anthony Albanese offered a very different vision of work and dealing with insecure work in the economy: job security explicitly inserted into the Fair Work Act; rights for gig economy workers through the Fair Work Commission—and five food delivery workers have died in Sydney over the last six months; there's no plan from the government to deal with that question—portable entitlements for workers in insecure industries; 'casual' work properly defined; a crackdown on cowboy labour hire firms that plague in particular the mining industry—and Senator Canavan and some of these other characters put the Maybelline on, pretend they are mining workers, wander around in high-viz and confect interest in the jobs of mining industry workers, but when it counts they're on the side of the worst kind of labour hire operations that discriminate against ordinary workers and put them in a very tough position indeed—a cap on back-to-back contracts for the same role; more secure public sector jobs; government contracts to companies and organisations that offer secure work; and, on top of that, a real plan to deal with the gender pay gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a very different vision of the economy. What has been shown this week is that there are two very divergent visions for the future of the Australian economy and Australian jobs: firstly, Scott Morrison and Mr Porter's sclerotic, narrow, pea-hearted vision of a race to the bottom on wages and conditions on a low-wage, low-road future for Australian workers and, secondly, Anthony Albanese and Labor's vision of lifting everybody up, of producing more good jobs, of having a real strategy to lift wages and conditions and to improve productivity in Australian workplaces—a vision that keeps its promise to those essential workers who stood by us during the pandemic and delivers fairness and prosperity to everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been critical failures of leadership by this government when it comes to the economy and the public health response. This government had to be dragged to measures to stop mass redundancies. This government left it to the states to run quarantine, blamed them when it went wrong and undermined it. I remember seeing senators from here, from Western Australia and Queensland, bellowing about opening the borders. It was Mr Morrison, the Prime Minister, who teamed up with Clive Palmer, so he can indeed take credit for the Western Australian election result. He should take credit for the Western Australian election result, because it was his decision to team up with that plutocratic, absolutely in the interests of Clive Palmer and Mr Morrison, to undermine the public health response in Western Australia. If they had succeeded—and every Western Australia knows this—the Western Australian economy would have been decimated, as well as the public health response. The truth is that there's no economic recovery without a public health recovery. The states got it right and Mr Morrison got it wrong at every juncture last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of March two important events will occur. One is that the JobKeeper program ends and the second is that we will get to see whether Mr Morrison's promise to the people of Australia that four million vaccines will be delivered will really come to fruition. We'll see whether the four million vaccines that Mr Morrison promised have been delivered around the country. Why on earth are we cutting the JobKeeper program when we know that it will cost at least 110,000 jobs? Why on earth are we cutting that program if Mr Morrison can't deliver on his promise to Australian workers and the Australian people?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And why on earth would Senators Hansen and Roberts, and anybody on the crossbench, vote for this rotten piece of legislation, which will make workers' jobs less secure, not more secure? We should be legislating in this place to make people's lives better, to make people's lives safer and to lift people's wages and conditions. Instead, the miserable vision that this government has is a bit of tinkering to create a few more loopholes to make it easier for bad employers to work their way through the system and undermine wages and conditions. It puts pressure on good employers to do the wrong thing in order to compete and survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of doing what we should be doing, Mr Morrison is breaking the promise that he made to those workers who got us through the recovery. The strongest symbol of that, of course, is the fact that the Minister for Industrial Relations is not here to push this package through the parliament and make the arguments for it. The Prime Minister wants this chamber to pass significant changes to our industrial relations system while there are serious questions about whether the Minister for Industrial Relations is indeed fit to hold his own job. The Prime Minister wants this chamber to pass a bill condemning more workers to insecure work and which erodes their right to negotiate better wages and conditions while the relevant minister is on paid leave. The Prime Minister wants this chamber to pass a bill that will likely extend the gender pay gap in a week when thousands of Australian women have been marching for equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the demands, indeed, of those marchers—one of the things that has been squarely on the government over the course of the last 12 months—is that if they were really interested in people's rights in Australian workplaces they would deal with the <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">espect</span><span style="font-style:italic;">@work</span> report, which was launched more than 12 months ago. Three out of 55 recommendations in that have been partially dealt with. If that's a measure of the commitment of this government, and if this bill is a measure of the commitment of this government to better jobs, no wonder our labour market performance is deteriorating so badly.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on this very important piece of legislation, the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021. There are a lot of perceptions in the community about how difficult it is for people to understand the lawmaking that goes on in this place, but I want to make a few things pretty clear to the ordinary Australians who vote and send us here and expect us to stand up for them, especially when the government is going to have a good go at them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has created this bill and called it an omnibus bill. It has 'bus' at the end of it. We understand what a bus is; it carries an awful lot of people. This bill carries an awful lot of legislation in it, and it's going to affect every Australian. It's very significant. Instead of having a long time line for careful consideration of the legislation they're advancing, the government limited the amount of time for due scrutiny of this bill. I know that the crossbench, who deal with Labor senators in good faith on many issues, will be paying attention to this debate. They were right when they made it clear on the weekend that they wouldn't support this legislation this week not only because it's such a bad piece of legislation, which I will get to, but because of the unseemly haste with which the government has tried to push it through.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of allowing hearings right across this country for Australians to participate in, the government forced us to hold only three days of hearings. The committee travelled to Townsville and to Adelaide for hearings, and then had a hearing in Canberra. People were on the clock for half an hour each, being rolled in one after the other. They were not even able to have their say. The committee had to apologise to nurses who came to Adelaide to give evidence, because they weren't allowed to give their statements because there wasn't adequate time allocated. That is the contempt we see from the government about due process, and the people of Australia are waking up to it on many fronts. This is not just an idea out there that might or might not affect you; this is something that is going to affect your business. If you're a decent businessperson employing people in your local community, you're going to be caught in this trap the government is setting. The changes the government is advancing are being advanced by people acting in bad faith against the workers and the good small businesses of this country.</span>

She got across the detail. She stood up on behalf of nurses at the front line. She came to Adelaide, and this is as much as she got out on this legislation:</span>

This is a Frankenstein amalgam of anti-union provisions meant, deliberately, to crush wages at a time when workers absolutely need them to grow. The bill as it stands for debate is a little changed from what it was just a few weeks ago, when the last version of the bill sought to exempt enterprise bargaining agreements from the better off overall test. That was so bad; it was really the 'worse off overall test' the government wanted to put in. The crossbench stood up to them at the time and said: 'Forget it. That's just got to go.' The government, under pressure from the crossbench, removed that. Well, the crossbench have the power to halt this bill today, and that is what I encourage them to do. </span>

Flexibility that only goes one way is a form of abuse. Flexibility for workers and flexibility for business owners needs to be something that's negotiated in good faith, and nothing about this bill has been undertaken in good faith. Everything about it has been a stitch-up by very, very powerful advocates of the largest businesses in this country against decent, hardworking sole traders, small-business men and women, and the workers of this nation, who keep things on the road. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government ludicrously pretends that this bill will allow a path to permanent conversion for a casual worker. But, in fact, what it does is the exact opposite. It gives the employer a veto over that request. We had considerable evidence about this. If you're a casual worker and you definitely want to be a casual worker—sometimes it does suit people's lives—that's not a bad thing. But, if you're a casual worker who can't get a car loan because you're a casual worker or if you're a casual worker who can't get a housing loan because you are a casual worker and you decide you'd like to become permanent, do you know what this government has cooked up for you? A few magic words: 'Give them the old razzle-dazzle so they can say that they're giving them casual conversion.' Mr Morrison—the master of spin and show, the showman—</span>

                    </a>  Absolutely! The reality is that, under this legislation, your employer will actually be able to say: 'There's a pattern of work. If I don't really want to have to offer them casual work, I'll just change their pattern of work and, then, in that last six months, they haven't worked a regular pattern—sorry, not eligible.' The definition of 'casual' is really entirely up to the employer. If they say you're casual, you're casual. You're stuck with it. That is not an advance in security for the Australian people. That is not good business practice. It's not good for the genuinely great small business employers who know their employees by name, who pay the right wages, who want to do the right thing. In the committee hearings, they were on the record talking about the need for a very, very different view of the conversion from casual status to full-time work. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that this bill does address one issue that is relevant to some states—that is, the crime of wage theft, which is absent in federal legislation. Again, it is so close. They look like they're doing the right thing, but it's a bit like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wizard of Oz</span>: you pull back the curtain, and what's really going on with the machine? Well, behind the scenes, what this really means is that, for workers in Queensland and for workers in Victoria, this legislation will water down the protections they have in getting back the wages stolen from them by unscrupulous employers. These are stolen wages, wages taken from Australian workers. They've showed up, they've worked the shifts, they've done the hours, they've provided the service—they've done their part of the deal. This government says, 'We need to do something about wage theft, but, oh, my God, let's make sure we don't do it as well as Victoria or Queensland.' They've literally got the template for how to do it right, yet, if this bill passes today, they take those rights away from the workers of Queensland and Victoria. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I say to the crossbench: do not let this government get away with this absolute con job. It is a con job with regard to protection of workers' wages. I had a great conversation with Senator Gallacher, who is in the chamber and who may be making a contribution very shortly, about who's robbed when wages are robbed. It's not just the individual, and I'm sure he'll make more comments about that himself. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">for various sets of arrangements to take people's wages. On 1 July this year that Victorian legislation comes into effect. Is that why the government are so hell-bent on pushing this through this week? Do they want to trump Victorians, who fought for their fantastic piece of legislation for years and years and years? Is that the idea? Get the crossbench on board, look like you've done a little bit of work this week and totally do over the Victorian and Queensland states and everyone who lives and works there? Is that what the rush is, because if that's the reason for the rush then that is another reason why the crossbench should say, 'Hold the phone guys; we are not going to advance with this today.' There are so many reasons why this bill should not be passed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when everyone from unions and the Reserve Bank to prominent business leaders are clamouring for the government to do anything—anything!—to grow wages, the government have introduced this bill that will cut wages. Deloitte Access Economics reports that, even on our current trajectory, Australian workers could wait up to five years for wage growth. If this bill passes it will be even longer before you get a wage rise. If the government were really serious about helping struggling businesses, they wouldn't be pushing this through today. Instead, they would be advancing something to support the extension of JobSeeker, especially for select industries that are still struggling from lockdowns and the pandemic. They should be keeping consumers spending, not rashly ending the supplements for JobSeeker and JobKeeper, which have lifted thousands of Australians out of poverty for the first time in years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are nine public health experts from the Australian National University in Canberra who wrote about this bill. One of the terms they used to describe it was that 'it is an immediate threat to public health'. That's how they described the bill that this government is trying to get the crossbench to sign onto today. Their submission notes that Australia has one of the highest rates of individuals without leave entitlements. I love Australia. I'm so proud to be Australian, even though I am celebrating St Patrick's Day today. The reality is we have problems in our country. Leave entitlements in Australia are amongst the lowest in the OECD, with estimates ranging from 25 per cent to 37 per cent of the workforce without them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sick and tired of the attacks on workers by this coalition government. If it isn't an attack on their democratic representatives in the union movement, it's an attack on Australians' wages and conditions. It's a Neanderthal view from those opposite that the only way to achieve economic growth, the only way to achieve national prosperity, is to pay workers less, to make them work more hours and to give them more insecure conditions. It is a recipe for disaster for this country—not just for individuals but for the whole fabric of society. We should all be sharing in the wealth of this nation, instead of concocting, through this omnibus bill, some ridiculous plan to disadvantage Australian workers, the people on whom this country relies to lift us during pandemics, to lift us every day when they go to work. They need security; they don't need this bill. They need leave; they don't need this bill. They don't need this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I rise to speak against the passing of the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021. There was a time when the conservative side of the chamber was much more forthright and open. The Hon. Peter Reith gave a speech at the Royal Perth Yacht Club where he said: 'I know whose side I'm on. I'm on the side of business—small businesses, medium sized businesses and big businesses, and we will do what's necessary for those businesses.' I think that's what's missing in this debate. I listened to the contributions from Senator Bragg and others talking almost as if they were the workers' friends. They are far from the workers' friends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put some economic data on the record before I hop into a bit of criticism of the other side. The share of national income going to Australian workers has been steadily declining since the 1970s, with the profit share increasing. But the labour share has suddenly fallen below 50 per cent for the first time since 1959. Obviously the trend is exacerbated by the COVID-19 recession. On Thursday, the Bureau of Statistics released its June quarter gross domestic product data, and the data showed that economic activity across April, May and June shrank by seven per cent, the biggest quarterly contraction in 60 years. But the ABS noted something else. It said that company profits jumped a massive 14.9 per cent in this quarter, while the total wages and salaries bill for workers—characterised as compensation for workers—fell by a record 2.5 per cent. That meant that the labour share of income has fallen below 50 per cent for the first time in decades, while profits have hit record levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would wages and salaries decline when the government has been providing billions of dollars for JobKeeper payments? Mr Pickering, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab and a former Reserve Bank official, told the ABC the emergency subsidies to businesses had helped:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What's basically happened is there's been a range of sectors that have reported quite a significant increase in profits, largely due to subsidies received from the government — JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, we've had a significant decline in employment, which is putting downward pressure on compensation of employees [wages and salaries].</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, he said, the large shift in the income share between labour and profit in the June quarter should only be temporary:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It should unwind over the coming quarters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Saul Eslake, a very familiar name in economic circles and now a Vice-Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Tasmania, said the noticeable shift in income share in the June quarter was largely a 'statistical artefact'. He said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's because a whole lot of people stopped working and had their income replaced by government benefits, so profits represented a bigger share of what was left.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From one perspective, you could say JobKeeper propped up profits and in a way they did, because if it hadn't have been for JobKeeper, profits probably would have been a lot lower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But it's basically showing that a whole lot of employees, and hence their wage payments, were removed from the equation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Eslake said there was an important phenomenon to consider when thinking about this issue. He said that we had to keep in mind what had happened to low-paid workers this year. He said that the data shows average non-farm compensation per employee actually increased by 3.3 per cent in the June quarter and by five per cent from a year earlier. That was the fastest year-on-year growth in that measurement since March 2012. Mr Eslake said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, how do you explain the total wage share going down [by 2.5 per cent] and the average non-farm compensation per employee going up?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The answer is: it was disproportionately low-income and low-paid workers who've lost their jobs this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So, what's left tend to be higher-paid people, and even though higher-paid people have taken pay cuts themselves, the impact on that has been more than outweighed by the culling of workers at the bottom end of the scale, so the average income goes up, even when the overall income goes down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The punchline, when we get to it, is fairly straightforward: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… over the last six years in Australia especially, and over the last 20 years in other countries, and over the last 40 years in the United States, there has been a steady shift in the distribution of income from labour to capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia was sheltered from that for a while by the mining boom, but not anymore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we have a predicament like that, where labour's share of national income has consistently been declining for a number of years and has now fallen below 50 per cent, disproportionately shareholders and companies are taking the lion's share of the national income. So you end up with low inflation, clearly not a bad thing, but stagnating wage growth. In an environment where people can't get a pay rise at the moment, where people can't get an increase in hours at the moment, where some of them can't get jobs at the moment, we have an omnibus bill designed to help them. Well, I think I've been around industrial relations long enough to know that the other side of the chamber has never put up a bill that's designed to help workers get a pay rise. If they were honest, they would say that. There's never been a case where that side of the chamber has put forward any sort of legislation which is designed to get people a greater share for their labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It just doesn't happen, and Peter Reith was honest enough to say that. That honesty is lacking on that side of the chamber now, because people are saying, 'Look, we're helping you.' They're not helping people into higher, more secure, better paid employment. They're not doing that at all. They're making it easier for employers to spread the meagre amount of money they want to spend on labour across a greater number of people. We will end up exactly like the United States, where, if you're working in a bar or restaurant and you don't get a tip, you basically can't pay your rent; you can't afford your outgoings. I don't think those on the other side of the chamber are innovative enough or smart enough to come up with a new scheme, with a new paradigm; they're basically taking an old well-trodden path in the United States, in the United Kingdom, in other parts of the world, bringing it to Australia and making Australia a poorer place for working people. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they were honest, they would say that their job is to look after capital, 'and you lot look after labour'. But what's happened in looking after labour is they had 12 years of the Howard government, with probably another seven years of this government, which makes it extremely difficult for organised labour to actually operate. In the meantime, as Senator O'Neill alluded to, they're actually ripping off Australia. There are submissions to the wage theft inquiry which say that the amount of forgone taxation revenue from wage theft would probably be approaching a $9 billion hit to the national economy. The amount of forgone contributions tax on super is also quite a large figure. The Taxation Office is on record saying what it is. Coincidentally, the Taxation Office is in charge of collecting it. They know how much has been forgone, but they don't take any steps to collect it. If this government and the other side of the chamber had half the acumen they profess to possess, they would stick on another thousand tax collectors. I think the figures are quite simple: for every dollar you spend on a tax collector, the return to the government is $5 to $6, so another thousand people in the taxation department chasing people who are not paying superannuation and therefore not paying contributions tax would be beneficial. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we had another group of people looking at those who systematically underpay wages, we would have more taxation revenue. We're not talking about mum and dad with two trucks or mum and dad with a small landscaping business; we're talking about huge corporations, like Woolworths owning up to $300 million worth of underpayment. How much was forgone in the taxation area? How much was forgone in the superannuation area? But, no, the coalition came up with the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021, which I think basically will mean: if you haven't got a job, you can probably get one, but it's not going to be as well paid as the one you lost, and, by the way, we'll determine whether you're actually going to get overtime or not based on who's willing to work. If you're starving or you've got bills to pay and you want overtime, you won't get it, but, if someone wants to continue on ordinary pay, they will get it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are disgraceful things: eight-year agreements. Who's going to know what is happening in terms of the CPI and the like in eight years time? By the way, you won't get a chance to negotiate that because, if it's a $250 million investment, that will be done before you get there. By the time you get there, it will be: 'Great news! We have an eight-year agreement here.' If you ask what the wage rise is, they'll say, 'Stuff all,' or you might get CPI or half a per cent. Anyway, that'll be nothing to do with you; that will already be sorted out. How do you change it? You can't. This is a prescription for a dire situation. We should be trying to recover for people proper, full-time, secure work that's reasonably paid, not creating another underclass of people in Australia who will never see permanent employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many young people at the moment who have never had the luxury of a permanent job. They have never had it. They can get 16, 17, 22 or 25 hours but they can't get a permanent job. In other areas of quite reasonable economic activity, you have an inordinate number of casuals or labour hire people. Once again, those people don't see a permanent opportunity coming forward. But the coalition's putting up the smokescreen, in my view, that this legislation is coming along to help reinvigorate the economy. If the national labour income share continues to decline, we'll end up exactly like the United States, where you have a lot of people who, since the seventies, haven't seen their share of the wealth of their great country increase, which hasn't been good for the economy. America's deficit, you can't count the zeroes on the end of it. Australia's different. I suppose because we are different and capital is no different—capital is international—we're attracting attention. But I wish that those on the other side would at least come to the argument with clean hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACTU and other parties sat down with the Hon. Christian Porter and the Hon. Josh Frydenberg and attempted to resolve areas of concern. But, in my view, the whole lot should be just opposed absolutely. There are no redeeming features in here which will redress what is a national shame—that workers who carry this country, such as cleaners, garbagemen and all of the people who do all of those jobs we take for granted, are not getting a fair share of the national income. This bill will make sure that that never happens. It will never happen. They will be consigned to insecure work, low pay and no hope for the foreseeable future. Unless the electorate changes and votes in a different government, there will be no respite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Actually, this is a culmination of decades of attacks on working people. We are now starting to see, in economic measuring terms, the fact that the labour share of income is dropping below 50 per cent of national income. I would prefer an economy where we were growing through productivity and economic activity, where workers were getting an increasing share of the national income, because workers spend their money. Workers do not put it in a tin and dig a hole in the garden or send it to the Cayman Islands and seek to avoid tax. There's no seeking to avoid tax if you're a wages and salary earner. You earn your money, tax goes to the appropriate place, super goes to the appropriate place and you are contributing fully to the economy. If we paid that sector correctly and gave them more freedom to bargain and the ability to increase their wages and contribute economically, they would educate their families and contribute all around in the community, and Australia would be a much better place. I don't want to see the low-wage inequality that exists in the United States.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  It's my great pleasure to rise and speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was disappointed to hear the contribution of Senator Gallacher, who made a number of sweeping statements, many of which were incorrect, with no credibility. Unfortunately, it reflects the sad fact that Labor doesn't seem to understand that strong businesses equal more jobs and greater opportunities for Australian workers. I just want to put on the record that I can only imagine, if the member for Maribyrnong, Mr Shorten, had been elected prime minister in 2019 with his plan to impose $387 billion of more taxes on Australians, what that would have done to this country. So I reject very strongly the sweeping, discredited statements made by Senator Gallacher which do not, in any way, represent the truth of the work of our government, the Morrison government, in backing jobs and our economic recovery at this very important time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that COVID-19 has derailed our economy and forced hundreds of thousands of Australians into the bleakness of unemployment or being stood down. Despite the darkness of 2020—the lockdowns, the mass closures of businesses, the isolation from our friends and families—one small glimmer of hope remained: that all of this would eventually pass and that we would emerge, once again, a stronger and more resilient nation than before. Already we have seen huge rebounds in our economic recovery, led by Prime Minister Morrison and the many hardworking members of our government. There are few better indications that this hope has been vindicated than this bill, which manifests the government's commitment to ensuring Australians get back to work quickly and fairly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a number of balanced and sensible changes to the Fair Work Act which will stimulate jobs growth and boost the economy. It provides much-needed certainty to businesses and employees by clearly defining what it means to be a casual employee, and it gives eligible casual employees a pathway to permanent full-time or part-time jobs that are guaranteed by statute. The bill gives casual employees the best of both worlds. If they wish to remain casually employed, they can do so and take advantage of the flexibility of casual work. However—this is probably a key issue which Senator Gallacher overlooked—if they wish to transition to full-time or part-time work, they can do that too and take advantage of the stability of these forms of work. In this way the bill gives casual employees concrete rights which respect their employment choices, but it also gives employers the kind of certainty and transparency they need when negotiating agreements with prospective employees. The bill also introduces greater flexibility into awards in sectors of the economy hardest hit by the pandemic: the retail and hospitality industries. Many businesses in these industries have emerged in the wake of the pandemic battered and bruised but are still fighting hard to keep the employees they have and take on new ones. This government is committed to helping these hard-working Australians re-establish themselves in our economy. In keeping with this commitment, the bill adapts the government's successful JobKeeper flexibilities concerning duties and location of work, which helped save thousands upon thousands of jobs during the pandemic. They remain available for employers and employees to whom key awards apply across the hard-hit retail and hospitality sectors. The bill also allows employers and part-time employees in these sectors, which together employ over a third of all casual employees, to work together to agree on additional hours of work for part-time employees who want them. This will help to increase working hours and wages. It will also encourage employers to offer more permanent and secure roles with benefits including paid sick leave, over traditionally more flexible forms of employment like casual roles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill simplifies and expedites enterprise bargaining by requiring that these agreements be finalised, as far as practicable, within 21 working days. This means employers can get on with creating jobs and employees can enter the workforce more quickly, easily and fairly. Enterprise agreements pay, on average, 69 per cent more per week than award wages. That is an average of $542 more per week. This shows that the government is serious, not just about getting Australians back to work but also about getting them better working conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A big part of the government's plan for Australia's economic recovery is securing investment for greenfields agreements involved in large-scale projects valued at over $500 million, or between $250 million and $500 million if they are major projects of national or regional significance. The bill enables the Fair Work Commission to approve greenfields agreements for longer-term major projects by allowing the nominal expiry date to go up to eight years. In this way, the bill ensures that there will be certainty for investors in these large-scale projects, and this will help to create jobs and drive wage growth. In other words, employers and large-scale projects cannot be held to ransom by protracted and uncertain EBA negotiations, which put jobs at risk. The bill also protects workers on these projects by guaranteeing that any longer-term greenfields agreements will include annual pay increases for the nominal life of the agreement. Of course, this government proposes these changes with its eyes wide open. We all know that some businesses—including universities, I might add—have in the past underpaid their workers. In light of this, the bill introduces stronger protections for employees by instituting tougher penalties and orders to deter noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are incredibly important measures. They include a new criminal offence for dishonest and systematic underpayments of one or more employees, with a maximum penalty of four years imprisonment, automatic director disqualification for five years and/or a $1.1 million fine, or $5.55 million for a body corporate. The measures also include increasing maximum civil penalties for underpayments, sham contracting and failure to comply with a regulator compliance notice; increasing penalties available under infringement notices; and prohibiting employers from advertising jobs with pay rates below the relevant national minimum wage. The measures also include clarifying that the courts can make adverse publicity orders where appropriate. The bill encourages businesses to proactively identify and self-disclose and to rectify underpayments more quickly and efficiently to ensure that employees are repaid as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good bill. It is good for the economy. It is good for employers. It is good for employees. This bill and these changes to our law are good for all Australians. It is a bill that takes the economic recovery of this country seriously and tackles the challenges of casual employment for both employers and employees head-on. It complements the government's other economic measures, such as the $9 billion of tax cuts that have already gone into the pockets of hardworking Australians. It is a bill that implements changes to the law that will see our economy restored and our hopes fulfilled. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  Here we are today, debating a bill, the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia’s Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021, in the middle of an economic crisis. The government needs to be supporting economic recovery. Instead, we have a bill that makes it easier for employers to cut wages and conditions, which is contrary to our national interest; it's contrary to recovery. On this side of the chamber, in the Labor Party, we stand with working families. We oppose the government's bill that will allow workers to have their pay and conditions cut, leaving them worse off and, indeed, stymieing our national economic recovery. We have a bill that takes rights from workers, and we need a parliament that supports workers and that does not strip them of hard-won rights, pay and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through COVID, we've seen how important it is for us to stand together as a nation to support each other. However, making workers more vulnerable by allowing employers to cut their pay and conditions, which this bill facilitates, is the opposite of that. Our Prime Minister paints himself ostensibly as 'the fair-go PM', yet this bill undermines that fairness. It entrenches insecurity, inequality and a very unfair go for Australian workers. Why does the government want to do this? It won't help economic recovery. It will not help working families. But who does it help? Is it big businesses that claimed JobKeeper while giving executive bonuses, sacking staff and enjoying increased profits? Yes, it certainly helps them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government need to be on the side of workers, not their mates, which makes it easier for them to rip them off. A good example is that, in Qantas, $267 million worth of JobKeeper subsidies retained its workforce. Now it plans to axe 2,000 jobs. These jobs still exist—Qantas still needs baggage handlers—yet Qantas is outsourcing its work and is therefore able to pay workers less, owe them less in entitlements and create more insecure jobs. This bill does nothing to address this. It's unbalanced. It favours employer interests in the name of flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill weakens fundamental safeguards in our industrial system. It does this on the basis of a theory that employers will create jobs only if labour is cheaper. This ignores fundamental economic theory and, indeed, the lived reality in our nation, as economic commentators have shown, that, frankly, labour demand is derived by market demand for goods and services. Lower labour costs do not create jobs and they do not drive productivity; they simply add to profits. Increasing demand and increasing employment require local consumption—consumption that's heavily influenced by confidence. Insecure work and low wages are dampeners on consumer confidence. Again, this bill pushes in the opposite direction. It does nothing to address the problem of insecure work and low wages growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw the attention of this place to the evidence of Ms Sheree Clarke, an aged-care worker whose evidence to the committee was very moving. She said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because most of my work is so insecure, I can only plan to live on my minimum contracted hours, and a contract of 16 hours per fortnight is not enough to live on. This impacts all aspects of my lifestyle, including health. My budget does not allow me to choose healthy options and I often miss meals. Paying my car registration or visiting my dentist is a day-to-day decision for me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She expressed her distress that she could not afford to assist her own elderly parents or even afford her own housing. She said she can't secure a long-term rental lease because she doesn't have an income. She lives in a caravan park. She said:</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in the legislation before us a how-to guide for corporate lawyers who want to construct employment contracts that casualise not just the existing casual jobs but any job in this nation. Far from being a pathway for conversion to permanency, the impact of this bill—on any analysis of the detail—is the opposite. It's there to manipulate the system and contrive employment offers that lock people into casual employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the government did drop one hurtful amendment to the BOOT, but I have to say that this is not a win. The government dropped that disastrous amendment knowing that they would never receive support and creating a facade of compromise, but there has been no compromise. What we have is a bill that's designed to cut workers' pay and conditions and keep going the long-term trend of weakening wage growth in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask this place to think about the frontline workers who risked their safety to serve their communities through the pandemic, who ensured Australians still had food on the supermarket shelves, hospitals that had been cleaned and a public transport system that kept running. While some Australians were fortunate to work from home, many workers were not. Frontline and casual workers put their families' safety at risk to support our communities. Because casual workers can't earn a living wage, they work in multiple locations, including at multiple quarantine hotels during the pandemic. There are the aged-care transport workers. Many Australians put themselves on the line for low incomes to ensure that Australians are being looked after. How does this government thank them? By cutting their pay and conditions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This pandemic has reminded us that our actions affect those around us, that we have a responsibility to keep our fellow Australians safe and looked after. This government is not only ignoring this by allowing workers' pay and conditions to be cut, leaving families worse off and the economy worse off in its recovery, but also thanking frontline workers, who have so courageously served our communities, by cutting their pay and conditions. This bill allows wage cuts to be made and also makes it easier for wages to be stolen. The government has placed much weight on its rhetoric in here about increased penalties et cetera, but the detail in this bill means that the recovery of stolen wages is less likely, not more likely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note a submission signed by nine public health experts from the Australian National University. They have called this bill a threat to public health. The submission notes that Australia currently has one of the highest rates of individuals without leave entitlements in the OECD. Is the new OECD chief, Mathias Cormann, going to fix this? This bill increases the casualisation of work, the growing number of workers without paid sick leave. These experts state that casual workers' lack of sick leave is a threat to Australia's public health, because, whether they have the flu, COVID or whatever, they can't afford to take a day off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some 62 per cent of all jobs created between May and November 2020 were casual. The majority of jobs were casual. Casuals have fewer rights, fewer entitlements and less security. Casualisation is already an incredibly difficult and great issue in Australia. This bill doesn't fix it. This bill makes the problem worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is entitled the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill, yet it is very clear that the jobs it is supporting are jobs that are casual, insecure and make life more difficult for workers and our economic recovery. Our recovery is slow and will be inequitable with these changes. Some 23 labour law experts across Australia signed a submission warning that this bill leaves workers worse off. They contradict very clearly the government's claim that it will not facilitate pay cuts. Once again, this government has ignored academic experts. I don't have time today to go through all of the important detail in this bill, all of the examples, but the detail is there in the submissions from working people, academics, health experts, unions, the ACTU, migrant workers and a great many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to highlight an important issue in relation to greenfields agreements. The ETU's submission detailed the story of a worker, Robert, an electrical fitter mechanic and instrumentation technician. He worked on the Gorgon project on Barrow Island, a $53 billion project. He worked 29 days on, nine days off. It was tough, and he saw depression run wild through his workmates. At one point there was a run of suicides. One worker tried to take his own life on a flight home. The roster was the root of these issues, but it was locked in by the greenfields agreement which covered the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Gorgon project took a long time, but here we see an eight-year time line for greenfields projects. Mental health issues are rife, and it is morally wrong to have greenfields agreements with a lack of flexibility for up to eight years. Suicide clusters happen. Fourteen suicides were reported in connection with the INPEX project alone. I implore this place: the greenfields regime must be flexible enough to adapt to the evolving needs of a site. The amendments proposed in the bill do the exact opposite, locking in life-of-project agreements that in all likelihood, I believe, have the capacity to kill people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side strongly oppose this bill. The Labor Party is the party of working people. It always has been and it always will be. We will stand up to ensure that workers in our nation receive fair pay and conditions for the work that they do. We are the party of award safety nets, leave entitlements and secure work. The coalition is the party of cutting penalty rates, delaying rises to super and entrenching insecure work. The coalition is the party of Work Choices, union-busting bills and ensuring Australian workers do not get a fair go. This bill is just the latest attempt by this government to hurt working families. It will ensure that recovery from the pandemic is slow and inequitable. It's a story we've heard before: the coalition wanting to hurt workers, under the guise of economic improvement. The bill should not be passed in its current form. There are too many fundamental problems and all the risks fall one way: into the laps of working people. The coalition says that this bill will create confidence for employers to employ, but the risks all fall into the laps of working people. Here in this place we are defending workers from having their pay and conditions cut once again. The Labor Party will continue to fight to make sure that workers are treated fairly and that this bill does not pass.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  It's a pleasure to follow Senator Pratt, who laid out the Labor Party arguments on this Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021, which have been consistent for a number of months. Increasingly those arguments have actually been taken across Australia—and certainly across regional Queensland, where a number of unions have been out having meetings and talking to people. They've really been giving people the opportunity to understand the damage that this bill will do to their ability to go about their lives and their workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a bill that says so much about this government. It sums up how they operate, what they stand for and how they see life for Australian workers and families into the future. We can start with the name of the bill, 'supporting Australia's jobs and economic recovery'. It's always the cynical, political messaging with this government. They never miss an opportunity; it's politics all the time, and we see that with the title of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen it in the way that they've negotiated on this as well, and their positioning. They dropped getting rid of the better off overall test—the BOOT—during the first effort to get the bill passed. But they're prepared to use that to play on the fears of Australians, knowing full well that it was brought in around Work Choices the first time. Let's also think about this moment in time and look at what the world has been dealing with and going through over the last 12 months, then consider what Australians have been going through as well over this period of time. We know that hundreds of thousands of Australians have lost their jobs and that many of those have been relying on JobKeeper, which is due to expire in a couple of weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australians have a new-found sense of what an essential worker is through what we went through last year. Australians have appreciated those people who were able to provide the support so that many of us could get through, whether it was from frontline health workers—those people behind the scenes in health services who have helped to keep hospitals in shape and enabled us to deal with the pandemic—or those who have been on the frontline in supermarkets. We know how under pressure they've been. The last 12 months have certainly given Australians a new sense of what an essential worker is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill is the vision of this government. All it is is a series of ideological attacks—long-held beliefs that they've always wanted to pursue and have racked up under cover of dealing with the pandemic. That's what says so much about this government: the fact that they're pursuing long-held beliefs and agendas that they've always wanted to get on with in terms of attacking workers but wrapping these things up in terms of dealing with the pandemic. That is their cynical way of trying to get this through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the challenges that all workers are facing across the country were in place before the pandemic, such as increasing casualisation. We know that two million people were unemployed or looking for more work and that record low wage growth was well in place before the pandemic. And, sadly, from Queensland's point of view, there was the use of labour hire through many parts of Queensland, particularly through some industries. That's being used to drive down wages and conditions. We can then add onto these existing conditions the pandemic, and that's what the Australian people have been dealing with. But this bill is being presented today as this government's vision for a solution for those challenges that workers are facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so lacking in vision and it's bereft of any creativity from this government. They're incapable of offering up a better Australia. If this bill is the best they can put up then it's a sad indictment on this government that this is their vision for Australian workers. We actually had a moment, during what Australia went through over the last 12 months, when people did work together. The opposition were prepared to work with the government to try to find solutions to these challenges. Yet here we are, 12 months on, and Australia might have got through the pandemic but the government don't have a vision for what the future looks like. They don't have a vision for a better Australia, and all we see in this legislation is actually going to make things worse. It's going to make things worse for workers and it's going to make things worse for those families as a result of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those challenges I spoke about before—low wage growth, casualisation and people looking for work—were around before the pandemic. They've been accentuated now because of what we've been dealing with, but still the government shows no vision and no creativity. They just revert to the age-old attacks on workers that we've seen since the Howard days. It really is a tragedy that this is the best they can do, given the opportunity that they have had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does this bill do to hurt Australians? It makes it easier for employers to casualise jobs that would otherwise have been permanent. It makes bargaining for better pay and conditions more difficult than it already is. It allows for wage cuts. It weakens wage theft punishments in jurisdictions where wage theft has already been deemed a criminal act, like my home state of Queensland; this is something the state government has been really proud of delivering on, and was something that was seen as a significant factor in the recent election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to some of the evidence that was placed before the committee hearings. They were truncated committee hearings, because of the government's urgency on this, but it was a great job by Labor senators and others to get some of this evidence on the record. I know the committee spent time in Townsville as well, within Queensland. According to the Centre for Future Work:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has not experienced such a sustained deceleration of both nominal and real wages in its entire post-war history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National government's plan to get wages growing again is to make it easier to casualise workers. The Senate economics committee looked into the government's bill and heard from workers and other groups. Included in this was the Centre for Future Work, who said that weakening casual labour definitions and increasing employer control over these definitions will suppress wage growth and fuel insecure work:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The worrying expansion of insecure work in Australia is already associated with major economic and social consequences, including the slowest wage growth at any point since the Depression, undermined consumption spending, rising household financial instability, and rising inequality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was furthered by Per Capita:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Bill is likely to exacerbate, rather than relieve, the insecurity of hours and income experienced by too many workers in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At its worst interpretation, the new definition and conversion clause could encourage employers to offer casual employment to all new employees, giving them a year of 'try before you buy' employment for all employees, regardless of the eventual hours worked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly important given that the growth in employment has been on the back of casual work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixty per cent of all jobs created between May and November last year were casual work, according to the Centre for Future Work. In this period, casual employment grew by 400,000 jobs. Similarly, part-time work has also grown strongly in the same period. Australia's COVID recovery can't be built on the back of more insecure work, and this bill is going to make that worse. It won't improve conditions for casuals. The government even overturned the Federal Court decision on what it means to be a casual, making it harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these laws, if someone starts a job and agrees to be employed as a casual they remain a casual regardless of their actual work hours and patterns, as long as the employer employs them on the basis that they make no firm advance commitment to continuing in indefinite work according to an agreed pattern of work. Even if a court finds that a casual worker should be permanent, any casual loading they have received is deducted from outstanding permanent entitlements. So they still find a way to punish workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are countless examples of workers doing the same job but being paid less—30 per cent to 40 per cent less on average, it is being reported, than their permanent counterparts. We've seen numerous examples of that in Queensland through the resourcing industry. Not only are they getting less than their full-time counterparts; they will not get what is owed to them even if they are found to be permanent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does very little to address the permanent-casual problem, something that is rife throughout Queensland and regional Queensland. The provisions don't offer a realistic pathway to permanency, with a loophole of potentially unlimited reasonable grounds that employees will not be able to challenge. The ACTU called the provisions 'essentially meaningless', given that employers are not bound to offer permanency if they do not think it is reasonable and can also refuse to consent to arbitration before the Fair Work Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a key part of this, particularly from a Queensland point of view, because we have seen this become prevalent throughout regional Queensland. I've spoken about this in the chamber before because, ultimately, what this is doing is driving down the pay and conditions of all workers. But it's also changing the nature of many of these regional towns in terms of regional Queensland being a good place to live, work and raise a family. If the only employment you can rely on is casual, you aren't able to make the same decisions in life as others who have full-time or permanent work. It is changing the nature of these places and making them less attractive for people to live, work, and raise a family as generations of Queenslanders and, indeed, Australians have done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the simplified additional hours agreement. This provision means an employer and a part-time employee can agree to the employee working additional hours at their normal pay rate without the employer paying overtime. The Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union stated there has been a proliferation of part-time employees who are being treated as casual employees whilst negating the need to pay the 25 per cent loading required for casual employees. It argued: 'Effectively, the employee has limited control over hours worked and loses the benefits of part-time employment. Whilst the employer gains flexibility and reduced hourly rates, expansion of part-time employment practices by employers will further exacerbate insecurity and precarious employment.' The Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union obviously covers so many vital workers, particularly given the health crisis that we have been dealing with over the last 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also weaken wage theft laws in Queensland. The Queensland Council of Unions said in their evidence that the bill considers the penalty for stealing by a worker to be 2½ times worse than stealing by an employer. In contrast, wage theft in Queensland is set at the same corresponding penalty if the stealing is conducted by a clerk or servant in relation to the employer's property. The Queensland government has criticised the wage theft changes. Queensland has a maximum penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment, whereas the Commonwealth regime has a maximum of only four. The Queensland government said in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The setting of a lower penalty at the Commonwealth level appears to signal that the Commonwealth Government regards wage theft as a less serious act than, for example, the forgery of postage stamps (which attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that shows the attitude to wage theft of this government, which has been its attitude for years, despite the overwhelming evidence that has been presented for Australian workers being ripped off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and Australian workers need an economic recovery that benefits all. Labor believes that we need to promote inclusive prosperity, where we create wealth through improved job security and decent wages. Per Capita summarised Australia's recovery well:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite a strong recovery in asset prices and a falling headline unemployment rate towards the end of 2020, the reality is that Australia's broader economic recovery threatens to take the shape of a 'K' rather than a 'V': that is, some people will do very well, having retained their jobs and saved money during the lock-downs last year, while others will fall deeper into insecurity and poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of this bill that we are debating today is that it will make that worse. Labor has been consistent since this bill was first introduced that this is bad legislation and it needs to be voted down, and that is what Labor will do. But more than that, it is such a missed opportunity for the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when Australians are actually looking for a better vision, looking for something to look forward to that offers hope for their future, the government have turned up and put forward this bill that is going to make Australians and their families worse off. It is a sad indictment on this government that this is the best they can do, but they are so lacking in vision, they are so lacking in creativity, that this bill has to be opposed. I encourage the crossbench to oppose it as well. There is nothing that can be done to improve this. It is something that needs to be voted down, and the Australian people need to punish this government at the next election. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia’s Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021 and I state at the outset that the first thing that should be front of mind for most Australian people is that, when the Liberal-National government set out to tell workers that they've got their back and that this fantastic piece of legislation is in the best interests of Australian workers and is going to improve their lifestyle, the warning bells and the alarms should be screaming at fever pitch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember sitting in this chamber back in 2005 on the day Work Choices went through. The Howard government had the numbers in the Senate, in their own right, to ram through any legislation, and they did—and weren't they proud! I also remember a clap of lightning hitting this place—true as I speak. There was a little bit of sunlight shining through on Senator Abetz's head at the time, and I remember wondering if that shard of light would turn into a lightning bolt one day. Well, how did that end up for the coalition? What coalition member couldn't stand proud and tell us during the Work Choices legislation debates and when the subsequent bill hit the streets that they were so proud of the Howard government for doing that? I even saw a couple of them doing high fives, slapping each other's hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing about being in this place is that you know history does repeat itself. Here we go again. Regardless of the bad behaviour we've seen in this place—the cover-ups and the alleged offences in the last few years that would make any decent Australian want to vomit—what do they do as soon as there's a pandemic? They can't help themselves; it's in their ideological DNA. I heard the contributions of a couple of senators yesterday, one of whom was Senator Small from WA, and I did read some comments on Facebook—and I'm not going to be so rude as to mention anything about his name and his capability; I wouldn't dare do that—telling us that this is not ideological. Bulldust! This is ideological. I'll tell you why. If the government over there, any of those Liberal or Nationals senators, had a shred of decency in them they would be telling the Australian people, while they're telling them what a magnificent job of looking after people they're doing with this piece of legislation, what they have done for Australian workers in the last seven years they've been in government. I'll make it easy for them: just name three things that would have Australian workers standing up saying, 'What a magnificent job the Liberal-National coalition have done!' Not one of them can do that, because they would get torn to shreds. What have they done for their mates in big business? That would read like a Funk &amp; Wagnalls; that would be 26 or 27 volumes. And here we go again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking about history, I want to send a message to my crossbench colleagues. I do respect the crossbench; I am one of those who absolutely respects the crossbench. Even though we have differences of opinion, they were elected in their own right. They have faced the people and they have been sent by their respective states to represent the good people of those states. I say to Senator Lambie, Senator Patrick, Senator Griff, Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts: the last time we saw a wonderful—and I've got my tongue in my cheek—piece of legislation to 'help' working men and women in Australia, the crossbench senators who supported that bill are no longer here. There could be myriad reasons why, but I've got to tell you, Senators, the biggest thing going into the 2007 election was Work Choices. The Howard government, with all the lemmings on the other side and the crossbenchers who supported them, couldn't wait to put it in. They all went out the exit door. They're not here anymore. I appeal to the crossbench senators not to fall for it—no matter how those opposite fluff it up, no matter how many hundreds and thousands they sprinkle on this horrible sandwich—because the Australian people will not be taken for mugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know one of the greatest issues this nation faces is wage theft. This is not new to me. I've been talking about wage theft for many, many years. I'm really happy now that the media are actually talking about wage theft. I want to congratulate those two magnificent Labor state governments in Queensland and Victoria, who not only talked about wage theft but moved heaven and earth to bring in legislation to address the issue. When will it ever happen in this place? Never. I shouldn't ask myself the same questions. It's never going to happen. I have been running around the great nation of Australia talking to truck drivers left, right and centre—not just to the suits and the representatives of transport associations. Senators opposite, if you want to have a bubble, bring it up now; give me examples of where I might be wrong. All they want to talk about—they want to talk about many, many things, but the biggest issue is wage theft. What really irks people is that mob over there. They pretend to be the friends of small business. This is the nonsense you'll hear from the LNP: 'We're the party of small business.' Well, if you are the party of small business, please explain to me how we have small businesses in this day and age that are getting the living daylights screwed out of them by the top of the supply chain. Nothing in this bill goes to addressing that. What about all those magnificent, hardworking small businesses in every industry you could think of who are being told to sharpen their pencil every time they put a quote in. They are being told, 'We can't pay you in 30 days. We might pay you in 45. We might even pay you in 60.' I have examples of 120. I have examples of 150, but that was one of the multinationals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, LNP senators, tell me what you've done for small business in this nation in terms of getting them remunerated on time or in a reasonable time. LNP senators, it's crickets over there. Not a thing! Also, where in this nation do we have a body called the Fair Work Ombudsman? The Fair Work Ombudsman is charged with a number of things. One is to seek out those people who aren't doing the right thing in paying their wages. Where in this bill—please point me to it—does it even say that thou shalt fund the Fair Work Ombudsman, let alone have it get out there and prosecute people and put them behind bars if it has to, or whatever it needs to do, to recuperate hard-earned moneys for people who have not been paid properly? I gave examples of that in this place two or three weeks ago. Please tell me where in the bill it tells me that you're going to address this in order to look after workers? As expected, there is not a thing. I'm giving you the opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have examples of high-profile businesses self-reporting, and good on them. They've self-reported and come out and said, 'Look, we haven't paid our people properly.' And I can understand that sometimes there could be bogies in computers and all that. I get all that. We have celebrity chefs and we have Bunnings. These are people—not the celebrity chefs but the likes of Bunnings—who normally do pay, but there has been a slip-up. They've fixed it. That's fine; that's great. We heard that Maurice Blackburn had done it. They got out there and fixed it. When the grand party of the small business stand ups and says, 'You know what? Every time we give the opportunity for an employer to do the wrong thing and not get pinged,' where in your psyche do you think to yourselves, 'But what about the poor people that are doing the right thing?' Point me to the clause in this bill that says that you will do your best to look after the people who are paying the correct wages but are losing contracts to people who absolutely engage in wage theft and superannuation theft? Is there anything there? No, I didn't think so. You can't point me to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened intently to a number of contributions today. One of the best contributions I heard was from Senator O'Neill, who was on the committee. A legislation committee looked into this bill. I've done a few committees myself over the years. I heard Senator O'Neill tell me very clearly that the government—not the opposition and the crossbench and the Greens—only let them have three hearings. This is a massive bill that is going to be so fantastic for Australian businesses, so fantastic for Australian workers, so fantastic for casuals, so fantastic for those that have insecure employment now! There were three days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made a couple of contributions in here in the last couple of weeks about how disgusted I am in the modus operandi of this LNP government. In the last seven years they have done everything they can to not answer questions in the inquiries. They get the departments not to answer. And—lo and behold—it happened again to me last week when I was conducting the inquiry into the Transport Security Amendment (Serious Crime) Bill 2020. It was the same old same old: 'We'll insult the Senate. We'll insult the senators.' That's fine; you'll get away with that for a while. But you insulted the witnesses who had travelled and who wanted to come and present their cases. You, the LNP Morrison government, are all guilty, the whole lot of you together, of sitting back and thinking that you could control it and that there would be only three hearings. Last time I looked, there were about six or seven capital cities that we would normally go to to seek that information from the people. Then I heard the example from Senator O'Neill of the nurses who had travelled. There might have been one nurse or a couple of nurses; I apologise if I've got that wrong. They were most upset that they couldn't get to present their take on insecure employment and their take on the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator O'Neill said very clearly, our frontline workers were the ones that ministers and the Prime Minister couldn't wait to get their photos taken with. They were standing next to the nurses, standing next to the healthcare workers, standing next to our essential workers fighting the pandemic. Senator O'Neill described when a nurse had to say to her husband and kids, 'If it breaks out, I might not be able to come home for a month.' The LNP senators—I don't know who the LNP senators were on the inquiry; I'm blaming the whole damn lot of them because they're all guilty through association. Where in your psyche do you think it's fantastic that you can snub the Australian people on the one hand, while on the other hand telling them you're doing everything you can to look after them? I know no-one on that side is going to answer that. I know there are Labor senators who are going to answer that, and Greens senators and crossbenchers who can answer that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's another one—casualisation. Before they all start jumping up like a pack of cockies carrying on, casual work suits certain employees. But I've got to tell you, as someone who didn't slither my way through university while I was trying to figure out how I could work for someone and then get a job in the Senate or as a member of parliament without actually going off to work and doing things, when you are casual there is no way known you can seek a loan. You cannot get a loan for a car. You can't do it. You certainly can't get a loan for a house. How do I know? Because I have spent many, many years—I broke every industrial law in the land I could find, and I am proud of it. I marched truck drivers and forklift drivers and loaders off the job in the good old days, when workers could collectively bargain, before Howard got his claws in there with the support of all the lemmings behind him, to proudly stand on picket lines and proudly make it known to anyone around, 'We ain't moving until our brothers and sisters have got permanent jobs.' I'm so proud of my history there. I just wish I could have spent the last 15 years doing it as well, but I've been in here trying to fight the good fight for workers. So, in this bill, you point me to where any worker can say, 'Thank you LNP, thank you Mr Morrison and the lemmings; you have got my back.' What a load of bull.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another part here I want to find out about. One of my greatest hatreds in the transport industry—and I'll let other senators talk about this—was, and still is, labour hire. I might be wrong; labour hire may now have a conscience. But back in the great old days, when I had the steelcap boots and jeans on, there was not one decent word that I could put my tongue around to describe or link to labour hire. Labour hire were the parasites of the road transport industry. If it's changed, come and see me. Labour hire: the preferred option for the multinationals and everyone else who wanted to screw down wages and conditions. Do you know why I hated them? They never invested one single cent into the welfare of the workforce. Show me one single cent in the transport industry that labour hire put towards training and skills development. It ain't going to happen because it never happened. Give me one example where labour hire said: 'Gee whiz! We're making a motza, so how can we pay our labour hire people on a multinational site the EBA rates of pay that the permanent employees get on those sites, or the casuals?' Guess what? Chameleons. The labour hire mob could blend in with the jungle because they were never responsible. They never did anything for anyone except for themselves, except for helping bosses screw down the working conditions and wages of their permanent and their casual staff. Please point me in the direction of whatever page, of whatever paragraph that proves me wrong, shows where this bill is so darn good for working men and women in Australia?</span>

This is one of the principal reasons political discourse in this country has degenerated to such appallingly low standards. This must change. We, Australians, are better than this. Last night I posted on Twitter the powerful, emotional speech by the member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint, who has called out the Labor Party, GetUp and the unions over the most disgusting campaign against her at the last federal election. Much of this was facilitated through an unceasing barrage of false, misogynistic, abusive and of course defamatory publications on Twitter, cowardly anonymous posts which are beyond the reach of Australian law. Even my post last night was met with more abusive and defamatory comments.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition said this morning on ABC radio that he stood by Ms Flint at this time, yet it was Senator Wong who was leading the charge on behalf of Labor in its campaign against Ms Flint. These are weasel words from the Leader of the Opposition and from Labor. This is an issue above politics. Every woman deserves to feel safe when she goes to work, no matter where she works. The Morrison government's response to the distressing allegations by Brittany Higgins, including the commissioning of an independent review into Commonwealth workplaces by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins, is well underway.</span>

However, in this contribution, I want to focus on the urgent need for social media defamation law reform in Australia. Every Australian deserves to feel safe online, no matter how they engage, whether it be connected with work, family, friends, shopping or leisure. The global digital platforms have an ugly history of showing scant regard for the material they publish. Currently, social media companies cannot be held responsible for content they publish because, under schedule 5 of the Broadcasting Services Act, they are not considered as hosting the content in Australia. This is purely because their web servers are located overseas. This is untenable. It is a matter of common sense and law that these companies publish content in Australia, but because their web servers are located overseas they currently cannot be held liable for what they publish, no matter how defamatory it is. In the meantime, peoples' reputations can be ruined by a single viral post, a barrage of online abuse, a misleading photo or a quote taken out of context. All of these continue to be published in Australia by companies like Facebook and Twitter without any legal repercussions for this defamation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unacceptable that social media giants have, for so long, evaded responsibility for the content they publish. This cavalier approach to the lives and reputations of ordinary Australians must be stopped. It is time to reform defamation law in this country. Such reform would build on the Morrison government's strong commitment to combating online abuse, such as our children's online safety reforms and the Online Safety Bill, which combats violent, abusive and other similar material.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also passed world-leading legislation to ensure that Google and Facebook pay for the Australian news content they use in this country. However, it is clear that if left to their own devices these global giants will do everything they can to escape liability for content they publish, even if it means recklessly exposing Australians to the ravages of online defamation. The hypocrisy of these companies is galling. Facebook and Twitter routinely block or take down posts they consider to be politically controversial or offensive but will continue to publish defamatory posts long after the affected person has notified them and lodged a complaint, or after a court has issued a warrant for the post to be taken down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last May I informed the Senate about two anonymous Twitter accounts that, over three years, posted vile, abusive and defamatory content about me. I detailed how I believe that the current member for Corangamite had some direct or indirect control over one of those accounts, and her subsequent denials are simply not credible. These posts included false and defamatory claims that I was guilty of—</span>

                  </a>  First, I would say to the senator that the fact that an objection was not made previously is no answer to a ruling now. Second—and I would say this to the minister, too—regardless of who is in the chair, if a senator is asked to withdraw, the convention is that the senator complies. I would invite the government minister to encourage the senator to comply. If the senator fails to comply then, obviously, the option for the Acting Deputy President is to report the matter to the President, but I would really encourage the government senator, Senator Henderson, not to go down this path. We all have to withdraw at times; I've withdrawn lots of things over many years!</span>

                  </a>  Yes, I withdraw it and I'll simply say that I'm referring to false and defamatory claims in relation to two anonymous Twitter accounts, including claims that I was guilty of embezzlement and going to jail. In these Twitter accounts there was a doctored image of a mug shot. It was of another woman bearing the same name as me, who had shot dead her children in Texas, but the image was of my face. These were my political opponents at work and it was absolutely sickening and disgusting. Victoria Police is investigating this matter on the basis that these anonymous Twitter accounts constitute stalking under the Crimes Act. But, to date, police have been unable to access any identifying material about these accounts, because Twitter refuses to cooperate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On application by Geelong detectives, the Geelong Magistrates Court issued a warrant on 10 July 2020 demanding that Twitter hand over relevant documents. On 2 September, Twitter declined to accept the warrant, saying that police must seek information through the International Cooperation in Criminal Matters Mutual Legal Assistance process in the courts of Ireland and the United States. Twitter refuses to cooperate. This makes a mockery of Twitter's assurances to me by their Australian representative Kara Hinesley that it would cooperate if a court or legal order were obtained.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This makes justice for ordinary Australians impossible. These companies don't care about publishing defamatory content, which may also be in breach of the criminal law, because it usually affects individuals who have neither the time nor the money to contest the matter in court, let alone in an international court. The companies know that under Australian law they cannot be held liable for the publication of the defamatory content anyway. That's why regulatory reform is needed to restore fairness and justice online for ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reform will be difficult and complex, because Australian law is limited in its capacity to bind foreign corporations operating overseas. But this reform is possible, and must happen, as we have done with abusive and harmful content published online. Some may argue that stronger regulation of these companies' online publishing undermines free speech, but our right to free speech does not justify the publication of defamatory material. No-one thinks it's a fair concession to free speech to allow the social media giants to escape liability, having actively participated in the ruination of someone's life and reputation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some may argue social media companies really don't host content in Australia because the internet is a global phenomenon that transcends national borders. If that's the case, why is it that, whenever they are brought before the courts, Twitter says its servers are all in California and Facebook maintains its data centre is in Dublin? It seems these companies are very eager to confine the internet within national borders whenever it suits them. The fact is that companies like Facebook and Twitter publish content in Australia, run advertising in Australia, conduct business in Australia and derive significant income in Australia. They also take advantage of legal loopholes in Australia. These loopholes should and must be eliminated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I've got a good news story, so I'm looking forward to my contribution. I'm sorry I've only got 10 minutes; I could go all day on this. I want to talk about a magnificent project that's come out of Western Australia. Amazing things happen when industry and employer groups get together and start talking in one voice and singing from the same hymn sheet. So was the case with two very good close friends of mine: Timmy Dawson—nicknamed 'Smokey', like most Dawsons—secretariat of the Transport Workers Union Western Australia; and Cam Dumesny, CEO of the Western Roads Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back some time last year, just after COVID restrictions were lifted and we could start travelling through Western Australia again, 'Smokey' and I jumped in the car and headed up north, because there had been a lot of reports about the poor quality of rest areas for our heavy-vehicle drivers. The one I mainly wanted to see was what they colloquially term the road train assembly area in Newman, which is code for 'an absolute pigsty and should be condemned'—anyway, that was my view. We went up and had a look. We spoke to a lot of truck drivers. It's been many years since I've pulled into a rest area up north to spend the night, but, going back to the days when I was on the road with my mates, it was not uncommon to pull into a dirt truck bay. If it was raining, I guarantee you'd lose a thong—it would snap off—or you'd be up to your ankles in mud. If you wanted to go to the toilet, you had to make sure it was in between showers—this is not a pleasant conversation to have, but it's the truth—and take a torch, whack a roll of toilet paper under your arm, and go off into the bush and hope to crikey you came out alright. And we wondered why we couldn't attract women into the transport industry! Since then there has been a lot of work done to get these rest areas and truck bays equivalent to how they should be, fit for purpose, in 2021, when truckies can be treated like humans when they have to pull up and have a rest or relieve themselves. More importantly we want to have the best working conditions to get women into the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time I wrote to the Premier of Western Australia, Mark McGowan, and strongly advised him that he could do worse than sit down and talk with the industry, and sit down and talk with Timmy Dawson and Cam Dumesny. To his credit, he did that. Out of that came a magnificent project where 17 targeted locations were identified. I commend Minister Rita Saffioti, the Minister for Transport and Planning, in working with the industry and with Main Roads, her department. And I want to congratulate David Fyfe, from the Western Australia Livestock and Rural Transport Association; he is a magnificent representative for his members in the transport industry. They identified these projects and came to the conclusion that there is a bucket of money—and I give credit to the Commonwealth government, who provides that bucket of money back to the states—with which they can go and upgrade these areas, which is fantastic. For those of us from WA, we should be excited about it. It's been a long time coming but it's coming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This $14 million package will provide ablution facilities at 10 locations on key freight routes, including near Bunbury, which is down south; Northam, to the east; Port Hedland, in the north; Northampton, in the north; Exmouth, in the north; Wubin, just north of Perth, which is the massive road train assembly area—that takes me back about 20 years, maybe longer, when I was leading the campaign to get it bituminised so that our truckies didn't have to run around in mud while dropping off their trailers or picking up their third trailer or backing dollies up. That's now going to be targeted. It's long overdue for expansion. It has got toilets and showers. It's great to hear it is going to get more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It includes Marble Bar as well. Those of us from WA would know why Marble Bar has been included. Marble Bar is a hotspot of activity with the mines. The two most popular configurations we see in Western Australia north of Newman and out in the Goldfields especially are triple road trains and quads, which are the monsters that pull the iron ore from the mines to the ports. They're running along with four trailers. That's serious weight. I think it's up around 220 or 230 tonnes. You wouldn't want one of those running over your foot with a thong on. That is good news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank goodness there is also the expansion of the Newman road train assembly area and new ablution facilities. That is $6 million. I congratulate the industry bodies and the Western Australian government and I thank the Commonwealth government for giving us that bucket of money, but there's a little bit of shame here for BHP. I never let an opportunity go by. We talk about Newman. For those who don't know, Newman used to be called Mount Newman. It is one of the first places where iron ore kicked off. There is the huge Mount Whaleback. BHP are a huge exporter of our rock, the Australian people's minerals. A heck of a lot of money comes in and out of Newman. The sad part is that I didn't see BHP put their hand in their pocket. I did ask them, but that was like talking to a brick wall. So no kudos for BHP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">BHP talk about being the big Australian. They're not Australian. They talk about how many employment opportunities they give. That's great. It's tremendous that they give those employment opportunities to a lot of Australians, particularly in my home state, where a lot of the wealth comes from. But they do not make the top of the box, in my view. They don't go past their gates. Their truckies live like they did in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. They walk around in dirt and have no toilets. BHP don't give a damn. Anyway, well done to the others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also at Leonora the sealing and extension of parking and the provision of toilet facilities to the tune of $1½ million. That's fantastic. There's also the sealing of an existing parking area near Karijini to separate heavy vehicles and light vehicles. That is tremendous. We encourage people in Western Australia to get out and about and have a look around. We're asking people to hook up their caravan or camper trailer or to hire a Winnebago. We have to remember that out on these highways the tourists are mixing with some big kit. There are a lot of movements around the north and eight-metre wide loads are the norm. There's no doubt about that. The last time I looked the width of the road was about five metres, and that's both lanes. So you can understand we need to increase these facilities and do our best to increase the infrastructure up there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What also excites me a bit is the one roadhouse between Newman and Port Hedland. From memory, for about 440 or 450 kays—don't hold me to it—there's just one roadhouse: Auski. Auski is where a lot of the truckies and the tourists pull up. You can get a good feed at the Auski. I know because I've been there a number of times. You can get a shower. Auski supply some facilities. They ask for a gold coin donation. You don't have to. That's great for the truckies. The only pitfall is that the massive parking area for the triples, the big stuff and the overwidth stuff coming in is dirt with massive potholes that you could fall in or lose a prime mover in. That's going to be sealed as part of this deal. That is a magnificent thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm on this, I encourage any program on our freight routes for our drivers but also any program that makes things as friendly and welcoming as possible for families. In a lot of these areas there's only one road in and out—you may have two if you're lucky. We want to encourage Australians to see Western Australia. I encourage every Australian. If you get the opportunity—and we all love jumping on a plane and heading to Bali or somewhere else—go and see Australia. Come to the west and come up to the north-west—it's a magnificent part of the world; it is God's country—but remember that you are mixing with some big gear up there. If we can also provide facilities and decent roadhouses for tourists with fuelling facilities and playgrounds, it would be even better. The truckies would welcome it. Everyone is welcome in the west. We just want everyone to be safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this with the greatest respect: I sincerely thank both governments, Commonwealth and state. I thank Minister Saffioti for not only listening but doing something. Once again, to Timmy Dawson, Cam Dumesny and David Fyfe: you really are champions for the industry. Thank you, guys. But we can't stop there. There is a lot more that needs to be done. We should not be looking at this great project as a one-off. This is something that needs to be an ongoing thing. The trucking industry is a great cash cow for any government. They take a lot of money out of the truckies' pockets in all forms of taxation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm at it, I'll mention that the Tasmanians have done a great job down there talking to industry; I thought I'd just throw that in because I saw Senator Whish-Wilson. They've listened to truckies. They've listened to the transport industry. Congratulations down there. That's brilliant. As for the other states—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I'm standing in the Australian Senate today and I'm doing a shout-out to the King Island District High School Green Team and their Little Busters and Power Rangers programs. I love you guys. You're absolute legends. Keep changing the world. These guys, the King Island District High School Green Team—their teacher Duncan McPhee, I think, has been a power behind a number of these initiatives—are a student based, staff supported organisation with the aspiration to make a difference in our world by inspiring a greener and more sustainable way of life. Their role is to educate current and future generations on their island and promote change and develop ideas. They enjoy collaborating with staff, members of the council and other community organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of 2019, all used bottles and glass in King Island were going to landfill, so the Green Team got together and focused on the question: how is waste managed on King Island and how can it be better managed? They began a quest with a fact-finding mission at local waste management sites. After a group meeting, the team visited the council and presented their thoughts and ideas to senior council staff and later to a full council meeting. Following this meeting, with the assistance of the council, the Green Team developed a sticker to be placed on bins and developed a campaign aimed at getting the community to separate glass at home and then drop it at the transfer centre. At this meeting, the council agreed to purchase glass collection bins and continue to collaborate with the Green Team. The end result of this is that King Island glass is now being crushed and used on the island. As of June 2020, over 83,000 bottles had been crushed. The King Island Green Team have also placed radio advertisements about the initiatives they're doing and the need for better waste initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Little Busters is a campaign set up to educate students and their parents about the importance of reducing litter in the environment. The campaign is up and running, including beach clean-ups up and down the coast. Lastly, Power Rangers is a program aimed to educate students about the importance of reducing power consumption at home so they can educate their parents and help them to pay lower power bills. Here is an example of one primary school that is changing the world. I know kids do great jobs all around this country, but they are change agents. They can change their parents and they can change the world. Well done, guys. I'm really proud of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the second story that I want to talk about today is not a positive story. It's been brought to my attention in recent weeks, by very distraught and desperate community members on the north coast of Tasmania, that, particularly around Smithton, Montagu and Marrawah, there have been some totally shocking and unacceptable deaths of Tasmanian devils. In the last three days, three more devils have been found dead on the roads around the Woolnorth property. It's really important to put this in perspective. Tasmanian devil populations have declined 80 per cent in the last two decades, and the last healthy devil population that is tumour free is in the north-west, in this area. There have been 14 devils found dead on the roads in just the last week in this area, and nearly 30 Tasmanian devils since January. This population can't afford to lose these numbers and the community are getting desperate—and, of course, they're desperately sad, because they're the ones who collect the devils and hand them in for pathology to the local Save the Tasmanian Devil Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very confronting, but I feel like I have to do this. I have a number of photographs here of dead Tasmanian devils. Each and every one of them were individuals in a healthy population and they can't be replaced. They can't speak for themselves; we have to speak for them, so I seek leave to table these seven photographs of Tasmanian devils.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="195565" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WHISH-WILSON:</span>
                  </a>  It's no good just coming into the Senate and making a statement that this is horrific without providing a way of changing this and a way to go forward. The Save the Tasmanian Devil Program was a joint initiative between state and federal governments. Unfortunately, the federal government pulled its funding for this initiative in 2017. No money is going from the federal government towards a species which is listed under EPBC law as threatened, endangered and protected. It's simply not good enough. In this area and in this community there are no mitigation measures to help protect devils from becoming roadkill. Obvious and simple measures could be taken. I've talked to the local government, I've written to Tasmanian agencies and I'll be writing to our federal environment minister, urging her to put money into the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This area in Woolnorth doesn't even have signs letting tourists, locals or people travelling through there know that it's a critical area of Tasmanian devil habitat. Devils face enormous pressure in this area from illegal land clearing as well as pollution—on-farm pollution and a whole range of other predations. But to have nearly 40 killed in a short space of time on the roads, when we know there are things we can do, is unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just on the other side of the Arthur River in the north-west is the Tarkine Drive. When that area was built and paved for the road just over a decade ago, a number of mitigation measures were put in place to help protect the devils, based on extensive studies of devil populations in the area. These were things like speed signs slowing traffic to 30 kilometres an hour in areas where devils are known; corrugations on the road to make noise alerting devils; and white areas on the road so that motorists could see the devils. There's devil-proof fencing in that area and a whole range of other initiatives that were taken to protect the devil. Even a mine site which was approved in that area by the federal government let the mine know that for every dead devil which was found to be killed by their trucks it was going to cost them $58,000. Personally, I don't think you could put a price on the life of a Tasmanian devil, but at least the company knew that there was an incentive there to be very careful and to make sure that their workers were educated about the need to drive slowly and be very careful about the Tasmanian devils. But just a few kilometres away, on the other side of the river, there's nothing. There's a gravel road and a sealed road but no mitigation measures at all. This is not acceptable and it has to change. I know that the local government wants to put in place more devil-proof fencing and I know that the community is happy to help with removing roadkill from the roads—that's another thing that's very important, so that devils don't go onto the road and get hit by trucks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by saying that the largest dairy farm in Australia, Van Diemen's Land, is in that area. The road where all these dead devils are found surrounds Van Dairy and their properties. When this property was purchased by a foreign investor in 2016-17, part of their undertakings to the federal government—to our Prime Minister at the time—was that they would put money into measures to mitigate the risks to Tasmanian devils. They haven't. In fact, I'd like to read from a statement on their website:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Van Dairy has a thriving and healthy population of the endangered Tasmanian Devil, and our properties also include some nesting sites for the magnificent Wedge Tail Eagle. We are working actively with the Tasmanian Government to protect these and other native animals that share our land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've come to know the locals very well in this area, and they tell me there have been no mitigation measures taken at all. That doesn't surprise me, because Van Dairy also pledged to the Australian people that they would invest $100 million to upgrade infrastructure on their farms, a better effluent system to deal with untreated effluent which is causing, I understand—I have commented on it recently in the Tasmanian newspapers—pollution issues in this sensitive area of devil habitat, just a kilometre away from the ICUN recognised Boullanger Bay/Robbins Passage wetlands. It is the most important shorebird habitat in Tasmania. These are very sensitive areas, and we have to do better in managing development and other activity in them, such as we've seen at Van Dairy. I would ask the owners of Van Dairy to put their money where their mouth is—to put money into the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program—and start helping out like they promised the Tasmanian and Australian people they would.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  Recently I spoke about Tasmania's first power couple, Joe and Dame Enid Lyons. Today I want to acknowledge another Tasmanian family who have also contributed an enormous amount to our political history, the Hodgman family. Initially I'll focus on the two most prominent members of that, both political leaders in their own right who made significant contributions to my own state. At one time, not that long ago, Michael and Will Hodgman served together in the Tasmanian state parliament; however, this father-son duo will be remembered mostly as champions of Tasmania.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noted as 'one of the most colourful figures in modern Australian politics' by former prime minister Julia Gillard and as 'one of the greatest characters in Australian politics' by Senator David Bushby, Michael Hodgman left a lasting legacy. He was a passionate advocate for Tasmania at a state and federal level and a vocal supporter of Australia's constitutional monarchy. In 2018, Will Hodgman received the highest number of votes for any candidate in a Tasmanian state election. I've had the pleasure of knowing and working with Will over many years and have always valued his counsel and support. He was a longstanding member of the Tasmanian parliament, and the state grew in national and international standing under his stewardship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">William Michael Hodgman AM, QC was born in Hobart in 1938. He enjoyed a successful legal career before moving into politics. He graduated with a Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Tasmania in 1962, serving as Vice-President of the Tasmania University Law Society and editor of the university newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">Togatus</span>, whilst studying in Hobart. Michael was admitted to the Supreme Court of Tasmania and served as an associate to the Rt Hon. Sir Victor Windeyer of the High Court of Australia from 1962 to 1963. He worked as a legal officer for Hydro Tasmania in 1965 and 1966 and served as a committee member of the Tasmanian Bar Council between 1964 and 1974. Michael was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1984. One aspect of life outside politics that he'll be remembered most for was his high-profile clientele, including the infamous Mark 'Chopper' Read.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael's introduction to politics came in 1966, when he won the seat of Huon as an independent member of Tasmania's Legislative Council. He held this position until December 1975, when he was elected to the federal parliament. As the federal MP for Denison between 1975 and July 1987, Michael served as the Minister for the Capital Territory and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce. After losing his federal seat at the 1987 election, Michael re-entered the Tasmanian parliament in 1992, becoming the member for Denison in the House of Assembly. He held this seat until 1998 and then again between 2002 and 2010, which is when his political service coincided with his son Will's. In fact, Michael was in the party room when Will was elected unopposed as the new Liberal leader in 2006.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the time Michael retired from politics, in 2010, he had spent 44 years serving Tasmanians and Australians, with 35 years of those years in parliament. My brother, former Senator Bushby, paid tribute to this service in federal parliament, affectionately calling Michael 'the mouth from the south', a term commonly used to describe him. In his speech, David explained:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is much that can be said of Michael—his time in public office; his passion for Tasmania, for Hobart, for regional Australia, for the law; his antics, his stunts, his legendary rhetoric; and his loyalty to our sovereign, Her Majesty the Queen of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Michael's death in 2013, a state memorial service was held in Hobart. Julia Gillard paid tribute to Michael, placing parliament's appreciation for his long and meritorious public service on the record. She said all members would mourn his loss. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Will Hodgman followed in his father's footsteps in wanting to serve Tasmanians and Australians. Now Australia's High Commissioner to Singapore, Will was Tasmania's 45th Premier until he resigned in January last year. William Edward Felix 'Will' Hodgman was born in 1969 in Hobart and, like his father, was educated at The Hutchins School and attended the University of Tasmania. Will graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Law in 1993 and was admitted to the Supreme Court of Tasmania in 1994. Will was initially an associate of Hobart law firm Wallace Wilkinson &amp; Webster, before travelling to the UK and working as a solicitor for the Wiltshire county council. In this role he acted as prosecutor and advocate for the council in the county courts and the High Court of Justice. Returning to Tasmania and his work at Wallace Wilkinson &amp; Webster in 1998, Will practised criminal and personal injury law until he was elected to the Tasmanian parliament in 2002. He served as the member for Franklin in the House of Assembly until 2020. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Will took up the mantle of opposition leader in 2006 and became Tasmanian Premier following the 2014 state election. Winning 23,589 first-preference votes, which equated to 35 per cent of the vote, Will topped the poll in Franklin in 2014, despite competing against both the Labor Premier Lara Giddings and Greens leader and now Senator Nick McKim. He became the fifth non-Labor Premier in 80 years and only the third Tasmanian Premier to govern in majority. Will Hodgman was re-elected to a second term in government following victory in the 2018 state election, succeeding Angus Bethune as Tasmania's longest-serving Liberal leader in the process. He received 27,184 first-preference votes, extending his support from 2014. After 18 years in the Tasmanian parliament Will resigned as Premier, the Tasmanian Liberals' Leader and an MP on 20 June 2020. During his time in parliament Will's portfolios included Attorney-General, justice, tourism, hospitality and events, trade, parks, heritage, Aboriginal affairs, arts, sport and recreation, prevention of family violence and advanced manufacturing and defence industries. In April 2020 Will was appointed as the inaugural chair to oversee the establishment and launch of the Australian Business Growth Fund before taking up his current diplomatic post late last year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael and Will Hodgman make up two of the four generations of Hodgman family politicians. This family commitment to political service to Tasmanians and Australians started with Thomas Christopher Hodgman, who was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly between 1900 and 1912. Thomas was born in Kent and came to Tasmania with his parents as a young boy. He became a farmer at Tea Tree and was a well-known stock agent with Kemp, Roberts and Co for more than 30 years. Thomas was elected to the Tasmanian parliament in 1900 as the member for Brighton in the House of Assembly, transferring to the electoral district of Monmouth in 1903. When proportional representation was introduced in 1909, Thomas was elected as an anti-socialist member for Franklin, retiring in 1912 when his electoral district was abolished. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thomas's brother Wilfred Hodgman was a lawyer with Page, Hodgman and Seager in Hobart. His son Bill, Michael's father and Will's grandfather, was the next Hodgman to enter the law and Tasmanian politics. William Clark 'Bill' Hodgman OBE, QC was born in Hobart in 1909 and attended The Hutchins School and University of Tasmania—a definite trend; he was the first of the three generations to do so. Bill worked in Melbourne before being admitted to the Supreme Court of Tasmania in 1938. Working with Hobart law firm Crisp and Rice, Bill became a leading criminal barrister and was made a Queen's Counsel in 1957. Bill was elected to the Tasmanian parliament in 1955 as a Liberal member for Denison in the House of Assembly but became an Independent in 1960. He lost his seat in 1964 but was re-elected in 1971 as a member of the Legislative Council for Queenborough. Bill was President of the Legislative Council from June 1981 until his retirement from parliament in May 1983. Bill was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1979 for service to the community. He died in Hobart in 1997 and was given a state funeral. And, like Michael and Will were to do later, Bill served in the Tasmanian parliament at different times with two of his sons, Michael and Peter, during their political careers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter Curtis Lee Hodgman was born in Hobart in 1946 and was elected to the Legislative Council in 1974 as an Independent member for Huon. In 1986 he resigned his seat and successfully contested the House of Assembly seat of Franklin as a Liberal Party member. Between 1986 and 1996 Peter held a number of ministerial portfolios in Robin Grey's Liberal government. These included construction, administrative services, environment, inland fisheries, women, sport and recreation, Antarctic affairs, and multicultural and ethnic affairs, where he was assisting the Premier. Peter resigned his state seat in October 2001. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, the Hodgman family—or perhaps I should say 'dynasty'—has made important contributions to both Tasmanian and Australian politics, with this influence continuing today through Will Hodgman's diplomatic efforts on behalf of Australia. We owe a debt of thanks to them for their service.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to talk about my travel through Central Queensland last week with Chris Bowen, Labor's shadow minister for climate change and energy. It was a great opportunity to get out and about with Chris following him taking over the portfolio of climate change and energy. It's an important issue to all Australians, but I think particularly for those throughout Central Queensland, which have a long history and tradition of working in that space. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We began the trip in Emerald, where we visited the reopened Gregory mine, which was shut down a couple of years ago by BMA but has been reopened recently by Sojitz. The day we visited, they had just been approved to restart their underground operations, which had been shut down. So they have an open-cut operation going, and soon they will have the underground mine reopened as well. It's a really positive story for the local community in Emerald. There are more jobs and investment in the region as a result. The great thing about the Sojitz Gregory mine is that the majority of the workforce, about 85 per cent, come from the local communities; they live in Emerald or Capella or surrounding areas. It really was great to meet with Cameron, Ben, Jake and others to hear about the jobs that have been created, the long-term planning for the mine and what the future holds for that community and those workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were able to get out and about and do a tour of the mine. I have been to a lot of mines and observed the rehabilitation efforts, which are basically continuous as those mines operate. It was particularly interesting to see the efforts they are undertaking in this area, including the potential, down the track, for solar to be used on part of the rehabilitated land. It shows you the world in which we are living and what is possible at coalmines in the future. It's a mine that has a large power need, and there is plenty of infrastructure in place to feed the potential solar power back into the grid. We had the opportunity to get up on the drag line and see the sheer volume of material that can be moved. Apparently this was only a medium-sized drag line, but it was moving something like a hundred tonnes effortlessly. I really appreciated the opportunity to go and visit. I thank the workers for taking the time out of their day to enable Chris Bowen and I to learn about their mine, what they do for work, as well as their future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the mine visit we drove back into Emerald and visited the Emerald Solar Park, where Kevin showed us around his site. It's been operating for a couple of years now. They've got 260,000 panels, producing around 72 megawatts of energy. All of that is sold directly to Telstra, who use the solar that is being produced in Emerald. This site is one of many renewable energy projects in the region, and there are also a number of proposed projects, which will continue to create jobs as well. Particularly at the moment there are a number of wind farms that are being pursued in this part of the world throughout regional Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the visit to Emerald Solar Park, we visited the Central Highlands Development Corporation, where we met with Councillor Daniel and Peter. They were able to brief us about their focus on job creation for the region, particularly given Chris Bowen was there. They had a focus on energy as well. That was a great opportunity. We had limited time, but it was great to hear firsthand from a council in the region that certainly has good, strong, bold plans for the future and understands the reality of what is happening in regional places like Emerald.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ending the day in Emerald, we met with some local mineworkers from mines like Ensham and Kestrel. It was great to catch up with these people over a beer and just have a bit of a chat about what is happening in their workplaces and what is happening in the region and get a general sense of the mood of these communities that have been such a significant part of powering Australia for years and will continue to be for many years to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next morning we got up early and drove 320 kilometres to Biloela. It took us about 3½ hours. We had a stop in Blackwater on the way and we visited the Callide B coal-fired power station. The Callide power station employs around 260 workers. The adjoining mine employs approximately 200 as well. It was first commissioned in 1988. Callide C, which is the adjoining power station, was commissioned in 2001. Together they produce around 1,525 megawatts of energy, which is about 20 per cent of Queensland's energy needs. I want to thank CS Energy and particularly Lee, Dan, Dave, Scott and Stacey for showing us around the power station. It was a valuable opportunity to get in, get around and talk to workers and see how it operates and also get a sense of the challenges that are confronting a coal-fired power station that is as old as that one is. We do understand the ageing nature of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the tour, we were able to have morning tea with the workers. They issued a general invitation to anyone who wanted to come along. About 30 or 40 of the workers took time to have a chat to Chris and me. I found it really invaluable being able to have quiet conversations with those workers and get a sense of their knowledge of what is going on in their industry but also their understanding of what their future looks like and the types of decisions that they have to make about their long-term future, whether it is in a place like Biloela and what the future job opportunities are there or if it's something that they need to look at. Talking to parents who are making decisions about where their children will go to high school and those sorts of things really gives you a sense that the decisions we make in this place have such an impact on those people as they go about planning their lives. We heard some frank views about those ongoing operations and what the future of energy generation will look like in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we caught up with the Central Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils, who just happened to be meeting in Biloela that day as well. They were from the Rocky, Central Highlands, Banana and Gladstone shires. We got to hear from them about their needs for communities and the importance of local jobs being created, with a particular focus on energy. But we didn't miss the opportunity to talk about Inland Rail with Gladstone as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key messages that I took from this trip—and this was consistent no matter which industry, council or worker—is that the government needs to have a plan. That is what is sadly lacking from this government. These people don't have their heads buried in the sand. They understand what the future holds, but they also want to ensure they can continue to live and enjoy life in these parts of the state. They want to ensure that businesses continue to invest and create jobs and create the future and certainty that comes with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the energy market is changing. Demand for power will actually continue to increase. As we see things like more electric cars being bought and driven there will be more demand for electricity as a result. We need to invest in the grid and in new projects to meet this demand. I have no doubt that this will create jobs and investment in regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast couldn't have been clearer last week when we saw the announcement of the closure of the Yallourn power station. Instead of the federal minister working constructively with state counterparts, all we saw from the federal minister was him taking pot shots at the state of Victoria in terms of how that closure is managed and transitioned. It is so frustrating when you go to these parts of Queensland that have significant workforce in this industry because you just know that it would be so important and so valuable if you actually had federal and state governments working together on these challenges. But instead all we see from the federal government in relation to this is an opportunity to take pot shots, an opportunity to create division and an opportunity to run scare campaigns rather than dealing with the reality of what Queenslanders and Australians are confronting in regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really thank Chris Bowen for his time in regional Queensland. Over a long period time and no matter which portfolio he has been in, he has always been someone who has been willing to get out, travel, listen and learn. It was a great first step for his first visit to regional Queensland. I'm confident that over the course of the next 12 months he'll be a regular visitor as Labor starts to talk more about what our plans are. We'll be upfront with these communities and we'll engage them in discussion. It will only be a Labor government that can offer those regional communities a better vision and opportunity for the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Okay, I've had it up to here with DVA—I've absolutely had it! I don't know how the veterans out there are able to take it, because I'm not far from breaking point myself. As for the guys working in my office, how they don't have Comcare claims in yet is beyond me. I'm at the point where I don't know what else to do. You can keep fighting and fighting, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs will still not admit that it has a massive problem. It is completely in chaos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are veterans out there who are dying before they can get help from the department that's supposed to be looking after them. There are veterans who are being cut out of and off help, and they have nowhere else to go. We're beyond crisis point, absolutely beyond crisis point. To be honest, I'm scared, I'm angry and I'm frustrated. But, underneath it all, I am terribly afraid. I don't like to show it, and it doesn't come naturally to me, but I am frightened. I'm frightened for my mate Brad Fewson. I have told you guys in here before about Brad. Brad served 10 years in the Australian Army, including in East Timor. He's a 41-year-old national hero. He has put his body on the line for our country and saved the lives and limbs of people and children who couldn't protect themselves. But his time in service has broken his body. The ADF broke his body. Repetitive shocks to his head have given him brain damage and Parkinson's. His brain no longer communicates effectively with his heart. His body will suddenly slump over; he gets feverish and he fatigues easily. Two or three times a day he has what he calls an 'episode' where he freezes and cannot speak or move. God love his wife, Laura, and their young boys, who have to resuscitate him frequently, because delays in his treatment have made his brain injuries worse. All of this has left him with Parkinson's disease, early-onset dementia, respiratory failure and autonomic dysfunction. His condition is terminal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that, his mental health is absolutely busted. He's the kind of guy who stops 40 metres behind a car at Macca's drive-through because he's worried it will blow up. And he's not the only veteran who does that; like so many other veterans, he carries the shadow of war around with him everywhere he goes. Laura keeps him going; she's his rock. She gives him the strength he needs to carry on. She does everything she can to keep him here. But his situation is getting so bad and there's only so much she can do. My heart breaks for both of them and their children. I can't tell you enough just how worried I am about what's about to happen to Mr Fewson. I don't want to have to attend this man's coronial inquest. I've seen too many veterans die, and I can't watch him go as well—I just can't; it's way too many. I'm begging—I'm at begging point—and if you need me to get down on my hands and knees, God, I will. Department of Veterans' Affairs: please help this man! Please help him! You know what needs to be done and I know what needs to be done. We all know what works; we just need the people in leadership to have the will and courage to get it done. It's all there on paper for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brad was one of the first veterans in Australia to get hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and it absolutely transformed him. It keeps him alive and gives him the oxygen he needs to stay alive. He went from being completely out of it back to being himself again. He can talk again, he can write again and he can speak words. He can say to his wife, 'I love you.' Speaking those words, 'I love you,' that's what the therapy gave him the strength to do. But the Department of Veterans' Affairs are not going to pay for him to get that therapy anymore. They won't pay for him to get to Melbourne so that he can have the therapy he needs to take his next breath of oxygen. They won't pay for his accommodation while he gets the therapy he needs. They've basically cut Brad off, waiting for him to die, and all because some paper pusher in Canberra says he doesn't have a referral for the therapy he needs to keep him alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've had this for 16 months, Department of Veterans' Affairs. It's sitting in his medical file. Get yourselves an appointment at Specsavers and get it sorted! Wake up, because without this treatment you know and I know he is going to die and we're all going to a coronial inquest, and, by God, I will not hold back on your department. I'll bring the minister in. I'll bring the secretary in. I'll bring the MO in. You're all coming in. I've got all the evidence. What you have done to this man and his family is beyond disgusting! It is incompetent. It's absolutely incompetent, and you're killing him. You're killing him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the typical delay, deny, die, isn't it? Nothing goes away. The brand of the department is delay, deny, die. This is what you are doing to our veterans. This is what you are doing. And it's not just the veterans who suffer, it's their families too—and by God are they suffering! Brad's wife Laura is all of about 28 kilograms. That is where she is at. The stress is killing her. She is his full-time carer because you can't even get his carers right. You can't even get 24-hour carers right for him, you are so incompetent! She's on her own and she's exhausted. How many times do I need to tell you people that? How many times do I need to tell the minister? How many times do I need to tell the hierarchy of the Department of Veterans' Affairs? When is one of you going to do something? When he dies? When it's absolutely too late? I can tell you now that she can't hold on for much longer, and you cannot expect her to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both of these people—Brad and Laura—are extremely strong, but their strength will only go so far before there is nothing left. The full weight of a lying and uncaring department that covers things up, because that is all you do, cover up your incompetence, is a heavy burden to bear, and it's too much for a sick man to carry on his shoulders—a dying man at that. Getting the department to sit up and take notice is taking everything I've got. I'm exhausted, they're exhausted and there are other veterans out there who are exhausted from dealing with the incompetent bureaucracy in your department. You are finished. You are gone. You might as well just shut the door. It's over! How many more veterans are you going to kill? How many more?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These people are human beings. They are not numbers. They are not numbers; they are human beings. Where are you, Minister Chester? Where are you, Minister? Six weeks ago I sat down with you for 45 minutes and went through Brad Fewson's issues and what was going on. And what have you done? What have you done, Darren? Absolutely nothing! You've got a dying man there, big boy, fix it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to Liz Cosson. She's absolutely a waste of space. In desperation, I even called the cut-rate commissioner this morning, because I'm at my wit's end. I'm done! I have been working on this for 15 or 16 months and nothing has changed. Their kids are going through hell, and God knows how Brad keeps breathing every morning. This is the state our veterans are in. I hear it every day. In my office, Karen works on veteran cases every single day. There have been 1,200 of them come through our books since I have been back in parliament. They have come for help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and the department can pat themselves on the back all they like, but I and my team know what's going on on the ground, and so does everyone else out there. You are not fit for purpose. You are finished. For goodness sake, stop mucking around with their lives and call a royal commission. It is enough. God help you if you do not help Brad and his family in the next 24 hours, because I swear to God it will be the biggest coronial inquest you'll ever see. I'll be there on the stand. I'll be there with all your cover-ups, your materials and your lies on what you have done to this man and his family. God help you!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I recently had the great pleasure of attending the 200th anniversary mass to celebrate Catholic education in Australia. It took place just down the road from here at St Christopher's Cathedral in Manuka. It was fantastic to join with my local Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn and celebrate the very substantial contribution made by Catholic schools to Australian education. It's often overlooked, but many of us in this place enjoyed the education provided to us by a local Catholic school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra established its first Catholic school 107 years after the first Catholic school in Australia was established, although, if we go to the broader diocese, there were a number of Catholic schools in the region from the mid 19th century. In terms of Canberra, it was 1927 when St Christopher's school and convent were established by the local archdiocese. This school would later fold and is now the site of the Catholic Education Office adjacent to the cathedral.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Understanding the history of the Catholic school system is crucial to understanding the broader development of Australia and, indeed, the ACT. Of course, it is no lie that, without this private investment, our education system would look very different. I'm reminded that in our region the Goulburn strike famously led to a change in education policy at a national level—a change which I think has been very positive. The 1,746 Catholic schools in Australia underpin the high-quality learning and education of more than 764,100 students and support 77,035 staff and their families. There can be no doubt that this contribution has taken pressure off the public education system as we meet our growing population's education needs. A major theme of Catholic education is to not only contribute to parish life but also serve all facets of secular Australian life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the anniversary mass I was reminded of my own education at St Thomas the Apostle in Kambah followed by Padua Catholic High School and St Peter's. They've now merged to become St Mary MacKillop Catholic College, which is a great local school with a campus in Wanniassa and a campus in Isabella Plains. I always valued that education. I was encouraged to explore academic and other goals. The education was also infused in the Catholic faith. This point was made very eloquently by Archbishop Christopher Prowse during his homily on the day: an education system founded on Catholic values and principles will help instil an enduring and positive legacy for future generations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Catholic and broader non-government school sector offers choice for parents in their children's education, alongside a very strong and well-resourced public education system. Choice is incredibly important in any sector, but none is more important than the choice parents have in terms of their children's education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank the Catholic Education Office on hosting a wonderful mass. I congratulate them and, more broadly, the system for their 200 years of contribution to Australian life and education. I particularly thank all of the teachers, all of the staff and all those who have contributed over that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to also speak about some of the great infrastructure initiatives that the federal Liberal-National government has committed to right here in Canberra and in our region. This increased infrastructure funding through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is a direct product of and part of our government's infrastructure bonanza for Canberra. It has been an absolute bonanza. As part of this program, I was pleased to join with Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack to announce the Commonwealth's plan to fund restoration work on the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge. For those who have had the pleasure of visiting our great city, the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge is always a major feature along the drive between north and south. The upgrade, which will be delivered by the National Capital Authority, will strengthen the bridge to prevent structural damage, widen the pedestrian pathways and replace the vehicle safety barriers to improve road safety. This comes on the back of that. We had an announcement for a contribution of $132 million for stage 2A of the light rail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the bonanza goes on. The federal government has also committed to funding new security landscaping, scoreboard repairs and thermal and smoke detectors throughout Manuka Oval and GIO Stadium; $4 million in extra funding for surge road maintenance, including hot asphalt patching and resealing to repair recent rain damage and prevent future damage; and $1 million to purchase 3,000 plants to enhance Canberra's living infrastructure in areas of low canopy cover and to replace ageing trees. It goes on: $1.26 million to install new shade sails and fencing at priority playgrounds to make these spaces cooler and safer; a new competition-standard half-pipe at Belconnen Skate Park on Emu Bank Road; and, of course, the overall investments in infrastructure I mentioned. That is underpinned by the $500 million that we are investing in the expansion of the Australian War Memorial, something that will be a legacy for future generations as we more fully honour our veterans. It will of course be very important here in Canberra as we see not just those construction jobs but also the uplift for tourism as our most loved and most visited attraction gets a major expansion. We will see more visitors coming to the city from our region, from around Australia and, indeed, from around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is part of a bonanza for Canberra; $1.4 billion has been committed to infrastructure projects across the territory in recent years. They include the Monaro Highway, the Tuggeranong Parkway, the Molonglo Valley bridge, the duplication of Gundaroo Drive, the Kings Highway and the Barton Highway. We are seeing huge investments around the ACT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would love to talk a little bit about the Ricky Stuart Foundation. For my fellow NRL lovers, Ricky Stuart has of course been a huge name in the game for many years as a great player and now, indeed, as a great coach for our local Canberra Raiders. I would also like to point out some of his work off the field. The Ricky Stuart Foundation was established in 2011 to support Ricky in raising awareness for autism as well as to raise funds to directly support the aftercare of autism spectrum disorders and help family members who may struggle to cope. Aftercare is critical to ensuring that families and those with autism can carry on with their lives in the most positive way possible once a diagnosis has been given. Together with the help of the government's National Disability Insurance Scheme, foundations like the Ricky Stuart Foundation provide short-term respite right here in Canberra for families struggling with disabilities. Over the past 10 years, the foundation has built and run $3.5 million in respite facilities for Canberra families to use. With Ricky Stuart House in Chifley and Emma Ruby House in Cook already in operation, it was exciting to hear that a third, the John Fordham House, will begin construction shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this facility will be built just over the border in Queanbeyan, it will add to the tremendous work the foundation has done so far. John Fordham House will aim to be a facility where disabled young adults can learn to achieve full independence. The facility will be individual living and have a village atmosphere for people with disabilities to be able to live on their own while having support available when it's required. I want to reiterate my thanks to Ricky and the Ricky Stuart Foundation and commend them for their outstanding work.</span>

It's hopeless, it's hapless, it's friendless and it will not do the job of guaranteeing that people on the ground who have been hardest hit by the closure of international borders will have their jobs. Every single job that is lost because JobKeeper is cut is on this government. They are responsible, they need to step in and there is no substitute for JobKeeper. The flight announcement that this government made is not enough.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take the interjection. I think it actually is going quite well. We've had some interruption to our supply from international sources, and everybody would understand that. To date, over 200,000 Australians have received their vaccination across the country, and that number continues to ramp up as we extend the rollout of vaccination. Today we've announced the GP services that will start vaccinating Australians—over a thousand sites around the country—in phase 1b, as of next week. We continue to build and grow the vaccination process for Australia as vaccines become available and as the capacity of the system is built. We have today vaccinated over 200,000 Australians and we continue to grow that and we continue to build the capacity of the system in Australia to do that—through, as of next week, GPs and Commonwealth vaccination clinics. And of course the states are currently rolling out their vaccines—at varying rates, I must admit. But the states are rolling out their vaccines to their frontline health workers as a part of phase 1a. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I accept that the number that Senator Dodson was talking about was four million, not 4,000. I reject the premise of the question that Senator Dodson put, in the context of where the government's situation sits. He is right, though, in the context of the confidence that it will give to Australians as the vaccine rolls out. But, as we all know, we have had some constraint in supply from overseas. The opposition might like to try and downplay that, but that is a reality. We've always accepted that that was an issue that we might confront, but we are in the very fortunate position that we have sovereign supply in this country, and we will continue to roll that out in the interests of Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As the Prime Minister and I announced this morning, Australia is standing with Papua New Guinea as they respond to a serious and widespread outbreak in COVID cases. The Prime Minister, the Minister for International Development and the Pacific and I, and our High Commissioner in Port Moresby, have been in regular contact with our Papua New Guinea colleagues and the Papua New Guinea government on how we can partner to assist in the response effort. There have been 2,479 cases officially reported, which is a surge of over 1,180 since 27 February. While the outbreak is concentrated in Port Moresby, there are cases in provinces across Papua New Guinea and, sadly, there have been 31 recorded deaths.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has responded to our nearest neighbour in our Pacific family through the pivot of our aid program under our Partnerships for Recovery and our COVID-19 response plans. The work that we've announced today is in strong partnership with Papua New Guinea, based on their priorities and their needs. I noted earlier that our High Commissioner has been working closely with the Papua New Guinea government to ensure our support is well targeted to Papua New Guinea's needs. Indeed, his team are also part of Papua New Guinea's national COVID-19 technical working group. Over the last week, Australia has assisted to increase the number of beds available for COVID patients and funded St John Ambulance PNG, to increase its capacity. That's for patient transport, for COVID testing and for PPE distribution to clinics. Australia has also added ballast to Papua New Guinea's National Control Centre for COVID-19. From our own experience we know that communications, risk and quarantine management are absolutely critical. We'll work closely with our partners in Papua New Guinea, particularly the health authorities and the National Control Centre for COVID-19, in addressing this crisis.</span>

That focus will be for frontline workers, who are very exposed at the moment. We're providing $144 million to support Papua New Guinea's priorities and planning in their own vaccine program. With the agreement of Papua New Guinea, Australia is also asking AstraZeneca and European authorities to access one million doses of our contracted supplies for Papua New Guinea. Today, Defence will transport 2,000 tents for safe triaging, referral and transfer of patients outside Port Moresby General Hospital. We'll provide surgical masks, P2/N95 respirator masks, protective gowns and goggles, gloves, sanitiser and face shields. Our AUSMAT team, which arrives on Monday, will work with Papua New Guinea authorities on infection control, triage and public health measures.</span>

What our government is confident of—indeed, the advice that has been received from and made public in various statements by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury is to expect to continue to see jobs growth and jobs recovery as a result of the continued stimulus and activity going in across the Australian economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper has absolutely saved many jobs. JobKeeper has, in fact, saved more than 700,000 jobs, on the estimates of experts. Other measures we've put in place include the tax cuts that I was talking about in this chamber yesterday, putting an extra $1 billion a month into the pockets of Australian households. They continue to drive extra economic activity and extra support. The $1.2 billion package announced in recent weeks in relation to support for the aviation, travel and tourism sectors will, again, provide additional activity job support across the Australian economy. The investment incentive measures we put in place and the loss carry-back measures that are there provide additional support for businesses across the Australian economy and continue to underpin jobs.</span>

My question asked one thing: how many of the more than 350,000 workers will lose their jobs? They want to know this information.</span>

And the government is delivering on its policies, as we had always outlined and promised. We always said that our policies in response to this would be targeted and proportionate. We always said that JobKeeper would taper off—as indeed the opposition had called for. We also always said that it would come to an end at the appropriate time—also as the opposition called for.

All Aboriginal deaths in custody are a tragedy, and every single death that occurs in custody is a tragedy. It is an ongoing problem and challenge for the nation that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are overrepresented in our adult and youth justice systems, both as offenders and as victims. Indeed, while the rates of death in custody for Indigenous prisoners is lower than for non-Indigenous prisoners, any death in custody is one too many. As the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found, the fundamental issue is that too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new National Agreement on Closing the Gap includes targets for reducing the rate of adult incarceration by at least 15 per cent, which is target 10, and of youth detention by at least 30 per cent, which is target 11, amongst Indigenous Australians by 2031. The Indigenous Advancement Strategy of the government funds activities to complement the efforts of states and territories to improve justice and community safety outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Some $261.3 million has been committed in 2020-21 alone. We recognise the seriousness of these issues and, through the closing the gap agreement, we are committed to working with states and territories, but also, most importantly, with individual communities, to seek to overcome and to address these issues. But we know there is no quick or silver bullet to doing so. It is why, though, we have spelt out clear targets, clear funding, and work to try to address this tragedy that ensues. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're now into week 4 of the mass vaccine rollout across Australia and we are prioritising the most vulnerable in society, as we should, to receive the vaccine first. Each week, more aged-care residents, border and quarantine and frontline health workers have had the opportunity to receive their first dose of the vaccine. This week we also saw the start of the second-dose round being administered, so we are now in the position to start to have citizens fully immunised against the COVID-19 virus. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the AstraZeneca vaccine require two doses for people to be fully immunised, the Pfizer vaccine 21 days apart and the AstraZeneca 12 weeks apart. Senator Van, I'm sure you'll be glad to hear that vaccinations are gathering pace in your home state of Victoria. So far more than 38,900 people in Victoria have had a jab against COVID. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next week we'll begin phase 1b of our vaccination program, which includes vulnerable groups, including older people and people with underlying medical conditions. We are enlisting general practices across the country to play a major role in the vaccination rollout and have been heartened by the enthusiasm of GPs to get on board our vaccination program, with 1,100 commencing next week. We thank all Australians, including our frontline workers and GPs, for their commitment and hard work in rolling out the vaccinations in this country. We are getting on with delivering the vaccine and it will underpin our health and economic recovery. </span>

Indeed, we've been progressively ramping up our rollout in aged-care homes, and today residents of 26 facilities across the country will receive vaccinations. Healthcare teams will also be visiting 35 aged-care facilities for the second time to deliver second doses to our most vulnerable citizens. In coming weeks the vaccination program will reach more than 2½ thousand residential aged-care facilities, and more than 183,000 residents will be vaccinated, including 339,000 staff. </span>

GP services will progressively come online from 22 March, which is what we said would happen when we announced the vaccination rollout program. By the end of April we'll have more than 4,000 GP services assisting us with the vaccination program. This staged scale-up will align with the supply of AstraZeneca vaccine, and as more vaccine becomes available more services will come online. There are six million people in the second phase of the vaccine rollout, and I want to assure Australians that everyone who wants a vaccine will get one. But I would also urge them to be patient. As the vaccine becomes available, we will make it available to Australians. </span>

The government expects defence industry doing business with Australia to meet their commitments to manage their costs and to deliver projects on time and according to our specifications. That will not be done at the expense of Australian jobs and Australian industry. In the case of the attack-class submarine, we expect that Naval Group's commitment to spend a minimum 60 per cent of their contract value in Australia will be finalised as a matter of priority.</span>

We have been very clear that we will not agree to provisions in the strategic partnering agreement that are not meaningful and measurable over the long duration of the program or that dilute the protections we currently have. The government is a strong client and will maintain a fit-for-purpose agreement for decades to come. I'm advised that Defence and Naval Group have made progress on the agreement, with details being worked through to finalise the amendments to the strategic partnering agreement.</span>

I want to be clear about the amendments to the strategic partnering agreement, though, because they are detailed provisions that apply to Naval Group's achievement of the commitment, including both remedies and incentives. As with all provisions in the strategic partnering agreement and, indeed, other major defence contracts, as Senator Gallacher is well aware from his extended period of time on committees that deal with these matters in the parliament, the specifics of these amendments will remain commercially sensitive. Similar to our other projects, AIC performance will remain subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the Senate estimates process and the program will remain the subject, as it has been, of ongoing, regular reviews by the ANAO.</span>

In the Morrison government, those of us on this side of the chamber, the one thing we well and truly all agree on is that tax cuts well and truly benefit the economy. We believe that lower taxes are the best way for our economy to thrive. What do they do? They put more money in the pockets of hardworking Australians—and of course that money is the money of those hardworking Australians, so we're really giving it back to them. But we're also putting money back into the pockets of small businesses. As we know, when a small business get a tax cut, they actually invest back into their business, and that's a good thing for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since last July about $9 billion in tax cuts has landed in the pockets of around 8.8 million Australians. This is money that has been returned to them. What has it done? It has boosted household balance sheets. What we've also seen is consumer confidence rise now above pre-pandemic levels. We're not stopping there, though. A further $2 billion per month in tax cuts will flow to Australians between now and the end of September. Why is that? Because the Morrison government believe in giving people back their hard-earned money by way of reducing their taxes. What that also means for small businesses is that, when households are able to keep more of their money—$9 billion is now back in the pockets of families—they are able to go out and support those local businesses. Of course, when you support a local business, you're ultimately supporting jobs, and that's what this government is all about—supporting jobs in the economy.</span>

                  </a>  We'll get to that shortly. Last year we reduced the small-business company tax rate to 26 per cent. These changes are a part of what the Morrison government is doing to accelerate small-business tax cuts. We also brought forward that tax relief for SMEs by five years. In fact, under the Morrison government, small businesses are paying the lowest company tax rate since 1967. But we're not stopping there. We will now reduce that. The small-business company tax rate will fall to 25 per cent on 1 July, because we know, when you back small business, you back jobs.</span>

It's bad enough that they took to the last election a commitment to slug Australians with $387 billion worth of taxes. Colleagues, can you imagine the state of the economy if that had occurred and then COVID-19 had hit? But they didn't stop there. The former Leader of the Opposition has yet again confirmed to the Australian people that, when it comes to lowering taxes, the Labor Party just don't believe there is any point. This is what he said: 'What is the point of giving a tax cut?' Well, I'd ask all those hardworking Australians out there who are benefiting from—</span>

The Attorney-General will return to his office informed by the advice of the Solicitor-General around the conduct of those duties. I can't take the first question on notice, to pre-empt the advice and information of the Solicitor-General. But certainly we will make sure that it is transparent to all, once that advice is received and the Attorney returns to work, exactly the procedures that are in place. Where there are duties that need to be fulfilled by Senator Stoker, we have full confidence that the Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General will fulfil those duties fully and with absolute competence and confidence. </span>

This was an appointment of an assistant minister to the Attorney-General that had not previously existed and, quite appropriately, responsibilities were passed from the Attorney-General to Senator Stoker at the time. Indeed, she is pursuing further responses to the Respect@work inquiry—further responses to it, I add—because, indeed, the government has gotten on with a number of aspects of responding to the Respect@work inquiry. There is the $2.1 million provided to support and implement a number of recommendations and work to establish the Respect@Work Council, which has been established and is due to meet for the first time this Friday. The establishment of the Respect at Work website is a central platform for resources on sexual harassment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Morrison government are delivering on our plan to provide Australian families and businesses with the affordable and reliable power they need to help cement our economic recovery and to create jobs. As I updated senators in February, we have delivered eight consecutive quarters of year-on-year CPI retail price reductions, and prices are set to continue to fall, putting more money in the hands of Australians and more money into Australian households and Australian business.

When we compare our effort, our 19 per cent reduction since 2005, with New Zealand on one per cent and with a 0.1 per cent reduction in Canada, this is something we should all be celebrating. We have overachieved on our target by 639 million tonnes. Our emissions fell faster than in Canada, New Zealand, Japan and the United States, and were more than double the OECD average. So we can do this; we can deliver emissions reductions while delivering lower energy prices for Australian families, households and businesses. That's something we can all celebrate and that's something we can all get behind.</span>

Leading the Labor Party's policy is the member for McMahon, who has never seen a tax that he didn't support. He's backed, of course, by the Queensland resources spokesman, Senator Murray Watt. Labor's car tax alone, of course, would have added $3,000 to the cost of a new vehicle.</span>

After months of uncertainty for the half a million workers across our tourism sector, the government made a chaotic announcement of meagre support beyond the withdrawal of JobKeeper. In this chaotic announcement, the government flagged a total cap of 800,000 discounted tickets. Now that the government has been forced to expand the scheme due to political pressure, which of the 13 original locations will have their share of this support slashed?</span>

I reject the premise of Senator Farrell's question, because Senator Farrell has failed to acknowledge this important next step in the government's national economic recovery plan, which is about supporting businesses, workers and regions who are still finding it very difficult in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period. The package's mix—whether it is discounted airline tickets, loans for business or direct support to keep planes in the air and airline workers in their jobs—is an important part of building that bridge back to a normal way of life for Australians. The centrepiece of this package is a demand driven program—as the senator said, 800,000 half-price airfares—to actually enable Australians to travel, to actually support tourism operators, businesses, travel agents and airlines who have been dealing with these challenges.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't understand why those opposite do not support that initiative, to actually engage with those businesses, to actually enable those Australians to travel. The package ultimately will take more tourists, whether it is to our hotels and our cafes or to go on tours, to explore our own backyard. That does mean more jobs and investment for the tourism and aviation sectors. It is a win for local communities, and local communities that were spelt out here earlier in the week, in the chamber, don't understand why those opposite don't support those local communities and don't want to support them with this package. The half-price ticket program, initially operating to 13 key regions, and other new measures in the support package, include that new international aviation support to assist Australia's international passenger airlines to maintain over 8,000 core international aviation jobs; support for regular passenger airports to meet their domestic security costs; a new aviation services assistance support program to help ground-handling companies to meet the costs of mandatory training certification and accreditation— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As the tourism minister said in comments the day before yesterday, I think, we are going to continue to work with the aviation sector. For example, if there are other destinations we need to add, we will do that. It is about giving people the confidence to travel, because, if people have the confidence to travel, we know that the demand and the will are there and we know that they will take that up.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:01</span>):  For the information of the Senate, I table information from the Chair of the Select Committee on COVID-19, Senator Gallagher, regarding seven recommendations made by the committee in its second interim report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addressing those recommendations and the correspondence that I have just tabled, at the outset I would like to restate some of the remarks made by Senators Paterson and Davey in their additional comments to the second interim report. It is important to note that the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19 was appropriately established with bipartisan support on 8 April 2020, notably under the broadest possible terms of reference and with a tenure that effectively ensures it does not expire until the end of this term of parliament. That is the wish of the committee. It is beyond doubt that both government and opposition parties acknowledge and respect the important role parliamentary oversight plays in our Westminster system of government, as reflected by the establishment of this committee during the most extraordinary of times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the committee has held over 40 public hearings, published over 500 submissions by interested organisations and individuals and published over 700 associated documents. It is noteworthy that, in a time of health and economic crisis, officials from the Department of Health have appropriately appeared before the committee in public hearings no fewer than 10 times, and officials from the Department of the Treasury have appeared before the committee in public hearings no fewer than eight times, to answer questions on how they and the government have responded to the dual health and economic crises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has received nearly 2,000 answers to questions on notice throughout this period, overwhelmingly from government departments—a remarkable demonstration of cooperation and transparency, especially when considering they did so while managing the day-to-day fight against a once-in-a-generation global pandemic and associated economic crisis. They did so in addition to the work of those departments responding also to other estimates questions on notice and other parliamentary questions on notice, which appear to have been no less frequent during that time. The relatively few disagreements between the committee and the government about a small number of public interest immunity claims should be viewed in light of the overall significant cooperation and information sharing undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the specific claims of public interest immunity, as noted in my correspondence to the chair of the committee, Senator Gallagher, the government maintains the public interest immunity claims advanced in the initial responses to the committee's requests. The government holds the strong view that the documents and information sought would or could reasonably be expected to disclose the deliberations of the cabinet or a committee of the cabinet. Along with national security, this is the most longstanding and fundamental ground of a public interest immunity claim. As is well recognised in the Westminster system, it is in the public interest to preserve the confidentiality of cabinet deliberations to ensure the best possible decisions are made following thorough consideration and informed discussion of relevant proposals within cabinet. It is not in the public interest to disclose information about the cabinet's deliberations, as it may impact in the future upon government's ability to receive confidential information and to make appropriately informed decisions impacting upon the Australian community. In keeping with this longstanding practice, information about the operation and business of the cabinet and its committees—including when a matter went to the cabinet, who attended and what form of submission was provided—could potentially reveal the deliberations of the cabinet, which remain confidential for the reasons I've outlined.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the request for legal advice, while I note that the Senate has not accepted legal professional privilege as a public interest immunity, it has been the longstanding practice of successive Australian governments not to disclose privileged legal advice. This practice has previously been outlined by the Hon. Gareth Evans QC, in 1995:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nor is it the practice or has it been the practice over the years for any government to make available legal advice from its legal advisers made in the course of the normal decision making process of government, for good practical reasons associated with good government and also as a matter of fundamental principle.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To the extent that we are now going to go to the content of the advice, can I say that it has been a longstanding practice of both this government and successive governments not to disclose the content of advice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government maintains, consistent with the positions put by ministers of previous governments of both Labor and coalition persuasion, that it is not in the public interest to depart from this established position.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is integral that privileged legal advice provided to the Commonwealth remains confidential. Access by government to such confidential advice is, in practical terms, essential to the development of sound Commonwealth policy and robust lawmaking. The specific harm that the doctrine of legal professional privilege seeks to prevent is the harm to the administration of justice that would result from the disclosure of confidential interactions between lawyer and client. Both the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have confirmed that legal professional privilege promotes the public interest by enhancing the administration of justice, facilitating freedom of consultation and encouraging full and frank disclosure between clients and their advisers. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to respond to and comment on the matters in the tabled letter to Senator Gallagher.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has just witnessed four ministers come into the chamber and give the proverbial finger to non-executive members of this place. That's what just happened. Make no mistake. There were a lot of words expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but they were a lot of words to try to justify the unjustifiable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: the Senate committee have worked well and have worked hard—Senator Birmingham made those points—but have been thorough as well. Public servants refused to provide information and hoped that we would just forget about it, but we didn't. We wrote to those heads of department and said, 'You took this on notice and you haven't replied.' They then referred it to ministers and eventually, often months later, we got a response from ministers with the lazy use of the public interest immunity claim. Often they did not even specify the nature of the harm that would be caused to the public by providing that information to the committee. Most of them didn't even abide by the Cormann motion of 2009 that clearly sets out the way for public servants and ministers to work through that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then considered the claims. On two of them we agreed with the government. On the others we didn't. We brought that to this chamber and we won the vote. Every non-government senator in this place considered the matter, as we are required to do. As Harry Evans specified in his note in 2005, when that matter arises in a committee it should be brought back and reported to the Senate. That is what we did. The Senate voted to order the government to provide that information or, in the absence of doing that, to make a statement outlining exactly why they aren't going to provide that information, and I'll come to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want people to understand this because there's a broader principle here. Yes, we are after the information. We are after information that I didn't even think would ever be refused by the government, such as the date the cabinet first got briefed about the pandemic. That's pretty relevant to the work that the COVID committee was set up to do, which is to monitor the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. When did you first get briefed? When did the Chief Medical Officer first provide information to the cabinet? The minister for aged care had a COVID crisis. COVID was raging through the aged-care facilities that he was responsible for and hundreds of people were dying. When did he first brief the cabinet? Was it in May, June or July? We didn't ask what he briefed the cabinet with, but when he briefed it. We didn't ask about cabinet deliberations. We never sought information that related to ongoing discussions within cabinet. We accept that. But dates? Come on!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How are we meant to fulfil our job? We find the government in this position after, in a very stubborn way, they took the decision not to provide it. We won an order for the production of documents, some six months after the questions were asked, and you're still saying they relate to cabinet deliberations. It's ridiculous. The information sought is not unreasonable. It should've been provided at the time. For example, we asked for the date on which the AHPPC—a body that the government often tosses around as being the most important body that's been assisting them with the pandemic—first briefed the Minister for Health and Ageing. When did they first go to cabinet? When did they brief the national cabinet? The Productivity Commission chair gave a presentation to national cabinet, so it's gone to all of those governments. 'Could we have a copy of the presentation, please?' 'No. Top secret. Not allowed to have it.' Other governments are allowed to have it, and what they do with it is up to them. They've all got the presentation, but we're not allowed the PowerPoint. It's ridiculous. We asked for some of the information about the economic support packages, the information that went into determining that that was the package. We didn't ask, 'What were the options before you made the decisions about the package?' but we asked, 'What were the expectations for what that package would deliver?' 'No, not allowed any of that information.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our terms of reference are very simple: to monitor the Australian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these questions relate to the health and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, we have got a lot of information out of the Public Service. Sometimes it's been painful, but we have got it. Sometimes it's clear they don't want to answer, probably because they're worried about whether they'll get in trouble or not. But we persist and we tell them, 'You're not allowed to say nothing or refuse to answer.' We explain that to them. But that is part of their job. Senator Birmingham says, 'Well, they've come to all these hearings and they've provided all this information.' Yes, because they're accountable to this chamber as well as working for executive government. It's not an option; it's part of their job to support the work of Senate committees. They may not see it that way and, under this government, I think their interaction with Senate committees has changed a little. But it is part of their job. They do not have an option about whether or not they want to participate. So, yes, I appreciate the fact that they have come before the committee. But I don't think it's out of charity or that we should feel honoured that they've come, and I've explained to them before that it is part of their job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I read the advice of the great Harry Evans, he is clear in his note about the grounds for claiming public interest immunity and what the Senate has accepted as being legitimate or potentially acceptable grounds, which are listed. He also goes to those grounds that haven't been accepted by the Senate as reasons to withhold information, and they include advice to government. Quite often we ask witnesses about whether they've provided advice. They might not want to answer even that question. They say: 'It's advice to government. You can't have it.' No, the Senate has never accepted that. Legal professional privilege: the Senate has never accepted that. Cabinet-in-confidence: the Senate has never accepted that. They are all reasons that this government is using to withhold this information. The Senate has never accepted that. We have accepted that, if it would disclose information that relates to the deliberations of cabinet, that is a reason to withhold information, and we are not trying to change that. But just because you've stamped 'cabinet-in-confidence' on it or it might have been walked through on a trolley along with the sandwiches and cups of tea—in a COVID-safe way, of course—that does not mean that that information should be withheld from the Senate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham has a very polite style, but what he has done today is to say to every non-executive member of this place, 'Whatever you ask for and on whatever terms you ask for it, we are the ones who decide and we have decided that the Senate is not having it.' So, whilst they're trying to get through the IR bill and do deals with crossbench members, think about this. They're trying to be nice to you on the one hand, but you said the other day that you wanted this information and they have come in here and said, 'Bad luck.' That's what they've said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this government is known for: secrecy, doublespeak and withholding information when it's politically inconvenient to release it. That is what this is about. So maybe we won't get this information, even though the committee wants it and the Senate has actually asked the government to provide it. But the principle here is that we don't accept the lazy approach and the misuse of the public interest immunity claims process. We don't accept it; the Senate should not accept it. We do think this information should be provided and that this is a principle that the Senate should stay firm on, because if we let this one through, what next, Senators? I think anything becomes possible then. If we don't stand up and push back on this today and have some consequence for this, what next?</span>

I'd also remind the chamber that it's not the first time that this has happened in very recent history. We don't have to go far back to work out when it occurred—robodebt. It was repeatedly used there, and they refused to provide the Committee on Community Affairs with the information that we were very justified in asking for, about their decision-making around robodebt. I'm using that as an example not to prosecute that argument yet again but to show that this government keeps hiding behind cabinet-in-confidence arguments again and again. As Senator Gallagher has just said, wheeling a trolley through the cabinet with some documents piled high on anything that the Senate might ask for is not appropriate. This isn't the first time the government has been hiding behind cabinet-in-confidence or public interest immunity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd argue very strongly that there's not a cabinet-in-confidence argument against telling us. One of the questions that they refuse to answer is how they determined the Coronavirus Supplement rate. How did they determine it? Wouldn't you think it was in the public interest to know that? I tell you what, I'm really interested to know, because it's very important for the debate on the legislation that we'll have later in this chamber, probably tomorrow—rushed through, and we'll no doubt get a motion on hours, where they'll then of course include the guillotine and try to gag debate on the government's appalling rate of increase to JobSeeker, which the legislation that will come before this chamber sets at just $25 a week. When the Coronavirus Supplement was doubled, this Senate supported and agreed with it. The government knew that people couldn't survive on $40 a day. We wanted to know, quite justifiably, because it was a COVID response, how that rate was determined. No, they won't tell us. We also asked for the modelling on the JobSeeker payment. No, they won't tell us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We asked for the modelling around the stage 2 tax cuts. No, they won't tell us. We asked when cabinet was first briefed by the Chief Medical Officer—an absolutely fundamental question. No: 'It's secret; we won't tell you.' You have to ask: what have they got to hide? It's a really simple question that Australia has the right to know the answer to. Why not tell us?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also asked: when did the minister for aged care, Minister Colbeck, brief cabinet on the aged-care issues that we plainly saw roll out in this country? Nuh, he wouldn't tell us. We also asked how often the minister for aged care had briefed cabinet on the aged-care crisis—and not one person here could deny that we had a crisis—but did he tell us? No. Apparently that's secret too. How many times? When did he recognise that we had a crisis on our hands? When did the government know that Australia had a crisis in aged care on its hands? We don't know, because he won't tell us. He wouldn't tell us. The government won't tell us. Oh, that's right—it's cabinet-in-confidence! How often did he brief? When did he brief? When did he attend cabinet? When did the government know? It tells us how urgently, and when, they started responding to the crisis. No, they won't tell us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also asked about child care. We all know that in the heat of the crisis last year there were amendments made to payments and to how we approached child care. They won't provide the modelling for why they then changed their mind and ended that particular approach. They won't provide that and they won't provide the parameters on JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They won't provide the information on when cabinet decided that Australia was going for a suppression approach to COVID rather than an elimination approach to COVID. These are all questions that are very legitimate questions for the COVID committee. They are part of our work. The committee was charged by this place to do this work, but the government won't provide that information. They are key bits of information for the committee to do its work, and not just for us to do our work but for broader Australia to know. But, no, it's cabinet-in-confidence. As has been discussed in this chamber before, we don't accept those claims. This is information the committee should have access to and Australia should have access to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go back to the issues around the coronavirus supplement. Those were very important decisions that the government made. They were happy to take the Australian community's support for it and its welcoming of it, but they're not happy to tell us how they came to the rate. That is appalling. Australia has a right to know how we decided on that rate. Having access to that rate has made a lot of difference to Australians who are unemployed, so I argue very strongly that we have a right to know how that rate was arrived at. It was so important and it is so important. But of course the government don't want to release that information, because they know it will make an absolute mockery of the lousy 25 bucks a week, $3.57 a day—I challenge people to find somewhere in this country where they can buy a cup of coffee for $3.57—that they are going to ask this place to pass within 24 hours or—it may be a bit longer depending on whether we get an hours motion—36 hours.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  I rise to take note of the minister's response. I accept what the Minister for Finance has said in relation to the Select Committee on COVID-19 being set up with bipartisan support. That's a good thing. But in order for a committee to do its work it has to be properly informed. It needs to have access to information. You can't stand and say, 'It's okay, we've assisted and we've given our support to a committee,' but then, on the other hand, deny it relevant information for its line of inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to two claims which have been made by the government. The first goes to legal professional privilege. It's worthwhile understanding the purpose of the privilege. The purpose of the privilege allows for confidential discussions between a client and a lawyer. In this case, the lawyer will be either the Solicitor-General or the AGS, or perhaps a contracted lawyer. But the client is of course the Commonwealth government. One of the things that you can do in relation to legal professional privilege when you are the client, because the privilege belongs to you, is that you can simply waive the privilege. You can say, 'I accept that this is legal advice, but the release of this information will not cause harm so I wave my privilege.' That's the first thing that the government could do in these circumstances. Have a look at what the content of the legal advice is and, in the spirit of openness and transparency, simply waive the privilege.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that people stand up on a regular basis and say that this undermines the well-established doctrine. Well, the bottom line is that it does not. The doctrine permits the waiving of privilege. The client simply has to say, 'I agree to waive the privilege.' I might point out that on 2 March 1986 cabinet made a decision under the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department at the time, Mr Brazil—it's called the Brazil Direction. This was a direction from cabinet that, in actual fact, legal advice belongs to the government, paid for by the people, and only in circumstances where harm could be caused should it not be released. I invite people to have a look at the Brazil Direction. Study it and you'll see that there's no reason, unless there's harm caused, as to why legal advice can't simply be handed over. The minister did not stand up and say, 'This is the harm that would be caused by a particular piece of advice being given.' He didn't do that. He simply said that it would be harmful just because we do it and that would cause harm. That's wrong—that's simply wrong, I say to Minister Birmingham. I think he should go away and reflect on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of the equation, if you don't wish to waive privilege, is that the Senate has the power to order the production of legal advice. Earlier in this chamber—on Monday—I read out from the judgement in Egan and Chadwick in the Supreme Court of New South Wales where, unanimously, the appeals justices basically said that the New South Wales Legislative Council has the power to order the production of legal advice in circumstances where they believe it relates to the work that they carry out as a legislature, either in respect of considering legislation or in its oversight role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's no reason why the government should not hand over that advice. It is consistent with the doctrine of legal privilege and it is consistent with the rule of law in this country. Please don't stand up and say, 'An Attorney-General said this, therefore it is.' Why don't they listen to the justices within our legal system, who I think are much better qualified than people in this chamber to understand what the law of this land is? It would be good if the government complied with the law of this land. Unfortunately, they're not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the second aspect of some of the claims—the claim of cabinet in confidence—again, we should go back and look at the root purpose of cabinet in confidence. The dominant purpose of that protection is to protect the deliberations of cabinet—that is, the exchange of words between ministers across the cabinet table for the protection of what is referred to as collective responsibility. We allow ministers to have their opinions and say what they want to say about whatever is being talked about in cabinet, but the guiding insight is that there's collective responsibility. Once you walk out of the cabinet room, you adopt the position of the cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a protection around deliberation of cabinet, but there's also a ruling—again, in the civil jurisdiction—that deliberations are strictly the discussions that take place between ministers around the cabinet table. The cabinet rules—and I have looked into this in great detail—do not permit the deliberations of cabinet to be recorded on the minutes of cabinet. They can only be recorded by the note-takers, who then take the notebooks and lock them up. They send them to the archives, and we find out later what has been said. It is not possible for any minute from the cabinet or any decision of the cabinet to contain a deliberation, because that's not permitted under our cabinet rules. So claims that we see quite regularly thrown around—actually, I've got some challenges with the Information Commissioner in relation to some of these cavalier claims that these are deliberations of cabinet—are simply false because the only place deliberations of cabinet are recorded are in the notebooks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are accepted principles behind the keeping secret of cabinet decisions and cabinet ministers, but, again, understand what the law of this land is. I invite you to go and have a look at the case of Sankey v Whitlam in the High Court, where the High Court determined it is not for the cabinet to decide whether or not to keep cabinet documents secret in court proceedings; it is a matter for the court to do so. No-one in this country is immune from handing over documents or entitled to complete secrecy. If the interests of justice demand or require the adducing of cabinet documents then the High Court has said that is what will happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bret Walker SC—and I know the Attorney respects Bret Walker SC; he's engaged him in his matter that he's just initiated—gave a presentation here a couple of years ago that said the High Court has said that cabinet documents can be adduced in a court if the burden had been met or the interests of justice demand it. He also indicated that the same threshold test can be applied and the Senate has the ability to demand those documents as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems we've got here is that the government is simply very cavalier in all of its claims. I have brought into this chamber on at least one occasion and certainly have brought to a committee room a document that is cabinet in confidence according to a response to an order for production but that I got under FOI. You make the claims in such a cavalier manner, and they get overturned. My current score has gone up since the last time I spoke about this in the chamber. The current score on FOI appeals is Rex 7, governments 0. It's gone up by one. It is because you make all these claims that are not properly grounded in law that they get overturned. What happens is everyone understands now what you're doing. You're crying wolf. You cry wolf every time someone wants a piece of information. You inappropriately and unlawfully withhold that document. Again I say that transparency, to the Prime Minister, is like kryptonite to Superman.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to talk about the vaccine rollout. There's a lot of concern in the community, and that concern is centred on a number of issues to do with the vaccine rollout that has been badly handled by this government. We've had issues around overdosing, we've had issues around training and we've had issues around storage. And today, as I understand it, we've had issues with the launch of the booking system. Unfortunately, this seems to be par for the course for this government. It has been a confused, slow and uneven rollout of the COVID vaccination program across Australia and in my home state of Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think everyone would remember when the Prime Minister promised that four million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March this year. We know that over 160,000 vaccinations have been done, but we're a long way off four million. Senator Colbeck, in his response to Senator Dodson, did not respond at all to the question that was asked of him about the Prime Minister's commitment to Australians around vaccinations. To be completely fair to the Prime Minister, it did then morph into a commitment that four million would be vaccinated by the end of April. And then that commitment disappeared altogether. There have been commitments for six million vaccinations by 10 May and even 11 million by the end of May. If the rollout in Tasmania is anything to go by, the government is a long, long way from delivering on these commitments. The problem is that, despite months of planning, the systems to deliver the vaccine programs are still not in place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to go to the announcement that was made today and have a look at the electorate of Lyons. In Tasmania, there have been 36 GP clinics announced; in the electorate of Lyons, there have been only five. Now, Lyons contains 12 municipalities, and six of them have been left off the vaccination map. The government expects people living in the Derwent Valley, the southern midlands, Glamorgan and Spring Bay, Tasman, the central highlands and Kentish to travel considerable distances to get vaccinated—and of course that's if they can get an appointment and if the GP clinic has any available vaccine.</span>

There have been some website errors. I hope that the system stands up to the demand and doesn't suffer from the same fate as many of the other platforms that this government has run in the past, because they don't have a very good track record. I hope it does stand up, despite the early reports this afternoon, because it simply would not be good enough for the booking system to not be able to handle the demand.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  Here we go again: every single day, whatever it is, there can never be any recognition from those opposite that Australia has weathered the COVID pandemic better than all major advanced nations, in both economic and health terms. It doesn't matter where we're talking. It doesn't matter if we're looking at the $267 billion that's gone directly to economic and health support for Australians—we can't talk about the $267 billion that has benefited Australians through this pandemic without hearing doom and gloom from those opposite. And as everyone around the world has experienced when their vaccine programs have launched, it's been slow and steady as the vaccine rollout starts up. That's the sensible, medical based approach that's been taken around the world. But, yet again, the Labor Party have to come in with all their complaints, all their worries, all their concerns—which we know is part of their generalised faux outrage about everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One moment they're calling for the vaccine to be rolled out as fast as possible, and the next they're crying out about safety. We couldn't have consistency of message! We couldn't have anything that doesn't absolutely look like hypocrisy! We've seen it this week. At the March4Justice we saw Tanya Plibersek and Senator Waters—with Senator Waters being shuttered away by Tanya Plibersek as Kathy Sherriff tried to address the March. But: 'No, no, no; we only want to focus on one side as we politicise this issue.' Yet again, this hypocrisy is coming through, because one minute, 'The vaccine's not happening fast enough,' and the next minute, 'We're not sure how safe it's going to be; we need to make sure those in aged care have more surety, and we're not sure about each different type of vaccine.' Yet again the hypocrisy comes through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think you'd have a much better time, on a general day-to-day basis, if you just eased back on the anger about everything. The faux outrage must be exhausting. I mean, you really must be tired, and I do feel sorry for you all. For all of these Australians—the 164,000 who have received vaccines—the other side of this is that we in the Morrison government have ensured that we have sovereignty over vaccines, that we're able to produce our own vaccines and have sovereignty. We will not be beholden to exports from the world once we establish the production means that we have organised for the AstraZeneca vaccine to be delivered in a sovereign way to Australians. This domestic production will start with a delivery of one million per week from late March. But no, that's not good enough over here; they're going to have to get a little outraged up there. They probably don't like advanced manufacturing very much, either, and are probably not too happy about job creation happening in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard today, regarding JobKeeper, which opposition leader Albanese absolutely stated should be tapered out—but he's obviously a little distracted this week while he's trying to ignore a Facebook chat group—that they've changed their mind again. Living wages, handouts and subsidisation of industry are all part of your mantra. We want Australians to get back to normal life. We want pre-COVID existence to come back. We want Australians to have security in their own businesses and in their jobs. And that's going to happen through the vaccine. I'm sure you guys won't be lining up for it, as you've objected to it every step of the way. But I'm sure that, with more hypocrisy, you'll come through, because you'll be advocating confidence or whatever you're looking for as you criticise the rollout, as you criticise the safety.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I'm just going to inject a dose of reality into this debate, because it was sadly lacking from the performance of Senator Hughes. It was a bit of an alternative universe that Senator Hughes tried to create there, so I won't dwell on it too much. Suffice to say, if any of those Australians out there on JobKeeper saw that performance I'm sure they would be absolutely aghast that that is what the coalition senators are talking about in this important debate. You can make things up and you can throw all sorts of accusations, but what we saw today in question time was the collision of incompetence and neglect from this government, because the questions that we put about JobKeeper and the vaccine actually go to the collision of neglect and competence of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The neglect is focused on those hundreds of thousands of Australians who are going to be losing their jobs in 11 days when they cut JobKeeper. That goes to the neglect of this government. The fact is that they are prepared to sit back and basically ignore those people and let them fall onto the scrap heap, because they are not focused on those people. Then we see the incompetence—and this is the dangerous part, because the incompetence is going to have consequences. It goes to the vaccine, and we are angry about the vaccine. That's because they promised that four million doses would be done by March, and we're not going to get anywhere near that. We're also angry because their incompetence on policy solutions is going to ensure that those who rely on tourism are going to be worse off as well, which is going to make their cutting JobKeeper worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They try to say they've got solutions to these problems, but none of them are actually going to work. The vaccine is slow. Their policy prescriptions around tourism are diabolical and aren't actually going to fix that problem. They can't put a policy solution in place, they can't get the vaccines delivered on time and they are showing neglect for those Australians who are going to be cut off JobKeeper shortly. That will have a significant impact in Queensland. What we have seen is a level of arrogance from this government. When the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg, travelled to Cairns and Senator Green was there waiting for him, he had no policy solution. He had no detail about what he was going to roll out for the tourism industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 172,000 Queenslanders who rely on JobKeeper, and they are going to lose their payments in 11 days. That will actually cut $83 million a week from Queensland's economy. We can't afford to fall off a cliff when this ends. International borders remain closed, and we know the reason why, but the slow pace of the vaccine rollout is actually going to ensure that those international borders are closed for longer. What has been estimated across Australia is that 100,000 people will lose their jobs. We understand that a quarter of Queensland's 40,000 tourism businesses predict that they will go bust when JobKeeper ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is acting too quickly in removing JobKeeper, and it is too slow on the vaccine rollout. There is a level of incompetence when it comes to this. Currently around 203,000 Australians have been given doses. The Prime Minister promised there would be four million doses administered by the end of March. According to news reports, we are 2.1 million doses below the required level to meet that target of four million doses. Bloomberg has a list of all countries currently vaccinating, and Australia is currently 68th by the number of doses administered—behind Rwanda, Panama and Bulgaria, amongst many others. When you look at the doses per 100 people, Australia is tracking significantly below where South Korea, the EU, the US and the UK were when they were at the same stage of their vaccine rollout. There have also been media reports about the impact of this in regional Queensland, where doctors groups have said that they are only going to get 100,000 doses each week when they have 20,000 patients. So it is not going to do the job for those who need it the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've mentioned the incompetence on policy as well. The flights announcement has been a debacle from start to finish. We saw the Deputy Prime Minister unable to answer questions in the media last Sunday. They've had a few days to get their answers right on this. Again, in question time we saw the minister representing not actually provide that answer. It's no wonder that Australians are anxious about this government and their decisions. It is a mixture of incompetence and a dose of neglect, and it is the Australian people who are worse off. Unfortunately, because of the decisions that they are making, the ending of JobKeeper is going to have a devastating impact for many Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  Just as Australians are again confident that the future is bright and our best days in fact lie ahead, just as confidence returns to the Australian economy and just as we get assurance that, with the delivery of the vaccine, we will move to a post-COVID world, those opposite seek to undermine confidence in both the vaccine rollout and the strength of the Australian economic comeback which is so clearly on. In December, consumption was up 4.3 per cent and business investment was up 2.6 per cent, its strongest result since 2017. Dwelling investment, driven by the government's successful HomeBuilder package, is up 4.1 per cent, its strongest quarterly increase since 2015. We're not done yet. Also in the December quarter, direct economic support from the federal government was halved. That is half the amount of borrowed taxpayer money being injected into the economy, and yet at the same time the economy grew by 3.1 per cent, the second such quarter where we achieved economic growth of more than three per cent in a quarter since 1959. It's the first time since 1959 we have achieved two such quarters at that level of growth, and 2.1 million Australians graduated off the JobKeeper program. That's because this government stands for Australian business and a prosperous economy, allowing Australians to go about their business and do what they do best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite seek to undermine both the economic comeback and confidence in our vaccine rollout at such a critical time. Spare me the feigned indignation from over there. The JobKeeper program was always, as with everything that the government has done to stimulate the economy and shepherd it through the global pandemic, targeted and time limited. It was never intended to be permanent. Initially, the JobKeeper program was only planned for six months. Indeed, as we've heard today, the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said there would always need to be a taper. But, instead, this government extended it for 12 months and, at a cost of $90 billion, it's the single largest economic support program of any government since this nation was federated. There are 2.7 million Australians who have already had their jobs protected by the JobKeeper program, but then they graduated from that program and made their way in the world unabated. That is what this government's track record says. There were 100,000 new apprentices in the first five months of our successful JobMaker hiring credit. But we aren't done yet. As we've heard Minister Cash and the Prime Minister announce in recent days, we have expanded that program. This government is about jobs, lives and livelihoods. We have been unashamed about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the vaccine rollout, I'm pleased to advise the Senate that now more than 203,000 vaccines have been administered. That is a 10 per cent increase on the number of vaccinations delivered in Australia since yesterday. It's a more than 10 per cent increase in the last 24 hours. Five hundred and nine aged-care facilities and more than 45,000 of our most vulnerable Australians in aged care have received those vaccinations. That's despite the fact that we have only received 700,000 of our contracted 3.8 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses. Why? Because this government was the government that made the decision in August last year to ensure we had sovereign vaccine manufacturing capability so that, while there are countries that still find themselves in the depths of this crisis, like the UK, US and countries in Europe, where tens of thousands of people are dying every day, Australia finds itself with the capability to manufacture a vaccine right here in our own backyard.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rollout continues as we said it would. This government was clear that in February we would commence phase 1a. When did we do that? On 22 February. The AstraZeneca program was always scheduled to commence in March and—lo and behold!—we find ourselves about to commence phase 1b with the AstraZeneca vaccine four weeks after the commencement of 1a. Already more than a thousand general practices across this nation are ready to administer that vaccine. We're increasing the capability of the vaccine program by another 4,000 general practices over coming weeks. Rural and regional Australians have been considered, with the phases not applying in those isolated communities such that travel is not a problem. This government is about lives and livelihoods.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  It's interesting to hear the government talk about confidence, because in Cairns there is no confidence in this government. We know that the member for Leichhardt sits in the government party room. We know that the Treasurer and the minister for tourism visited Cairns. So maybe those three men would like to have a quiet word with the senators opposite and the members of the government party room, because in Cairns there is no confidence in this government. When they come in here and talk about how great everything is going, it shows how out of touch they are with the reality of what people in Far North Queensland are facing right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in Far North Queensland are listening to the words said in this place. They heard that the government promised four million vaccines by the end of March. They also heard that we would be fully vaccinated by the end of October. Well, it took two questions from Senator Gallagher over here the other day to find out that we will not be fully vaccinated by October. Why does that matter? Why does it matter that the government made promises and are not going to meet them? Nobody forced them to make these promises. Nobody forced them to make these commitments. Why does it matter? Well, the government have also said that international travel will return in October, in line with the vaccination program. There are people in my community who are listening to the promises the government is making about delivering four million vaccines, about making sure that all Australians are fully vaccinated by October, and they are planning their financial security and economic security around these promises. That's why it matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 11 days 8,000 workers in Cairns will lose JobKeeper. Cairns has the highest number of JobKeeper recipients of any postcode outside the big cities and their suburbs. I've heard the argument today from ministers answering questions that JobKeeper was always supposed to be temporary and targeted. Well, in terms of targeting, wouldn't you think that targeting JobKeeper and extending JobKeeper to one of the hardest hit communities in our country would be a good thing for this government to do? Absolutely, it would. But the government are not doing that. Instead, they've come up with some haphazard scheme—a scheme that they don't even have the details on yet. They haven't actually decided whether it's a cap, whether it's demand or what destinations will be on that list. The program to take the place of JobKeeper isn't even thought out, yet JobKeeper will be cut in 11 days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot from those opposite about what Labor is saying, but the tourism operators in Cairns have made many comments since the Morrison government made its so-called aviation announcement and in the lead-up to JobKeeper. Tony Baker, the managing director of Quicksilver, said that continued government support was needed to survive:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Anything that encourages visitors is great, but we still need some form of ongoing wage subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the federal government's aviation package, Perry Jones from Ocean Free sums up the concerns that many have: 'On 1 April if there is no-one on that boat there's no wages coming in.' Of the half-price flight scheme, he said, 'The only problem is that it doesn't mean they're going to be on my boat.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what these two tourism operators are saying publicly. What they are saying privately is that they have been left behind by this government, that they have no confidence in this government to deliver the vaccination rollout in the time line that they promised. No-one forced the government to make those promises, but they can't even live up to them. These operators are saying privately that they are terrified they are going to lose their jobs and they are going to lose their businesses. It is a major concern for people who have listened to what this government has said on the promises on vaccinations—four million vaccinations by the end of March, and fully vaccinated by the end of October. This government is not delivering on its promises.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Birmingham) to a question without notice asked by Senator Thorpe today relating to Aboriginal deaths in custody. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Calling what the minister gave an 'answer' is a bit rich, because it was not an answer at all. It was more platitudes and motherhood statements about how they care about ending Aboriginal deaths in custody, how they are taking action and how they are taking them 'seriously'. And then they say that they are sorry and that it's a tragedy. What a joke. Sorry means you don't do it again. We are sick of hearing this country saying sorry and continuing the genocide that started over 200 years ago. The minister had the gall to give his nonanswer to this chamber with one of the royal commissioners, Senator Dodson, present. Words are cheap. This government's words are even cheaper. They spend thousands on an empathy consultant, and that's the best they can do? Either this government is beyond help or the consultant wasn't any good. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are always rolling out their absolutely discredited, dodgy Deloitte review into the implementation of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, to congratulate themselves for implementing the recommendations. Well, that review is wrong! The review did not consult with Aboriginal people or Aboriginal organisations. It was a desktop review. Deloitte's review counted government action towards implementing a recommendation as having completed the recommendation. They couldn't even get that right. Let's be honest: they didn't even try. Yet they wheel out this absolutely dodgy review that was conducted in the dark, just so they can pat themselves on the back to tell us that they're taking action and that they care and that our lives matter. Yet three Aboriginal people died in custody last week, in one week! Well over 450 of us have died since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and well over 580 Aboriginal people have died in the last 40 years. There is not enough action; otherwise, it wouldn't be happening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country overtargets our people and has been doing so since the colonial project began in this country. Surely that constitutes ongoing genocide of this country's sovereign First Peoples? Just some weeks ago, countries at the United Nations absolutely slammed this country for overimprisoning our people. This country has targeted and overimprisoned us more than any other people on earth. The world is watching, Australia! The number of First Nations women in custody in particular has been called 'one of the most challenging human rights issues facing Australia'. Our women in this country represent the largest cohort of imprisoned people in the country, compromising approximately 34 per cent of the total number of female imprisoned people, despite making up only two per cent of the total population. Imprisoning our women, the keepers of our families, even for a day, causes immense distress and disturbance to family and community life. So many of our women are imprisoned for short sentences or non-violent offences—that is, when they are actually sentenced, because this country's prisons are heaving with thousands of unsentenced prisoners. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country is happy to be warehousing people in prison instead of supporting them out of poverty. This is not surprising, since the first thing that the white settlers did when they came to colonise was to turn our ancestral lands into prisons for their convicts. Not only are our women being warehoused in prison, they're subjected to ongoing violence when they're there, including sexual violence. We already know that the Prime Minister doesn't care about that, now, does he? Particularly when it's happening to black bodies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our people have the answers and the solutions to ending our overimprisonment. Come and speak to us; don't commission Deloitte to do a nonsense review so that you can pat yourselves on the back while hundreds of us are dying in prison cells. Shame!</span>

By the age of 15, Chris had lived on three continents, experiences which would shape his future and inform his worldly outlook. Chris helped to pioneer the widening of the Australian Labor Party and of the Labor movement, expanding, through his life, Labor's base beyond its traditional origins. He was a dedicated and strong believer in the Australian Labor Party and an active member of its South Australian branch, and indeed I acknowledge colleagues from the South Australia branch of the Labor Party on the other side here in the chamber and of course in the gallery.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris had been born on 30 July 1931 to Monty and Kathleen Hurford-Jones in Mhow in central India. His father, Monty, was an Englishman from Bristol who served in Gallipoli and France as an officer with the British Army. His mother, Kathleen, was an Australian whose father was a mining engineer. The two met in Rangoon, Burma, in 1919, marrying shortly thereafter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris spent his early years living in India, where his father was stationed after transferring from the British Army to the Indian Army. In 1940, Kathleen took Chris, then aged nine, and his younger brother to Western Australia to attend boarding school at the Jesuit Saint Louis School, where he remained until he was 14. During these years, Chris spent many of his school holidays on his grandparents property near Boyup Brook. His grandparents were a great influence on Chris's life, and the time spent on their property was where his love of country, rural and regional Australia blossomed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1945 the family travelled to England via three months in India to spend time with their father, who was stationed there until India gained its independence in 1947. Once they reached England, Chris attended The Oratory School near Reading to finish his education. When he was aged 18, the family moved back to Australia, settled in Western Australia and, while Chris sought to go to university, earning a living became the priority at the time. He began his working career as a trainee chartered accountant in Perth at Rankin, Morrison &amp; Co. However, a couple of years later, after receiving a telegram from an old school friend, he moved across the country to work in the mining industry in Broken Hill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Broken Hill introduced Chris to the trade union movement and was also where he completed his first accounting qualifications at the Broken Hill Technical College. After two years in the mining industry Chris had saved enough money to go back to England and study part-time at the London School of Economics, where he would later graduate with honours in economics. I doubt that the path from the mines of Broken Hill to the London School of Economics is an especially well-trodden one, or indeed has been trod by many others, if any. It is a testament to the work ethic and drive of Chris that he did make that remarkable journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his time in London he met his future wife, Lorna Seedsman, a social worker from South Australia. Chris and Lorna would later marry, in 1960, and together have five children. While in England, Chris's passion for politics developed and he joined the British Labour Party. In 1958, upon return to Sydney, he joined the local branch of the Australian Labor Party and a year later moved to Adelaide to be with Lorna, where he was tasked with reviving the Labor Party's North Adelaide branch. Chris would twice stand for the state electorate of Torrens, in both 1962 and 1965. Fortunately for him, he was unsuccessful both times. I say 'fortunately' because he was later quoted as saying he 'was bloody glad I didn't win because I wasn't really interested in state politics'—with apologies to Mr Atkinson in the gallery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris's unsuccessful attempts at state politics—and he's not the only one to have unsuccessful political attempts in their life, I say personally, and looking at you, Senator Farrell; I will come to that—would lead him to run for the federal electorate of Adelaide in 1969, defeating the then 25-year-old Liberal incumbent member for Adelaide, Andrew Jones. Chris Hurford would go on to win Adelaide at seven more elections—in 1972, 1975, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1984, and 1987—holding the electorate for 18 years through a remarkable series of wins. Notably, having won Adelaide from a Liberal MP, his successor candidate in the Adelaide by-election of 1988—I'm sorry to mention, Senator Farrell—lost Adelaide to the Liberal candidate, Michael Pratt, at that election. It's a testament to Chris that he held that seat for all those years between those two Liberal MPs, short lived though their careers were in the federal parliament. As a parliamentarian Chris served in many roles, including as Minister for Housing and Construction, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, as well as holding a number of roles in the shadow cabinet. Throughout this time he had many notable achievements. As the Minister for Housing and Construction he was responsible for the introduction of Labor's First Home Owners Scheme in 1983—going back to the opening remarks I made about his work in broadening Labor's base and the traditional origins of our side of politics under Menzies in seeking to make home ownership a core pillar of our party, this was a demonstration of the work that Chris Hurford did in reaching out to broaden the Labor Party base through policies such as the First Home Owners Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout his time as minister for immigration Australia saw a large increase in the intake of migrants. Chris Hurford played a key role in the development of the skills oriented aspects of Australia's immigration policy which would contribute not only to our success as one of the most multicultural nations in the world but also to the successful development of the social licence and support that underpin those immigration policies. Chris, of course, in that long service, had also been a member of the Whitlam government. During the Dismissal in 1975, on his way to question time, he had been confronted in the corridor and informed of what happened to him, reflecting what a very sad time it was for him at that stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After his service in the ministry and following the 1987 election, Chris was one of the longest-serving members of the ministry and of the Labor Party's parliamentary caucus, and he chose to leave the ministry to make way for new blood. Shortly after making that decision and retiring from the parliament, he was appointed as Australia's consul-general in New York, promoting Australia's interests there with distinction for four years. In returning to Adelaide and to South Australia, Chris accepted the offer of a role at the new University of South Australia, helping to establish a new and important institution, which has grown from those early years to serve so many South Australians and create new opportunities for so many. In 1993, in recognition of his service to the Australian parliament and to Australian-American cultural and commercial relations, Chris was awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many of us in this place, family was important to Chris, and I do recognise his family in the gallery today. He was a loved and cherished husband, father and grandfather. Equally, like for many having to come to Canberra, it was a challenge to be taken away from family. He spoke of taking the time to phone his children every day—something that I do and I know Senator Wong and many others in this place do, reaching out to keep contact with their loved ones. In our travels today that's a little easier than it was during the time of service for Chris and those who've gone before us. He was quoted talking about having to make those calls, wherever he was, from the hot phone boxes in Meekatharra or Port Hedland, or indeed anywhere around the country or the world, making the effort to maintain those connections. Reflecting beyond the work of his posting in New York, he noted the wonderful benefit that provided of allowing him to spend more time with his children, who would often spend long periods visiting or staying with him in those years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Christopher Hurford AO passed away on Sunday 15 November 2020, aged 89. His wife, Lorna, had passed away in 2005. Together, they had been married for over 45 years. Chris reflected, 'She had been my best friend for about 50 years.' Chris and Lorna are survived by their five children, Alex, David, Philippa, Kate and Richard, and eight grandchildren. On behalf of the Australian government and the Australian Senate, I extend to Chris's loves ones our gratitude for his service to our thankful nation and our sincerest condolences.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0N" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  I thank Senator Birmingham for his fine contribution to this condolence motion. I would also like to thank Senator Wong for allowing me to make this contribution on behalf of the Labor Party, because Chris Hurford was my friend, my mentor and a very important colleague. Chris was the Labor member for Adelaide from 1969 until 1987, and he passed away, as the minister has just indicated, on 15 November last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My abiding memory of Chris is of his big, generous smile. It would always cheer you up. And his good humour is and will continue to be sadly missed. Today's condolence motion—and I thank the President for this—has been timed to allow many of his family to be here with us today to honour the man. I guess it's appropriate, given Chris's mother's Irish heritage, that it's taking place on St Patrick's Day. Chris's daughter Alex; sons, David and Richard; daughters-in-law, Margaret and Emma; and grandchildren Georgia, Tom, Clare and Matt are all here with us in the gallery today. Chris's daughters Philippa and Kate and their families were unfortunately not able to travel to Canberra today, but I believe they will be watching from their home in Adelaide. To all of Chris's family I offer my deep personal condolences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris's funeral was held on one of those very hot Adelaide summer days—the sorts that are so vividly described by Peter Goldsworthy in his novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Dog Night</span>. The funeral was held under strict COVID conditions, unfortunately, so I was honoured to be one of the 50 people invited by the family to attend the funeral. Fittingly, his granddaughter, who is present here today, sang a touchingly poetic version of 'Summertime' from Gershwin's <span style="font-style:italic;">Porgy and Bess</span>, which I am told was one of Chris's favourite songs. Chris's early years, as I will explain shortly, were not what you'd necessarily think of as a typical Labor upbringing, so I've wondered since the funeral whether an interest in the issues of racial inequality, which are addressed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Porgy and Bess</span>, were perhaps one motivating factor in Chris's joining the progressive side of politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christopher John Hurford was born in India on 30 July 1931 to his English father, Monty, and his Australian mother, Kathleen. In 1940, shortly after the start of the Second World War, Chris's mother took him and his younger brother, Dave, from India to her home state of Western Australia by sea. The thinking was that the war would be short and that the boys could see it out in the care of their grandparents on a wheat farm in the state's South West. But the war, of course, was longer than expected, and for five years the brothers boarded at the Jesuit school of St Louis in Perth and for five years spent the school holidays on their grandfather's farm and on the coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1944, Chris's mother Kath returned to Australia to collect her sons, braving Japanese submarines in the Indian Ocean. They returned to India for three months before travelling to England, where Chris completed his schooling. In 1949, the whole family migrated to Western Australia, and they qualified as so-called ten-pound Poms because, of course, Chris's father was English.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris began training as a chartered accountant in Perth before moving to take up an accountancy job in Broken Hill, a town, of course, with a very strong trade union presence. From Broken Hill, where he was a very proud beneficiary of the lead bonus, Chris was able to return to England to study at the London School of Economics—established, of course, by the Fabians—on weekends. He supported himself by working as an accountant for Marks &amp; Spencer. It was during this time that Chris met the great love of his life and his future wife, Lorna, and by 1960 they were married and back living in Adelaide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lorna was a wonderful person and, like so many parliamentary spouses, she selflessly supported Chris and their children during his many trips to Canberra. She continued to do good works, especially with St Vincent de Paul, where she would often rope in my wife, until her untimely death in 2005. Chris of course was heartbroken, and I know the whole family still miss Lorna deeply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At his funeral, Chris's family spoke about how growing up exposed to the ruling British Raj in India and the caste system there, along with British boarding school and the class system, might have played a role in him becoming such a fine Labor man. Chris told his family about his time in Broken Hill, where he was in management but also in the union—although I suspect it was probably compulsory to join; he may not have had any choice, knowing Broken Hill as I do. And he drank and socialised in the union pubs, and that also played a big role in his future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris transferred his ALP membership from Sydney when he moved to Adelaide and was tasked with reviving the North Adelaide sub-branch of the ALP—no mean feat in the Playford gerrymandered South Australian electoral system of the time. As the minister said, he stood unsuccessfully for the safe Liberal seat of Torrens in 1962 and 1965. And, while he obviously lost, he gained respectable swings to Labor. He obviously impressed the machine that ran the South Australian branch of the Labor Party at that time: Geoff Virgo, Clyde Cameron and Jim Toohey. As a result, his efforts were rewarded in 1969 when he was elected as the federal member for Adelaide and entered the federal parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the 1940s, Adelaide had largely been a Labor-supporting seat, but it fell to Liberal, Andrew Jones, one of the youngest-ever members of the House of Representatives in the coalition's 'All the way with LBJ' landslide of 1966. But the people of Adelaide quickly realised their mistake. Jones proved unpopular and Chris regained the seat for the Labor Party with a resounding 14.3 per cent swing at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Don's Party</span> election of 1969. That's right, <span style="font-style:italic;">Don's Party</span>, that's when it was. It turned Adelaide into a safe Labor seat in one stroke, and Chris won enough votes on the first count to take the seat without the need for preferences. He held Adelaide until the end of 1987 when he resigned to become Australia's consul-general in New York. As the minister said, his resignation triggered the 1988 Adelaide by-election, the so called 'timed telephone call by-election'. That by-election became my first, very unsuccessful, run for parliament and I know he was very disappointed when we were unable to hold his seat on his departure—but the less said about that campaign the better!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to say a little bit about Chris's time in parliament. Being an accountant by trade it's perhaps unsurprising that one of Chris's first roles in the parliament was on the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts. He served on that committee from 1969 until 1973, including six months as chair of that committee. Chris's other committee service included chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Prices from May 1973 to November 1975; as a member of the House Standing Committee on the Standing Orders from 1975, and again from 1980 to 1983; and as a member of the expenditure committee in 1976.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Hawke Labor government was resoundingly elected in 1983, Chris was appointed Minister for Housing and Construction in the first Hawke ministry, from March 1983 until December 1984. He was promoted to cabinet in the second Hawke ministry as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs until February 1987. At that time, he replaced Don Grimes as Minister for Community Services, following Grimes's announcement that he would not seek re-election. Chris also served, importantly, as Minister assisting the Treasurer, where he helped out a very young and ambitious Paul Keating from May 1983 to July 1987. Chris made a significant contribution to the Hawke-Keating era that led to the opening up of the Australian economy, which itself led to almost 30 years of uninterrupted economic prosperity for this country. After the 1987 election, Chris withdrew from the third Hawke ministry. After retiring from parliament at the end of that year, he became Australia's consul-general in New York, a role that he performed with distinction for four years. Although still only in his early 60s, Chris never returned to public life as such after his return from New York, and I think that was probably a loss to South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, Michael Atkinson—who's in the chamber today—the former Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly and I would join Chris for lunch at his North Adelaide apartment, where we would spend the afternoon reminiscing about the good old days. I'd like to say a few words at a personal level about my friendship with Chris. I first met Chris when I joined the Labor Party in 1976. It seems like a very long time ago now. I lived then where I do now, in Little Sturt Street in Adelaide CBD, and Chris was my local federal member of parliament. For some reason Chris befriended me, a young lawyer for the shop assistants union, which wasn't an easy thing to do, with the memory of the Labor split of the 1950s still fresh in the minds of many in the ALP. The groundbreaking Dunstan decade was soon to come to an end. The ALP was split between the Centre Left, who backed Bill Hayden in South Australia, and the rampaging Left under Peter Duncan and Nick Bolkus. The Right, based on the shop assistants union, which <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span> journalist Randall Ashbourne said could conveniently meet in a telephone booth, was just beginning to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1984 Chris broke with the ruling Centre Left group around John Bannon and established Labor Unity at a meeting held at Chris's house in Finniss Street, North Adelaide, where all of his children grew up. In attendance were Bob Hawke supporters Graham Richardson and Simon Crean as well as locals Michael O'Brien, Paul Holloway, John Boag and me. It was a meeting that ultimately led to the modern South Australian Labor machine, which, with the Left's Patrick Conlon, led to an unbroken 16 years of Labor government in South Australia, the most successful government in the modern era. Our branch owes a sincere debt of gratitude to Chris Hurford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later Michael Atkinson joined us, a young <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span> journalist who became Attorney-General and Speaker of the South Australian parliament. On one occasion, as Labor Unity were beginning to grow, we were suddenly entitled to two national conference positions for an up-and-coming national conference meeting. Michael and I presumptuously decided that we would fill those two positions and go down to Tasmania and represent the group down there. However, Chris quickly disavowed us of that idea and made it clear that he would be a delegate, along with my boss, John Boag. Michael also reminded me this morning of a trip Chris took to Canberra, when he was surprised to see Ron Owens, the very burly secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation, sitting up at the pointy end of the plane. He expressed some surprise that Ron would be up there, and Ron, quick as a flash, said nothing was too good for the workers or their representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris's brand of sensible, progressive policies has of course set the branch up for a return to government, led by Peter Malinauskas, at the next state election. On behalf of the federal Labor Party, I wish to thank Chris for his contribution to our success and to the betterment of our nation. All of us can honour his memory by following the example that he set of working to reduce inequality and to make Australia a fairer place where people from all walks of life can share in the nation's prosperity. Chris Hurford was a fine, fine man and he will be sadly missed. May he rest in peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Streamlining these information sharing arrangements will create important efficiencies for the Disability Royal Commission, and future Royal Commissions. Currently, most evidence tendered before a Commonwealth Royal Commission, must also be tendered in a separate procedural hearing for each concurrent state Royal Commission. This ensures it can be relied upon in a single report, including the Final Report. Current arrangements are impractical and time consuming.

The Morrison government is determined to continue working to prevent babies from being born with FASD, supporting women and families to stop drinking if they are planning to have a baby and during pregnancy and helping babies born with this condition. We're investing nearly $24 million of funding for FASD diagnostic and support services, which is in addition to the $25 million announcement for a national awareness campaign on the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. These commitments bring the total government investment into the fight against FASD to more than $75 million since 2012.</span>

Rather than playing wedge politics, Labor advocates for the comprehensive protection of the environment and for secure jobs, and we are calling on the Morrison government to introduce strong national environmental standards, to establish a genuinely independent cop on the beat for Australia's environment and to fix the explosion in job and investment delays caused by their massive funding cuts to the department. Labor is the only party that will protect jobs and the environment.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation opposes this motion that highlights the hypocrisy of green wind power. The Robbins Island development will place 122 wind turbines on pristine coast land in north-west Tasmania. I can understand Senator Whish-Wilson's concerns at having 122 bird choppers sitting in the middle of a bird sanctuary. What could go wrong? Green jobs do exist, even if the only skill required is the ability to use a bucket and a spade. Robbins Island will generate power where we don't need it, then use a 115-kilometre high-voltage powerline to bring intermittent power into the grid. This transmission line will carve its way through sensitive coastal saltmarsh. The problem with this development is not only the avian carnage; Tasmanian devils are native to the area. Their habitat will be dug up to install the bases for the wind turbines and will then be covered in 30,000 tonnes of concrete. How green is that? It's time to put a stop to this green energy madness.</span>

                  </a>  The Senate notes the sentiments and concerns of those who marched yesterday and signed related petitions. That's why, since 2013, the government has committed more than $1 billion to reduce violence against women and children and is working on the next national plan. Along with other measures to support staff, we've appointed the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to conduct an independent review into the workplaces of parliamentarians and their staff. Politicians, like all Australians, have the right to the presumption of innocence, and we cannot support a dangerous precedent to stand down an individual merely on the basis of an allegation.</span>

The only hassle is that the covering clause of (1) says 'That the Senate'. I will just assume that can stand regardless of what happens. So, we are dealing with clause (1)(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), and then we'll deal with clauses (1)(b) and (2). So the question is that clause (1)(a) of motion No. 1064 be agreed to.</span>

The matter of public interest is the government's callous withdrawal of JobSeeker and JobKeeper, and it will have a particular effect on my home region of the New South Wales Central Coast. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a two-track economy. At business forums that I've been hosting around the Central Coast, I've been delighted to hear that local manufacturers, such as the bin company SULO, have been going gangbusters and are desperate for extra trained staff. Other businesses in our world-class tourism, arts and events sector are doing far, far worse. This is, indeed, a reflection of the profound patchiness of the recovery of some jobs, and there are also indications of further major problems from this government about the capacity for people who need to employ people to find workers to do the work. There's a litany of failures that have led to that reality in the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper was a vital part of the stimulus that halted the economic wrecking ball that COVID initially threatened. It was part of a stimulus that government, Labor and the union movement all worked together on in a rare act of bipartisanship, a vital stimulus of the same kind that the Liberal and National parties railed against in the GFC when Labor did it. But I would rather them be hypocrites than do the wrong thing for the country. They didn't want to do it. They didn't want to support JobKeeper and JobSeeker. But, ultimately, they pushed the panic button, recalled the parliament and responded to Labor's leadership on this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the height of the pandemic, the payments were sent out to 3.5 million workers, and that's nearly a third of the national workforce. It was done so to keep workers tied to their workplaces. Around 11,000 local businesses on the Central Coast of New South Wales are actually receiving JobKeeper. That's 47 per cent of all businesses on the Central Coast. So nearly half the businesses there are on JobKeeper. That means that thousands of Central Coast jobs are at risk when Scott Morrison and Mr Josh Frydenberg pull the rug out from under those businesses in just 11 days. In New South Wales, the NSW Business Chamber have reported that across the state 23 per cent of businesses that they surveyed believed they were at high risk of failure when supports such as JobKeeper ended. But you would never know that from the sorts of answers to questions we had today here in the chamber. That just further reflects a government completely out of touch with the reality of small businesses under incredible pressure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The businesses that are most likely to go under are, indeed, those small and medium enterprises which, pre-COVID-19, were the engine room of the Australian economy and, more particularly on the Central Coast, our great local employers. Independent economist Nicki Hutley thinks 100,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the JobKeeper cuts, which would also take around $5 billion out of the economy. Deloitte Access Economics also reported that around 40 per cent of all businesses in the hospitality, professional services and transport sectors do not have the cash reserves to cover more than three months of operation in the current environment. This clearly, for anybody who understands small business, is an unsustainable situation. There are particular industries that we absolutely need to save. This government has failed to do the work to locate the pressure points and deliver what is needed for small businesses across this country in any way that actually meets the demand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 12 February this year I visited the historic Avoca Beach picture theatre to speak to the wonderful owners, our local legends Beth and Norman Hunter. I spoke with them about the drastic effects of COVID-19 on their business and on all independent cinemas across the industry. They told me they were terrified about the effects of the cancellation of JobKeeper on their 30 staff members, and their complaints to the government on behalf of the sector continue to fall on deaf ears. They weren't just advocating for themselves; they were advocating for cinemas right across this country. We need to do far more to support local independent cinemas. No case of COVID-19 in the world has been contracted in a movie theatre. We need to support our local cinemas and local industries that are doing it tough. If you haven't been to the movies in a while, senators, I encourage you all to do so to support a local cinema. They need your assistance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that same day I also had the privilege to visit EI Productions, a proud family-run local business in West Gosford that provides expert lighting and technical expertise to live music productions. If you've been to a fantastic concert featuring a major Australian or international band, there's a pretty good chance that they were the ones who did the lighting and sound and gave you a great show. Pre pandemic, this business, based in my local area on the Central Coast, was one of the top performers in its field in Australia. But the shutdown of the live music industry and global travel have left this once-bustling business absolutely struggling. It's exactly the kind of business that JobKeeper was created to protect and is now being abandoned by this government. It was a competitive industry leader, now brought low not by wilful neglect or poor business techniques but by a once-in-a-generation pandemic that has crippled this specific industry. The government needs to listen. The government needs to support exactly these kinds of local businesses. The government needs to extend JobKeeper to hardworking Australians like Caroline and Neale Mace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry group representing the New South Wales events industry, Save NSW Events, recently surveyed their industry. They found out what the government couldn't hear—that is, 95 per cent of those businesses were on JobKeeper. The whole industry declined to the tune of almost 82 per cent from April to December 2020. The survey reported that 45 per cent of those companies will lay off staff and 42 per cent will have to close their doors when this government rips JobKeeper away. What they need is targeted support to keep their doors open till better times arrive. We cannot allow the two-track economy to continue; otherwise, we're going to have an incredible loss of capacity and devastation of job loss for those people who simply have nowhere to go and put their great skills to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government's decided to do to these businesses that have been struggling for more than 12 months with this massive downturn is give them another layer of debt, offering them loans instead of the support that they need right now. While it's better than nothing, it's going to mean that businesses taking on further debt to survive—with the vaccine rollout far away and increasing variants of the virus—will be forced by this government to take on liabilities in an increasingly insecure environment. These loans may even be rejected by banks on risk grounds, leaving businesses with no support whatsoever. The government's got pretty poor form on organising loan programs. The last one was so poorly organised and promoted that only five per cent of funds went out the door. But they announce the big sum, they get the razzle-dazzle announcement out of the way, and then the disaster follows behind closed doors. That's what they keep getting away with. But time's up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This sort of action isn't sufficient. It isn't smart policy. It isn't right. The data is there. The indicators are there. The peaks of the industries that are at risk are revealing the shape of need for small business in this country. But this government is blind and deaf when it comes to that and refuses to respond. Mr Morrison's government, which is not listening, and the invisible member Lucy Wicks have shut down the Ettalong Centrelink office at this time. Knowing for over two years that the lease was ending, they didn't find another location and instead let Centrelink go. This is a gut punch to people on the peninsula at a time when they absolutely need this office. We're approaching a cliff, with JobKeeper being withdrawn on 28 March. This government, who closed a Centrelink office, will bring businesses to the brink of disaster. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  Well, well, well! The fox is in the henhouse. Here we go. We've got Labor suddenly worried about small business. Get real! This is the fox that wants to destroy small business. This is the party that wants higher taxes. This is the party that wants higher energy prices. Just before, I put forward a motion to support nuclear energy, which would give us clean, green, baseload energy. No. What do they do? They want to vote against it, against another way to lower energy costs. If the Labor Party were really serious about small business, they'd vote with us on these IR reforms, which would help improve flexibility and give employees and employers the opportunity to get back to work—but, no, not the Labor Party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the Labor state premiers. What have they done? They have destroyed confidence and they have replaced it with fear. They have used COVID as a method of command and control. That is Labor's modus operandi all the time—to instil fear into everyone. I happen to know someone from the music industry. I've been talking to them very closely. They need open borders, they need consistent restrictions and they need some of those restrictions lifted. When you've got restrictions that vary between states, people aren't going to travel, because they don't know if they're going to get back home. The Labor Party keep going on about how businesses are going to hit the wall, how we don't really care. It's an insult. They're trying to attack the coalition, but I'll tell you who they're really attacking. They're attacking the taxpayer. In the last 12 months, the taxpayer has forked out a total of $250 billion to support small business and their employees. At some point—this is what Labor don't seem to understand—we have to start moving forward. JobKeeper and JobSeeker were all about protecting people while we locked down to get on top of COVID. That was in order to stay locked down. Now that we're on top of COVID we have to open up and we have to increase activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Neill stood there and said we don't listen. We have been listening. The overall feedback we've been getting from employers is that they can't get employees back to work. Part of the reason for that is a lot of employees have stayed home because of JobSeeker or JobKeeper. In regional Queensland they are screaming out for employees. While we continue to keep JobSeeker and JobKeeper going, it's going to encourage people to stay at home. Now we need to get people back to work. We accept that there's going to be an adjustment here somewhere, but we stand committed to supporting both employees and employers in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are all about fear and negativity. I'll tell you what business rely on most—confidence. It is all about confidence. The Labor Party over there are constantly talking down the economy, constantly talking down the government, constantly talking down our recovery, constantly talking about how bad everything is and making personal smears and the rest of it. That destroys confidence. That is the difference between this side of the chamber and that side of the chamber. We on this side of the chamber are optimists. We're positive. We're glass half-full people. We're not all negative and dreary—'The sky is falling in.' No. We say: 'Get out from under the doona. Get out there and enjoy the sunshine. Let's get on with it.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have talking points here. I didn't bother printing them all off, because there are 16 pages of talking points about just how much we have supported small business in the last 12 months and, to be quite frank, since the start of this country. Our whole party was founded on the 'Forgotten people' speech. It was all about small business. We on this side of the chamber understand that small business is the heart of capitalism. Small business is the heart of individualism. Small business is the heart of autonomy, independence, freedom, making up your own mind and choosing what you want to do with your life. Small business is the backbone of this economy. We have stood here shoulder to shoulder with small businesses to make sure that they survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fox comes in here, into the henhouse, and pretends that it's a chicken too—'Bwok, bwok, bwok'. No, I don't think so. We can see the fox here, and it is on that side of the chamber. The Labor Party hate small business. They have always imposed more regulation. They have sold the infrastructure that small business relies on to provide them with cheap energy and cheap water. You only have to look at what the state Labor government have done. They've sold all of our infrastructure to foreign owners. They do not build dams. Not only do they not build dams but they tear dams down. They have shut down small maternity wards in regional Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People don't want to go to regional Queensland. You won't get doctors going to regional Queensland. I was at the rural doctors lunch yesterday and the rural doctors were saying how families just won't move to regional towns because they don't want to go to a town where there are no good health services. You only have to look at Queensland Labor's record in shutting down over 30 maternity wards—many in towns that now have populations that are bigger—to know that Labor do not care about the little guy. I'll make an exception for Senators Sheldon and Sterle. I know those two guys care about the little guy, but the left wing of the party are all about telling small businesses how to live their lives and what they should be doing, increasing regulation and increasing taxes. That is not the way forward. I'm going to read out all the support that the coalition government has provided to small business. For a start—</span>

                  </a>  We don't have enough time. I'd have to move a motion to get the rest of the MPI time to go through it all. I'll go through a couple of pages. There are 16 pages here. There has been billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars of support courtesy of the taxpayer, who just happens to be small business, and courtesy of course of our children, who are going to have to pay some of this COVID debt off. We need to get business moving forward again so that we start paying the debt off and don't leave it to our children. It's the coalition government that has cut the tax rate for small and medium business from 27.5 per cent to 26 per cent. We've got a long way to go, because with holding rates we've got to lift. I'm working on that one; don't worry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What else have we done? We've also accelerated personal income tax. That matters. I'll tell you why. The lower the income tax is for individuals when you give a pay rise, the more money they get to keep in their pocket. That is a future benefit that flows through to the economy. We've also expanded small business tax concessions. Small business now can get an immediate write-off of 150 grand. I know farmers especially like that one because they can go buy a new tractor, new plough or whatever. So that's a really good one. As well as that, we've simplified our credit framework and improved access to finance. We've been supporting small business research and development, increasing the refundable research and development tax offset to 18½ per cent and removing the annual cash refund cap for small claimants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we've done is reform Australia's insolvency framework. We've enabled small business to get paid faster by introducing a payment times reporting framework and the procurement connected policy. That is really important because it is incredibly important that small business gets paid as quickly as possible to keep the cash rolling in. We've supported small business with tax disputes. We pushed back on the ATO. Like all bureaucrats, they tend to get a bit carried away and a bit Orwellian and dystopian in the way they like to bully small business. We've said: 'Enough's enough, boys. Just remember who's paying your wages.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've reduced the regulation and compliance costs. We've increased digital capability. We've invested in the mental health of business owners. We've worked to get our workplace relations settings right, which comes from these industrial relation laws, which are actually going to give more flexibility to both the employer and the employee. We've encouraged Australians to go local first. We've got to keep working on that. We need to do more work there, but we will go and do that. For this recovery scheme, we've increased the split from 50— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  Buried in that load of tripe from Senator Rennick was an admission that we're facing a massive austerity budget coming down the line. As we know, austerity doesn't work and, of course, it is the poorest of Australians who suffer the most under neoliberal austerity budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reports that the government is planning to extend their small business loans are yet another example of this government looking extremely busy but actually not doing very much. I want to be really clear: there is of course merit in extending the scheme. Many small businesses are likely to continue to struggle, all the more so once JobKeeper finishes at the end of this month. But, if the government—Senator Rennick would be interested in this, I feel—actually wanted to help small businesses, they'd go to one of the root causes of the problem: that Australia's financial system, aided and abetted by the big corporate banks, is rigged in favour of housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 30 years banks have gone from lending twice as much money to businesses as they did for housing to now lending twice as much money for housing as they do to businesses. Under the reign of the neoliberals Australia's financial system has gone from one that served the real economy by providing loans for productive enterprise to one that serves the speculators in the housing market by providing ever-larger loans for those investing in ever-increasing house prices. The Productivity Commission undertook an extensive inquiry into competition in the financial system just three years ago, and it found this: the reform that would most significantly improve small- to medium-enterprise access to finance would be changes to the underlying prudential requirements for SME lending compared with lending for residential mortgages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there you have it. You know the words. Fix the financial system so it's not rigged in favour of housing speculators. That's what we should be doing. Make it so that the banks aren't able to lend so much more against their capital holdings for housing as they are for small businesses. That would help put some balance back in the financial system and our economy in favour of people who are actually doing something with the money they're lent rather than betting and speculating on ever-increasing house prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not surprising that the government's small-business loan scheme has been oversubscribed. But there is no such issue in the housing market, I can assure you. Over the past 12 months, consumer lending for housing grew by 44 per cent, the highest rise over any 12-month period on record. In part, this is thanks to the RBA's ambivalence about the flow of credit. What has happened is this: the RBA has printed hundreds of billions of new dollars, pumped it into the financial system and said to the banks, 'Basically, you can do what you like with it.' Not surprisingly, with spending down and business confidence low, the banks have said, 'Oh, well, we'll stick that money into the housing market.' No wonder an entire generation of young people are being priced out of the great Australian dream of owning their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But even that is not enough for the Liberal and National parties in here and their corporate banking masters, despite the largest increase in consumer lending on record, an increase in risky lending, according to APRA figures released just yesterday. The government has introduced legislation to abolish responsible-lending laws to make it even easier for the banks to lend money. This government and their corporate banking masters want even more money to flow into one of the most overpriced housing markets on the planet. Like just about everything this government have done in response to the pandemic, their plans to rip up responsible-lending laws are, firstly, all about helping their big corporate mates and, secondly, leaving ordinary Australians to fend for themselves—and that of course includes small business. What small business really needs is the same as what everyone else needs, which is for the Liberal and National parties to stop acting as agents of the big corporate banks in this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need the rules in the financial system and the tax system to be rewritten so that we reward and support productive enterprise and the rapid transition to a zero-carbon future, and we stop rewarding and supporting financialised capitalism and all the other corporate rent seekers who will not stop until they have taken control of every corner of our economic system.</span>

                  <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I want to thank Senator McKim for his contribution to this debate, considering the one we had earlier from Senator Rennick. I also rise to speak on this matter of public importance that's been brought before the Senate today, and surely just a few days away from this government's premature ending of JobKeeper. This matter could not be of any more public importance than it is right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the past 12 months, JobKeeper has been a lifeline for millions of Australians right around the country. This time last year, as many of our fellow Australians faced the prospect of losing their livelihoods, to have JobKeeper there to support them at that time could not have been more important. As important as it was then, it remains so now. Whilst it is certainly the case that in some areas of the economy there has been a steady transition towards relative normality, for many the future continues to remain uncertain. In fact, it is estimated that in my home state of Victoria the premature ending of JobKeeper will impact upon 134,000 businesses employing around 413,000 workers—almost half a million workers in my state alone. For those 413,000 workers, the same concerns they had this time last year persist today. For those workers, transitioning to relative normality may have been a fortunate thing. But it is not an option. Some of them may work in retail, in hospitality, in restaurants, in tourism. But that is by no means the extent of it. Many industries other than those will be affected by this decision of the coalition government, and that is because for them the recovery, such as it is, is yet to be realised. For them the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and this couldn't be more the case than it is in my home state, where the pandemic has brought quite profound disruption. Whilst those in other states were at bars, at cafes and at restaurants, roaming their regions or simply getting on with their lives as best they could, Victorians, through no fault of their own, were mostly confined to their homes, only in rare instances permitted to stray just five kilometres beyond their local area. I was obviously one of those Victorian, and take it from me: the economic effects of this remain. The support that was put in place, particularly JobKeeper, continues to be welcome and it is, quite frankly, needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One must ask oneself: what could possibly possess this government to think that cutting the safety net for these workers whilst they remain dependent on it is a good idea? We've heard from members across the aisle justification after justification. But the reality is there are people who will do it tough, who will struggle, who need that support from their government. That is why they pay their taxes and they look to government for support. They look to all of us here in Canberra to provide that support. What kind of government would seek to throw 413,418 working families into financial peril? I suppose, when one ponders the question, it should be hardly surprising that we see this government, this coalition government—of all governments—seeking to undertake such an action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us in this place and this country not forget that JobKeeper was never a proposal that those opposite were prepared to embrace. In fact, when it was initially proposed by those in the Labor movement, those on my side of the chamber and the crossbench, it was dismissed out of hand by this government. The Prime Minister on 25 March last year said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The best way to get help to people is through the existing payment channels … To dream up other schemes can be very dangerous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Dangerous' is what the Prime Minister said. What Australian workers saw as a lifejacket in a stormy sea, the Prime Minister saw as dangerous. As we have seen, JobKeeper has been anything but dangerous. Rather, it's been one of the most positive things to have come out of this place in quite some time. Thank goodness those beside me and around me, those in the community, never gave up on the fight for its establishment, and thank goodness that together we were able to successfully drag this government to the table. It is owing to those efforts that so many have been able to rely on the support they needed to get through. These are essential workers who every morning would get up to make sure that our supermarket shelves were stocked or our nurses on the front line at hospitals making sure that people got tested for COVID. These are the very people who rely on this payment along with the people that they live with or share their homes with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of many of the efforts being put in place that so many businesses, in particular small businesses, have remained afloat and so many workers remain connected to their place of work. It is a good thing that they are able to provide for their families, able to support the many local businesses that are reliant on local families and able to support their local communities in regional Australia. But the question that remains for us and for those who still require such assistance is: what is to become of them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the coalition government has recently unveiled its SME Recovery Loan Scheme. For those listening who are unfamiliar with the SME Recovery Loan Scheme, this is an initiative in which the government will seek to work with lenders to ensure that certain eligible businesses will have access to finance to get them through the many tough times ahead. But no matter how this coalition government might seek to dress up this scheme, it is by no means a like-for-like swap with JobKeeper. I can assure you that if you were the owner of a small or medium-sized business or, indeed, a worker in one of those small or medium-sized businesses, you would by no means be looking forward to what is to come in just 11 days time, when JobKeeper is scrapped. We know just how important that certainty is to business, big or small. I don't think you would have to convince anyone of just how important it is that, when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, we get the recovery right. Indeed, how we get out of this is crucial to guaranteeing our nation's future economic prosperity. At the end of the day that is all we want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The success of Australian business is central to this. I know that the shadow minister for small business, Matt Keogh, has spoken at length with business owners from all around the country about their concerns. Should the government persist in scrapping JobKeeper without the provision of targeted additional measures, many of these businesses will close. This will have an effect not just on the businesses concerned and those directly employed by them but on other businesses that might rely on those businesses, too, and the indirect jobs that may be lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has certainly made its own suggestions about what the government might do to improve JobKeeper. We have sought to work constructively with those opposite. Sadly, the government has not been forthcoming on this and, instead, in conjunction with other proposed legislative changes before this place, has sought to maintain an ongoing ideological crusade against working people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  Labor's relentless negativity appears to know no bounds, and today's matter of public importance, put forward by Senator McCarthy, is another example of this relentless negativity. Labor's newfound interest in small business is welcome, but, like all of Labor's business statements, there's no actual substance or actual policy initiative put forward. It is just criticism after criticism after criticism. On the one hand, Labor told us—and, might I add, quite rightly, in a rare lucid moment—that JobKeeper needed to be rolled back. As we announced JobKeeper we said it would be a temporary measure to assist us through the immediate crisis, would be tapered off and then would need to be stopped. Labor actually agreed with that at one stage, in one of their rare lucid moments in this space. But, of course, it doesn't take them long to try to play the populist card, the relentless negativity, and somehow suggest that the money for JobKeeper can just keep flowing and flowing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens don't seem to recognise that, through this pandemic, massive borrowings have been undertaken, all of which need to be repaid—repaid, I suggest, by the next generation and, chances are, the generation after that. Therefore, we have to be exceptionally circumspect to ensure that the debt burden inflicted on the next generation, or generations, is as limited as possible. To do otherwise would be intergenerational theft, and this parliament would be abrogating its duty and its responsibility to the next generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The topic that we have before us is this sort of glib dismissal of our small and medium enterprise support scheme. The topic says that somehow all we've done is rebadge it without dealing with the significant measures that are contained therein to ensure that our small and medium enterprises, the ones that we on this side seek to champion, are able to be maintained, because small and medium enterprises—employers as they are—are called employers for a very simple reason: they employ people, and jobs are the lifeblood of our community. Jobs provide the individuals who have those jobs with better mental health, physical health, self-esteem and social interaction outcomes, and they do that for everybody who lives in a household with somebody who is gainfully employed. So, in pursuing our economic measures, it is not because we believe in economic purity that we so pursue them; we pursue them because of the social dividend that is delivered by good, sound economic management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say it was somewhat galling to have to listen to Senator McKim, who was one of the failed ministers of the Greens-Labor government in my home state of Tasmania that left its economy as a smoking ruin in recession. But, with the election of the Abbott government and then the Hodgman government, Tasmania has been able to go from recession to the turnaround state and, today, the standout state. These things don't happen by accident. Recessions usually occur because of bad economic management. The turnaround has occurred because of good economic management by Prime Minister Abbott and Premier Hodgman, now built on by Prime Minister Morrison and Premier Gutwein.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as well, we were told by the Greens contribution that somehow the financial sector was rigged in favour of the housing sector. Well, if it were rigged in favour of the housing sector, one would assume that more and more houses were being built and, if it were not so rigged, as Senator McKim describes it, there would be fewer houses being built. But how often do the Greens issue their press releases, like confetti, complaining about homelessness and the lack of housing availability? They really have this capacity, as is the wont of the Left in this country and, indeed, elsewhere, to talk out of both sides of their mouth. On the one side they say there's a housing crisis and we need more houses; on the other side, when it suits them, they say that the financial system is skewed in favour of creating too much housing. I don't care what your story is, just keep it consistent. Give us an actual position on these matters. You can't claim credibility in this space and assert there aren't enough houses and then simultaneously assert that too many houses are being built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I turn to Senator Ciccone's contribution, which started, not surprisingly, by thanking the Greens for their contribution. The Labor Party and the Greens cannot help themselves. They continue to be in lock step, especially when it comes to bad economic management. I don't know what the attraction is, but it is a fatal attraction. We have seen the results in my home state of Tasmania, and I would never want to see it inflicted at the national level. But, in the moments remaining, I will note that that which the Labor Party seeks to dismiss as simple rebadging includes such things as having the SME Recovery Loan Scheme increase from the current 50-50 split between the government and the banks to an 80-20 split, which will encourage more banks to support small businesses. It demonstrates the government's commitment to back those businesses that are prepared to back themselves. This is clear, good, positive policy that is simply dismissed by those economic illiterates on the other side as rebadging. I dare say they use that terminology because they don't understand the significance, importance and value of these sorts of initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The expanded scheme will also increase the size of eligible loans from $1 million under the current scheme to $5 million, and maximum eligible turnover will increase from $50 million to $250 million. In anybody's language, these are significant changes to the scheme, but they are simply and ignorantly dismissed as rebadging. Is it really the case that Labor don't understand or haven't looked at the significance of these policy changes? Similarly, the maximum loan terms under the expanded scheme will be increased from five years to 10 years, providing businesses and lenders with greater flexibility and certainty. The expanded scheme will also allow lenders to offer borrowers a repayment holiday of up to 24 months. All of these fantastic initiatives are simply dismissed as rebadging. Eligible businesses will also be able to use the scheme to refinance existing loans—another great assistance. This allows SMEs to access more concessional interest rates available under the program and to better manage their cash flows through an extended loan term and lower combined repayments. These are targeted, focused enhancements with real outcomes, but they are simply dismissed by Labor as rebadging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You really can't take the mob opposite seriously when it comes to economic management, which in turn means employment and self-sufficiency for our fellow Australians. You've got to give it to the Labor Party—when it comes to spin, chances are there's no-one better. But, when it comes to sound economic policy, that is where they are found wanting. The Australian people are awake to them. They understand that JobKeeper funding cannot keep going. They do know that the fundamental underpinnings for SMEs to keep people in employment are required, and that is what we are delivering.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  To the millions of Australians out there who have received their $700-a-week JobKeeper payment during the last nine months, who have been able to get on with their lives and have some certainty that they can pay their mortgage and put food on the table, you might be tempted to think that you owe the Liberal government for paying you this stimulus package during this difficult time. But it's really important for you to know that this wasn't the Liberal government's idea. It was many people coming together to find a solution at a time of crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to say that the Greens were the first to raise the concept of a living wage and, at that particular time, to push the Treasurer and the finance minister to adopt a New Zealand-style or UK-style living wage, which ended up being JobKeeper. The union movement were out there advocating for a living wage. The business community were advocating for a living wage. We had this unique time in history when everyone was working together for the national interest. I remember putting out a media release on the day of the government's first stimulus package, saying we need to go further; we need to have a living wage to keep businesses going, to keep workers in certainty during this pandemic. It took two weeks for the government to come on board with the idea. And do you know what? I'm very glad they did. But they can't claim credit for this scheme, which has kept the economy going for the last nine months. It's not perfect. Nowhere near enough people got it. It was cruel and unfair in many ways that cohorts were excluded for political reasons. There were a lot of other problems with it, but let's be honest: it was a difficult time; we've never done this before.</span>

We need to be very clear from here that we're not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot. While government regulations are in place around travel, border closures and restrictions, small business and workers will still suffer. We need to give them certainty. While government regulations are in place around travel, border closures and restrictions small business will still suffer and workers will still suffer. We need to give them certainty and we need to let them know that we have got their backs. I'm prepared to work across political lines with anyone in this chamber to make sure that happens. Let's keep the cooperative politics at the heart of what we do, not political conflict.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  There is a clear need for this government to explain how rebadging this inadequate loan scheme will be good enough for the tens of thousands of struggling small businesses that are indeed staring down the barrel of JobKeeper cuts on 28 March. This is the government's third attempt at its SME loans scheme, a scheme that has already proven not to be working. The Treasurer has said that it will help small businesses to stand on their own two feet as we recover. However, what we see here is a government that's prepared, really, to push small businesses in Australia further into debt. We know that financing and access to finance are important, but we also know that this lumpy response—this particular solution—which has been given by the government, which they've been pushed into doing, isn't working particularly well so far. Indeed, I can't see it playing a meaningful role, given the government's inadequate explanation of its role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer is being disingenuous. He says it's about small businesses standing on their own two feet when the government is stimulating their activity by pushing them into greater debt. The government is guaranteeing a higher proportion of the loan—the fifty-fifty split with banks shifts to an 80-20 split—but, as we know, taking on more debt will only be good if you can pay it back. While holidays from debt repayments et cetera can be important, they simply do not lift the economic burden off these small businesses in a way that's meaningful. Nothing more is being done for small businesses than allowing them to be pushed into more significant debt. There's no direct funding support anymore with the end of JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this unpopular and inadequate scheme being extended? The government promised some $40 billion in small-business assistance, but the government has confirmed in its own figures that only $3 billion has been lent under the existing scheme over the last year. We know that the revised scheme opened in October and extended the loan terms and loan size, and that only 39 lenders signed up, and the second version has only 44 lenders signing up. Since the revised August scheme to 20 January this year there have been fewer than 3,000 new loans, worth less than $300 million under the new terms. We know that JobKeeper is being cut on 28 March; the Morrison government is cutting this direct support and asking small businesses to take on further debt to continue to employ people from an already grossly undersubscribed scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the government needs to be seen as pointing to something that it's doing. It will say, 'Oh, we've got this loans scheme as we end JobKeeper.' What we also know is that, with JobKeeper ending, the JobSeeker rates are also now heading right back down—pretty much to what they were before. This is not economic stimulus for our nation and it's not wage growth for our nation, which would see small businesses benefiting from boosted consumption in our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Labor Party, we have made every effort to help small businesses and will continue to do so. We want this version of the scheme to work better than the last, but we believe very strongly that we also need direct support. What the government is offering is not a lifeline for small business; it's a death sentence. Small businesses and their workers deserve a real plan from this government, a comprehensive plan to help them through this health pandemic that's limiting economic activity in our nation, not a promise of more debt. The Reserve Bank governor has predicted some job shedding once JobKeeper ends and, of these workers and employees of businesses and, indeed, these very businesses, there are many that simply won't make it. They'll be on this manifestly inadequate JobSeeker amount. A third version of this unpopular scheme is simply not good enough— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I would like to commend Labor for finally acknowledging our small business community. This is the same party that, last election, offered nothing for small business except more union power and increased costs of doing business. Since that election, small business has not featured in Labor's policy manifesto whatsoever. Yet here they are today, proclaiming to be the champions of small business. But, as usual, Labor are being opportunistic and unrealistic. They would have us indefinitely fund JobKeeper at the expense of real business support mechanisms we have put in place to create jobs. We heard today from Senator Birmingham that over 800,000 jobs have been created in Australia in the last six months alone. Unlike Labor, we have a history of supporting small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ever since the coalition came back to power in 2013, we have delivered a range of policies and initiatives to make it easier to establish, operate and grow small businesses in Australia. Our policies enabled small businesses to create over 1.5 million new jobs between 2013 and the start of the pandemic. As a National, I know all too well that our regional economies, in particular, are almost entirely dependent on small businesses. From farmers to boutiques, bakeries to consultancies, hairdressers and plumbers, our small businesses keep our economy and our communities going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has been particularly crippling, particularly in the regions. These are regions almost untouched by the pandemic itself that have faced the same lockdowns, the same business closures and the same restrictions that have been imposed to manage the pandemic in urban areas. For border communities in particular, the haphazard state imposed border lockdowns and restrictions that have come off and on and off again have been particularly crippling. It's made it impossible for businesses to try to manage and plan for the future. And they've done so with no state compensation whatsoever, except for New South Wales, which established the Southern Border Small Business Support Grant. I commend the New South Wales government for recognising the impact that state restrictions have had on our small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of the pandemic, our government understood that our economic recovery would be dependent on the thousands of small businesses across our nation. That's why we swung into action to support them throughout, and our measures have worked. JobKeeper was only one of those measures, and it was always temporary. Other measures we've put in place include tax credits for small businesses. Over 800,000 small businesses received $35 billion in tax credits. Labor likes to talk about the 'cut' to JobKeeper, but let's talk about the real cuts—the tax cut from 30 per cent to 26 per cent for turnovers of less than $50 million and the personal income tax cut. These are the cuts that put money back into people's pockets. The $4.9 billion tax relief through temporary loss carry-back allows companies to write off their bad years against good years—so important after the year that was. And, yes, there's the small and medium enterprise loan guarantee scheme. I thank Labor for highlighting this very good and very popular policy. It has already supported 35,000 loans worth more than $3 billion for our small businesses. The improvements and the extensions we're making to this scheme are wanted, have been asked for and will succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must remember JobKeeper was always targeted and temporary. It was there to see us through the worst of the pandemic. Thankfully, our worst has been nothing like the worst seen in other nations. Thankfully, Australia, due to our good management of the pandemic, is ready to rebuild. As we rebuild, our government will continue to support small businesses. I remind anyone listening that the best way they can support small business is to buy local and support local. Support your small businesses. Get a coffee from the cafe, get your hair done down the street and support your local small businesses. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I ask an associated question—a connected question, yet a far bigger question. My question is: even if the loan scheme is adequate, what about the big picture—that is, restoring our productive capacity in this country? Look at our electricity prices—fundamental for manufacturing, fundamental for agriculture and many other areas. Energy is the key; it's the primary driver of productive capacity. We've gone from the lowest-cost electricity in the world to the highest-cost electricity. It makes us uncompetitive. Liberal, Labor and the Nationals did that together: the Renewable Energy Target; state and federal retail schemes; the gold-plated networks; the National Electricity Market, which is really a national electricity racket; privatisation; anti-coal policies from Liberal, Labor and the Nationals; taxation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe Hockey said not so long ago, 'People work from January to June to pay the tax man, and the rest they keep for the rest of the year.' It's actually worse than that. It's about 68 per cent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics back in the late nineties and early 2000s. A person on an average income in Australia works from Monday to smoko on Thursday morning just to pay for rates, fees, levies, taxes, super charges and all the rest of it. We need to do something about that, especially when 90 per cent of our large companies are foreign owned and have paid little or no tax since 1953.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is overregulation and the control of so many of our assets, private assets, in the hands of government. There is the Fair Work Act, for example, which I'll talk about later. The lack of water infrastructure. The governance of this country. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority destroying the Murray-Darling Basin. The loss of property rights under Labor, Liberal and Nationals regimes. These, and so many other things, are destroying the governance of our country and our productive capacity. Governance in this country is now based upon satisfying vested interests, unfounded opinions, emotions, fears, ideology. It's not based on data. It's quite often contrary to the data.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loan scheme may or may not be inadequate for Australian businesses and workers, but the mountain we all have to climb here is stupid, reckless, counterproductive government. We need to restore our country's productive capacity.</span>

I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, together with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of the proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report makes 32 recommendations. This issue was referred to the Community Affairs References Committee more than 12 months ago, actually. It's an issue that the committee have long taken an interest in, and we took longer than we expected, obviously, because of the COVID pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, otherwise known as FASD, is an entirely preventable permanent disability. FASD includes a range of physical and neurological impairments occurring due to brain damage caused by exposing a fetus to alcohol during pregnancy. As a spectrum disorder, FASD manifests in a range of ways, and conditions can range from very mild to severe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that FASD is still not well understood or recognised in Australia. I'll come back to that, because that's particularly important. It is frequently called an invisible epidemic. The evidence indicates that the human, social and economic costs of FASD are immense. There is no safe level of alcohol that can be consumed during pregnancy. You'd think that by now in Australia we would get this, but we still have significant problems in that particular area, which is why we say that this is an entirely preventable disability. There are many myths regarding the so-called 'safe' use of alcohol during pregnancy that have been circulated in the community for a long time, including, I must say, by some health professionals and, most notably, the alcohol industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prevention efforts must fundamentally aim to shift societal attitudes and behaviour around alcohol consumption in the broader Australian community. The committee recommends a long-term strategy and funding for FASD awareness and education, including in secondary school curriculums. In other words, we have to start making sure that people understand the harms caused by alcohol but also, specifically, the harms caused by alcohol in pregnancy. The evidence we received is that this doesn't just affect the fetus in utero. In other words, it's not just a message that's relevant to women but also an important message for men because it affects sperm as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important that we raise awareness around alcohol consumption and FASD. The announcement of mandatory pregnancy warning labels on alcohol products and packaging during this inquiry was a long time coming, and we were pleased to see it. The committee urges alcohol companies to promptly implement the mandatory labels before the deadline in July 2023. It's not as if the industry don't know that they should have been doing this a long time ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health professionals play a key role in prevention, diagnosis, and support for people with FASD and their families. Interactions with pregnant women and women of child-bearing age provide opportunities to educate women and their partners about the risks of maternal alcohol consumption and influence behaviour change. However, for a range of reasons, including stigma and a lack of understanding, health professionals do not always discuss alcohol with women or provide accurate advice or referrals. The committee is of the view that building the capacity of health professionals to identify and prevent harmful alcohol consumption during pregnancy must be prioritised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was especially alarmed by the evidence the committee received around online marketing of alcohol being used to microtarget particular cohorts. FARE commented that during the COVID-19 pandemic their analysis of Facebook and Instagram during a one-hour period showed an alcohol ad every 35 seconds. Almost a quarter of these referred specifically to the pandemic. What's happening is people are ordering alcohol online. This data is being collected and enabling this microtargeting. It's a very significant issue. There are serious conflicts of interest which mean industry managed processes could not properly restrict alcohol marketing in an effective manner. We need to be doing a lot more than just having a regulatory code, which has so many loopholes in alcohol advertising. It's clear we need a new approach to controlling alcohol marketing, especially online marketing. This, in fact, is to address not just FASD but also other, broader issues related to alcohol and its harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">FASD is often not identified early in life. In fact, sometimes it's not identified at all. As a result, many people do not receive recognition of their disability or, very, very importantly, access to the support that they will need, and that needs to be lifelong support. Diagnosing FASD is complex and involves a multidisciplinary team. The committee heard that there are limited multidisciplinary FASD diagnostic services in Australia and waiting lists are very long. There's a clear need to ensure FASD diagnosis is more widely available across Australia. This includes building and training the health workforce involved in FASD diagnosis and exploring alternative models of assessment and the use of technology. Supports for a person with FASD will necessarily be, as I just indicated, over the entire life course. Unfortunately, support services in Australia are limited and can be cost prohibitive. Throughout the inquiry, the committee was made aware of the difficulties in accessing support through the education system, the NDIS and the social security system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee agrees with submitters that FASD must be specifically recognised as a disability by the Australian government and the social security system. Access to assistance must be urgently improved to help people with FASD and their families to meet the extensive costs of FASD supports. The committee report also talks about the interaction of people with FASD with the justice system and also with the child protection system. It's very clear that we need to improve those interactions. As I indicated, we made 32 recommendations, but we also touched on the need to improve interactions between the justice system and the child protection system and the need to screen people—young people in particular—going into the justice system and also into the child protection system. We heard some very moving and emotional evidence from the carers of young children who have gone into the care system. They have not been screened and they are not getting adequate support for, in some cases, babies and young children whom they are providing care for. They weren't even given an indication that children potentially going into care in fact had FASD.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw some outstanding examples of work that's being done, including in the Marulu Strategy in Fitzroy Crossing, which has done an outstanding job of identifying issues around FASD. I personally will be fascinated to see the outcome of their 10-year follow-up study that we've just heard is occurring. I'm sure the people who were involved in the inquiry will be watching that very closely. We need much more data on FASD. We need a prevalence study. We still don't have an understanding of the prevalence of FASD in this country and we have a lack of data. It's absolutely essential that we address that issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, I think, a very important committee report. In fact, I thank the Acting Deputy Chair, Senator Griff, who initiated this inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. I'd particularly like to thank all the witnesses and those who gave us submissions. They provided us with absolutely essential information. I apologise to the people in both Alice Springs and Fitzroy Crossing; because of COVID, we didn't actually make it up there for the site visits that we were so looking forward to. There are a number of committee members who still want to come up. I particularly want to thank the secretariat, who, once again, have gone above and beyond. They have produced an outstanding report and supported us very, very well. If no-one else wants to speak, I'll seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The internet has brought extraordinary economic, social and educational benefits, which each of us enjoy each day. However, these benefits will only be fully realised if Australians can engage confidently and safely in the online world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, our Government established the Children's eSafety Commissioner to support Australian children experiencing cyber-bullying harm. In 2017, we expanded the Commissioner's remit to include all Australians and introduced a strong scheme to support victims of image-based abuse and the role became the eSafety Commissioner. Over its six years of operation the eSafety Commissioner has established a strong reputation as an effective regulator providing swift, practical assistance to people who have been exposed to harm online. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill strengthens Australia's world-leading online safety framework by adopting and building on the effective elements of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015</span> and Schedules 5 and 7 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</span>. This Bill also provides new powers for the eSafety Commissioner to tackle a range of emerging online harms, within a flexible and adaptive framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will establish a world first cyber-abuse take down scheme for Australian adults, based on the success of our cyber-bullying scheme for children. This new scheme provides a pathway for those experiencing the most seriously harmful online abuse to have this material removed from the internet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The scheme will operate on the basis of complaints made to the eSafety Commissioner, where services have failed to remove abusive content. The scheme applies to the full range of online services used by Australians. The eSafety Commissioner will have the power to issue take-down notices directly to the services, and also to end-users responsible for the abusive content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This new scheme does not override or supplant existing criminal provisions for abuse and harassment. Victims will still be able to go to the police. The eSafety Commissioner will work closely with law enforcement and hand over any evidence for criminal prosecutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will expand our cyber-bullying scheme for children. The eSafety Commissioner will now have the power to order the removal of material from the full range of online services where children are now spending time - such as games, websites, messaging and hosting services - and not just social media platforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sharing of intimate images without consent is a terrible thing to do and causes great distress to victims. The Government moved quickly to deal with this behaviour through legislation in 2018. We recognise that overwhelmingly victims simply want these images removed from the internet as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill reduces the timeframe within which intimate images must be removed following a notice from the eSafety Commissioner. The Commissioner will retain the ability to issue notices to social media services, relevant electronic services, designated internet services and hosting services. The Commissioner will also retain the ability to issue notices to end-users - those responsible for uploading intimate images - and will have access to infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions. Civil penalties of up to $111,000 will continue to apply to individuals who post or threaten to post images, or who fail to comply with a removal notice issued by the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To have a safer online environment, we need to change the law. But that in itself is not enough. The digital sector must also step up. So this Bill introduces a clear statement of what the Australian Government - on behalf of all Australians - expects of business in the digital sector. We call this statement the 'Basic Online Safety Expectations'. They will apply to service providers, including social media services; relevant electronic services such as messaging apps and games; and designated internet services such as websites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill allows the Minister to determine the detail of these expectations by legislative instrument. The Minister may also determine that the expectations apply to specific services. Here are some of the things we expect. We expect that service providers will take reasonable steps to ensure that Australians are able to use their services in a safe manner; we expect that services are not able to be used to bully, abuse or humiliate Australians.; and we expect that service providers will provide clear and readily identifiable mechanisms for users to report and lodge complaints about unacceptable use. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides for the Commissioner to publish statements about the performance of digital platforms in meeting the Government's expectations. The intent is to drive an improvement in the online safety practices of digital platforms. Where they fall short, the statements will provide advice to the public to inform their use of these services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes the digital industry must step up and do more to keep their users safe. That belief underpins the provisions of the Bill. The Bill will require new and updated industry codes to be developed. The Bill includes examples of the matters that the Government intends these new industry codes to address. These include preventing children from setting up online accounts without the consent of an adult; ensuring that customers have access to a filtered internet service should they choose to take it up; and providing information about online safety and procedures for dealing with prohibited and illegal online content. We expect that each section of the online industry will produce updated and strengthened industry codes within six months of commencement of this Bill. The Bill empowers the eSafety Commissioner to impose industry standards for those parts of the industry where this may be the best approach to improve online safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians continue to be concerned with the ease with which age-inappropriate or harmful content, such as pornography or violent material, can be accessed online. Online content is regulated in Australia through our Online Content Scheme. The scheme has successfully applied a complaints-based mechanism, managed by the eSafety Commissioner, with supporting industry codes to prevent prohibited online content from being hosted in Australia. The new legislation will retain all these elements. Because it is working effectively, changes to the Online Content Scheme in the new legislation are minimal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also empowers the eSafety Commissioner to act quickly in response to the 'worst of the worst' types of online content. The Bill reforms the Online Content Scheme so that class one material, or material which is so abhorrent that it would be refused classification, will no longer need to be reviewed and classified by the Classification Board before the eSafety Commissioner can order its removal. This includes child sexual exploitation material. In addition, the Bill provides the eSafety Commissioner with the power to issue take-down notices to providers of particularly egregious illegal content such as child sexual exploitation material which is hosted outside of Australia, and which can be accessed by end-users in Australia. The Bill provides for civil penalties where services fail to remove this content within 24 hours of the receipt of such a notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This strengthened power for the eSafety Commissioner will complement existing international work underway through the WePROTECT Global Alliance which is targeting and removing child sexual exploitation material no matter where it is hosted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also provides the eSafety Commissioner with the capability to prevent search engines from being the conduit to illegal online content. In the event that a search engine can be used by Australian end-users to access class one material, the Bill empowers the Commissioner to issue a link deletion notice. The notice requests that the search engine cease providing a link to the material within 24 hours, and inform the eSafety Commissioner when this has occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Bill allows the eSafety Commissioner to issue app removal notices that will request that online app stores remove apps that facilitate the posting of class one material. Once again, the notices will request that app stores remove these within 24 hours, and to inform the eSafety Commissioner when this has been completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The shocking live-streamed terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2019 warranted a comprehensive response from government and industry. In the days following the attacks, the Prime Minister established the Australian taskforce to combat terrorist and extreme violent material online. This taskforce - made up of digital platforms, internet service providers and government representatives, delivered a consensus report with recommendations to deny terrorists the ability to spread their propaganda and to incite further violence and acts of hate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill delivers on one of the taskforce's a key recommendations. It provides the eSafety Commissioner with a rapid website blocking power that may be used during an online crisis event. The Commissioner would need to consider the nature and likely reach of the material depicting, promoting, inciting or instructing in abhorrent violent conduct, and be satisfied that it would likely cause significant harm to the Australian community and that an urgent response is required. The notice power will only be used in these specific circumstances, to limit the exposure of Australians to terrorist or abhorrent violent material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government anticipates that a protocol already in place between the eSafety Commissioner and internet service providers will be updated to guide a swift response from industry in response to a blocking notice issued by the eSafety Commissioner. The Government appreciates the support of internet service providers in this effort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For too long, malicious actors have used anonymous online accounts to abuse, bully, or humiliate others. All too frequently, this anonymous abuse is directed at women, victims of family violence or minority groups. Anonymous accounts are also used to exchange the 'worst of the worst' images and content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill clarifies and strengthens the information gathering and investigative powers of the eSafety Commissioner to unmask the identities behind these anonymous accounts. The Bill allows the eSafety Commissioner to require that social media services, relevant electronic services and designated internet services provide identity and contact information about end-users in relation to cyber-bullying, cyber-abuse, image-based abuse or prohibited online content. Civil penalties will apply to services who fail to comply with a written notice from the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We all enjoy standards of behaviour and civility in the town square that keep us safe, and there are appropriate mechanisms and sanctions for those who break these rules. The Australian Government believes that the digital town square should also be a safe place, and that there should be consequences for those who use the internet to cause others harm. This Bill contains a comprehensive set of measures designed in accordance with this belief. I commend the Bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill operates in conjunction with the Online Safety Bill 2021, which I have just introduced. Together, these Bills will strengthen and extend Australia's world-leading online safety framework by adopting and building on the effective elements of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015</span> and Schedules 5 and 7 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</span>. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill repeals the <span style="font-style:italic;">Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015</span> upon commencement of the new Online Safety Act<span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>The Online Safety Bill will become the new enabling legislation for Australia's eSafety Commissioner, and will strengthen and extend the Commissioner's powers to keep Australians safe online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will repeal Schedule 5 and some sections of Schedule 7 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</span> which is the enabling legislation for regulation of online content, known as the Online Content Scheme. These functions will be transitioned to the new Online Safety Act. This will create a single Act containing comprehensive measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will give effect to the Government's election commitment, made in the lead up to the 2019 election, to strengthen maximum penalties for use of a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. Accordingly, the Bill increases the maximum penalty under section 474.17 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995 </span>from three years' imprisonment to five years' imprisonment.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also makes changes to section 474.17A and 474.17B of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span> to ensure that offenders who show a pattern of causing online harm through dissemination of private sexual material continue to be given a higher penalty than first time offenders. These changes reflect the Australian public's expectation that the punishment for this type of conduct should be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes general amendments consequential to the enactment of the Online Safety Act.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout the Coronavirus Pandemic the Government has acted decisively to cushion the blow for households and businesses.  We have provided $251 billion in direct support to households and businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The pandemic caused a once in a lifetime disruption to the labour market and we used our comprehensive welfare system to provide emergency support to Australians impacted by the crisis, including through the Coronavirus Supplement and expanded access to JobSeeker Payment and related payments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout this period, our values have not changed. The Government strongly believes that the key to improving people's living standards and reducing welfare dependency is job creation and having the right incentives to ensure there is a workforce ready to take those jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to our JobMaker plan to support businesses and provide the employment opportunities Australian need, we are strengthening our income support system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government thanks the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on this Bill on 12 March 2021 and its recommendation that this Bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens commented on the proposed $50 per fortnight increase to working age income support payments.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government rejects Labor's assertion that the Bill does not do enough in relation to income free areas and to support Australians facing poverty and hardship.  Australia has a very strong safety net in our social security system.  Income support payments are not intended to be an income replacement.  In addition to the base payments, recipients have access to other supplementary payments and concessions, depending on their individual circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government rejects the Greens' recommendations that all income support payments should be paid at a rate of $1115 a fortnight and the income free threshold permanently increased to $300 a fortnight.  This would return the JobSeeker payment to around the level it was at through most of 2020; it was always intended as a temporary support measure to help people through the additional hardship posed by the economic conditions of the pandemic.  Jobs have been returning, and temporary arrangements are no longer required. Increasing payments to this level would have a significant impact on the budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to Labor's and the Greens' comments to the Committee calling on the Government to abandon its plans to increase mutual obligation requirements or to introduce a social security hotline for employers,  I note these are not matters that are included in this Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will provide a permanent increase to working age payments provided to over 1.95 million Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This $50 increase is the largest increase to unemployment payments in more than 35 years, and will be provided to jobseekers, student payment recipients, parenting payment recipients, and youth payment recipients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This $9 billion increase to payments balances the need to ensure income support payments encourage and enable workforce participation with the need for the welfare system to be fiscally sustainable for future generations. This rate increase will occur from 1 April 2021, and is in addition to the usual indexation of payments taking effect on 20 March 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The $50 per fortnight increase will apply to JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment, Austudy, Special Benefit, Partner Allowance and Widow Allowance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This increase will flow on to ABSTUDY (Living Allowance), Farm Household Allowance and payments made under the Department of Veterans' Affairs Education Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also permanently increases the income free area to $150 per fortnight for JobSeeker Payment and Youth Allowance (other) from 1 April 2021, allowing people to keep more of what they earn as they reconnect with the labour market and encourage recipients to take the first step into employment without impacting their payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill extends the waiver of the Ordinary Waiting Period for Parenting Payment, JobSeeker Payment and Youth Allowance, for a further three months until 30 June 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also extends to 30 June 2021, expanded access to JobSeeker Payment and Youth Allowance (other) for persons who find themselves having to self-isolate or care for someone who is self-isolating due to the pandemic.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It also extends the portability period for certain Age Pensioners and recipients of the Disability Support Pension (for severely disabled persons) until 30 June 2021.  This means pensioners unable to return to, or depart from, Australia within 26 weeks due to travel restrictions resulting from COVID-19 will have their entitlement maintained until 30 June 2021, as if they had been able to return home as planned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The policy delivered by this Bill carries a cost of approximately $9 billion to 2024-25, including approximately $700 million in 2020-21.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  As I was saying before we ran into a hard marker earlier today, when I was just getting warmed up, it's no surprise at all to see, under the cover of a pandemic, that the ideologically driven neoliberals have come in here to do the bidding of their corporate masters, and of course the people who are going to wear the pain for this are Australian workers. Before I go to the detail of the bill, let's have a look at where four or five decades of turbocharged neoliberalism has brought us to today. We are cooking the planet. The climate is breaking down around us. We are in the sixth mass extinction event in the history of the Earth. An entire generation of young Australians are being priced out of the great Australian dream of owning their own home. Millions of Australians are unemployed, underemployed or in insecure work, with women, young people and migrant workers bearing the brunt. And instead of working to increase job security, to create more jobs, to lift wages—which is what the government should be doing—they are pushing through a bill that will further entrench insecure work, will suppress wages, will give more power to businesses at the expense of workers and will undermine the role of unions. The neoliberals have an awful lot to answer for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic has highlighted the inequality that's been allowed to flourish as a result of neoliberalism and as a result of insecure work in Australia. Casual workers were hit hardest during the pandemic, accounting for about two-thirds of the people who lost their jobs in early 2020. Those casuals who still had a job were amongst the lowest-paid and most-insecure workers, with no access to paid leave entitlements. And we can't forget the role that insecure and casual workers played in spreading COVID-19 across the country, as workers without paid sick leave were forced to choose between their health and their income. Many employers have built insecure work into their business models. While they turn a profit, workers have had no work or income security. The changes in this bill will further entrench insecure work in Australia. They will exacerbate wealth inequality in our country and in our industrial relations system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quote from Alison Pennington, from the Centre for Future Work, regarding the bill. She says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Casual work has dominated employment growth in our post-COVID recovery. Between May and November, 62 per cent of all jobs created were casual. That's 400,000 jobs in six months, or 2,200 every day. It's the fastest growth in casual work in our history. What that shows is, first of all, that claims that there is a lack of confidence among employers to engage in hiring casual work is not credible. It also shows that the pandemic is intensifying and entrenching the use of insecure and casual work in the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of passing a bill that will entrench insecure work, reduce wages and increase the power of employers, we need to outlaw insecure work and ensure the right of all workers to a safe, meaningful, well-paid and secure job with good conditions. Those are the things that we should be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make the point that during the pandemic Australia's billionaires did very, very well indeed, increasing their wealth on average by over 20 per cent in the year that we've been living in a global pandemic, increasing their wealth on average by over 20 per cent when hundreds of thousands of Australian workers lost their jobs, increasing their wealth on average by over 20 per cent while most of the rest of the country had to tighten our belts and do it tough. It's about time that billionaires were forced to make a bigger contribution to government funds so that we can fund the public services, the extent of public services and the quality of public services that Australian people expect from their government. We should be making the billionaires and the big corporations pay their fair share of tax so that we can provide more Australians with a dignified life and with safe and secure work and lift people out of poverty. That's what we should be doing, not bringing legislation like this one into the house.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition of 'casual' in this bill will give employers all the power to determine whether a worker is casual and will allow businesses to classify workers as casual at the start of their employment regardless of the number of hours they actually end up working. The bill clarifies that, to avoid any doubt, the question of whether a person is a casual employee is to be assessed on the basis of the offer of employment and the acceptance of that offer, not on the basis of any subsequent conduct of either party. There it is, colleagues: it's in black and white. Not only does this new definition do nothing to prevent the continued abuse of casual workers; it actually facilitates it by allowing businesses to hire workers as casual and give them full-time hours without requiring them to pay entitlements or provide any job security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the great challenges facing our country today. But what do you get in this place when the agents of the big corporations and the super wealthy in the Liberal and National parties come into this place? They move legislation like this which will entrench insecure work, suppress wages and continue to ensure that millions of Australians live in poverty, in rental stress or in mortgage stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we should be doing is making sure—and we do have the capacity to do this—that we put in place public policies that lift wages and that reduce and ultimately eliminate the number of Australians in casual and insecure work. We are a rich enough country to make sure that every Australian who wants a decent job can have a decent, safe and dignified job. These are not pipe dreams. These are not pie-in-the-sky philosophies. We are a wealthy enough country to generate full employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of times I hear the Liberal and National parties come into this place and talk about jobs—well, I've got to say, on their own test they are abject and epic failures. They come in here every day and talk about the importance of jobs. I've been in politics for nearly 20 years, and I've never seen the unemployment rate significantly under five per cent. We know there are large numbers of Australians who simply don't participate in the labour market because they've given up all hope of ever landing a job. We should be aiming unabashedly for full employment, where every Australian who wants to work has a job. Yet we get these hypocrites in here. They come in here every day, thump the tub and talk about jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the government: you've failed your own test. And why have you done that? Because you've deliberately chosen to put in place policies where the number of people who are looking for work far exceeds the number of jobs available, and you've done that in order to drive down wages. It's a simple supply-and-demand equation, and you've done it deliberately. Yet you come in here and you hypocritically bang on about how important jobs are and how jobs are your No. 1 focus. I tell you what: if jobs are your No. 1 focus, I'd hate to see what your No. 5, No. 10 or No. 20 focus issues are, because you've abjectly failed at what you describe as your No. 1 focus—that is, generating jobs in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will create a new class of de facto casual workers by robbing part-time workers of hours and income security by allowing businesses to effectively treat them like casuals, with the power to increase and decrease workers' hours. The bill introduces simplified additional-hours agreements, which allow part-time workers in industries that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail, to be employed on contracts that offer a guarantee of only 16 hours a week, with their employer able to increase their hours without paying overtime. This applies to 12 modern awards. However, the minister will have the power to make regulations to include or exclude modern awards. Workers will be forced into a false choice: to accept a contract with minimal guaranteed hours and agree to additional hours at lower pay or risk losing the job offer or additional hours to one of the over two million people who are currently unemployed or underemployed. This push from government turns what should be secure, well-paid jobs into insecure work with no guarantee of regular hours or take-home pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're cooking the planet, while the climate is breaking down around us, while a million species are on the road to extinction in the sixth mass extinction event in the history of our planet, while there is a war on nature, while an entire generation of young Australians is being priced out of the housing market because this government allows the RBA to print hundreds of millions of dollars at a time and bung it into the banks—who, instead of lending it to productive businesses, lend it to housing speculators—while we have millions of Australians in insecure work who are underemployed, many of whom are unemployed, and while all these absolutely solvable social and environmental issues exist, what do the government do? They come in here to do the bidding of their corporate masters. And why do they do that? Because they benefit from the institutionalised bribery of dirty political donations. They know that when their time is up in this place many of them will roll out the revolving door and into cushy, well-paid jobs as CEOs, senior managers and board members of those very same corporations. It is nothing other than blatant corruption; that's what it is. What we're seeing here today is yet another example of the old adage, 'If you want to know what's going on, follow the money,' and of the other adage, 'If you scratch most things in politics, the first thing you will expose is self-interest.'</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021 on behalf of the many hardworking Tasmanians who are worried about the impact this legislation will have on them and their rights at work. I also wish to highlight the impact this legislation will have on the heroes in our fight against COVID-19: the aged-care and disability-care workers and other frontline health workers. This bill, which has been amply addressed through some of the contributions to this debate, does absolutely nothing to address issues around job security and exploitation—in fact, it does quite the opposite. This bill does nothing to address wage insecurity. This bill seems to assume that employers are not already casualising permanent work. This bill assumes that employers need even more flexibility with rosters. It says nothing about the certainty and security our key health and social services workers need and deserve. And all this is being done by this government, who, every time they have an opportunity, attack workers' rights, entitlements and security. They've done it before. They do it every time they get the opportunity. This time it's even worse, because they're doing it under the guise of a recovery from COVID-19. Under the guise of a recovery from COVID-19, this government is looking to increase casualisation, enable more job insecurity and cut take-home pay. That is what this bill that we are debating here today will do. If it is passed into law, it will make wages less secure, jobs less secure and take-home pay less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Health Services Union said at the Senate inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When health and care workers don't have secure work, our most vulnerable community members miss out—people with a disability, older Australians and those with mental illness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that is the case. It's the case now, and this bill seeks to make that position worse, exacerbate that position. What will happen is that those most vulnerable in the community will again miss out. We need look no further than the devastating evidence given to the aged-care royal commission to understand the impact that current employment practices are having on older Australians. Aged-care workers are already ending shifts in tears because they are short-staffed and overworked and haven't been able to provide the care that aged-care residents need. What is the government's answer to this? This is after the aged-care royal commission and all the evidence that has been taken and completely ignored by this government. What's the answer? To introduce legislation that will give employers even more flexibility, that will deliver increased job and wage insecurity. Our most vulnerable Australians and the hardworking Australians who care for them deserve so much better than this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that, currently, 40 per cent of workers are in insecure work, while more than one million of our fellow Australians are underemployed and want more work. Surely the cornerstone of any workplace relations legislation should be that workers are entitled to a fair opportunity to provide for themselves and their families. How does this bill do that? The short answer is: it doesn't. Instead, if this bill is passed, the number of people trapped in insecure work will increase. This bill further erodes the rights of casual workers and will broaden the use of casual workers throughout our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has come along after years of advocates and employment spokespeople talking about the casualisation of the workforce. The casualisation of the workforce is even greater, and insecurity in work is growing. It's really quite unbelievable that those on that side think this is an opportunity for them to erode those rights even more and to make casual work even greater in Australia. I'm sure that they would know how difficult it is to care for your family when you're a casual worker, how you're not able to rely on a regular pay cheque, how you're not able to access loans and how difficult it is to secure rental housing. This is the reality. This is what people are dealing with. And your answer is to make it even harder for them. I'm not really sure that you've talked to casuals and long-term casual workers who work the same hours as a permanent part-time position or even, indeed, a full-time position. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People take these jobs and accept those conditions because they need to take care of themselves and their families and to pay their bills. Let's not think that it is easy for these people. They do have issues around being able to secure rental housing and loans. This bill further erodes the rights of those casual workers and will broaden the use of casual workers throughout our economy. Casual and insecure workers experience unpredictable and fluctuating pay, limited or no access to paid leave, and insecurity over the length of their employment. It's at the whim of their employer. Wage increases are irrelevant for insecure workers if they don't have a shift the next day, week or month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Creating and protecting secure jobs and decent working conditions should and must be our collective top priority. I don't understand why it isn't for this government—or maybe I actually do. Every time the government have had an opportunity to cut workers' entitlements, to cut workers' conditions and to cut workers' pay, they've taken it. Work Choices was the opportunity that they took. That was wholesale destruction of the industrial relations system at the time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing now is the government taking this opportunity under the cover of the COVID-19 recovery; they seem to think this situation should be borne by those least able to afford it. Seriously, get out there and talk to casual workers and talk to employers, because there are plenty of employers that are doing the right thing. What the government is doing is making it harder for these employees and harder for those employers that want to do the right thing by their employees. That's what you're doing right here, right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of protecting secure jobs and decent working conditions, this bill is about the growth of casualisation, particularly in industries like hospitality. It is now clear that insecure work is not a stepping stone to permanent employment. Work practices like labour hire, sham contracting, casualisation, gig platforms and more have all thrived under this government and will now become entrenched if this bill is passed. I really hope that that is not the case, but I fear it will happen. It will be the casual workers and their families who will bear the brunt of this legislation. Just look at sham contracting: it's used by employers to disguise employment relationships as independent contracting arrangements. This is usually done so the employer can avoid responsibility for employee entitlements. These contracts are rife in the horticultural, security and cleaning sectors and in the trades. Sham contracting shifts all the additional employment costs, like insurance, onto the worker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During COVID, Australians got to learn about the employment arrangements and conditions of private security guards. Many of the employees in this sector are overseas students. They were particularly vulnerable during the pandemic as they were excluded from the government's JobKeeper and JobSeeker arrangements—another hard-hearted action by this government. The private security sector has seen increased profitability and growing rates of employment, but that employment comes at a cost. It is a sector littered with extremely poor job and income security. Employees pay up to $1,700 to qualify as a security guard and then earn as little as $13 to $15 per hour. Little wonder they take as many shifts as they can and work across more than one location and for more than one company. I don't think anybody here would like having to bring up a family on that sort of money, or even to keep body and soul together on that sort of money. There's no superannuation, no long-service leave, no sick leave, no overtime loading, no penalty rates for working on weekends or public holidays; it's just a flat rate of $15 an hour. These workers were at the forefront of keeping our communities safe by restricting the spread of COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of insecure work is the issue of power. Employers know that insecure workers have limited power to speak up and assert their rights. Without job security, workers cannot speak up without risking their job. The legislation before us today makes bargaining for better wages and conditions harder. Make no mistake; that's an actual fact. There won't be any bargaining. The legislation will allow cuts to wages. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it brutally clear that the paid work of women in sectors such as aged care and disability services is fundamental to our economic and social survival. Over 90 per cent of aged-care sector workers are female, and they will bear the brunt of this piece of legislation. That's what's going to happen. It's written to affect this group. The government knows that that is what's going to happen if this legislation is passed into law. This bill marks a return to the us-versus-them mentality that was at the heart of Work Choices. If passed, it will further entrench low wages growth. It represents a return to the let-the-market-rip approach to workplace relations that lies deep in the heart of the Liberal Party. For these reasons and for many more, this bill should be and needs to be rejected.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I rise to speak in debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021. I cannot support this bill in the form in which it has been presented. I do note that in the last probably three or four minutes One Nation have circulated a number of amendments. What I would say is, even though I'm always open-minded about amendments and will have a look at things, there is no time to look at them properly. That's the tragedy of the way in which the government has managed this legislation. They'd only really secured two crossbench votes this afternoon to the point where amendments had been circulated, giving no-one any time to consider what those amendments do. I know many people have spoken before me on some of the defects in the current bill, and I'm not going to repeat what those defects are because they've been covered quite significantly by other speakers. What I do want to talk about is alternatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to start by talking about the Governor-General's speech on the first day of the 46th Parliament. I'm going to be careful not to breach standing orders, so I'll have to say that the Governor-General's speech is, in fact, the Prime Minister's speech and so I'm not being critical of the Governor-General when I criticise what was said. I will say that that speech was quite uninspiring. It was about carving up the current economic pie, rather than growing it. There could have been a Labor election win and I might have heard the same sorts of things: talk about education, talk about social housing, talk about Defence—a whole range of different portfolio conversations, but none of them inspirational. I found it quite troubling that there was no vision in that particular speech. Then we got hit by a pandemic. We saw threat to life, we saw threat to basic supplies, we saw loss of jobs. But we all came together to get through COVID. Now we're almost out and on the other side of the pandemic, although I won't say we're completely out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're almost out and just starting to come back from some of the most dramatic health, economic and social events of recent times, caused by a global pandemic with massive consequences, disruption and dislocation, and what does the coalition do? What's the first item on their agenda? They immediately reach into their bottom drawer, or maybe it's the drawer of the Business Council of Australia, and pull out—surprise, surprise—an industrial relations package, a so-called reform package that would, if enacted in full as originally proposed, be to the very considerable disadvantage of many workers and their families. Instead of learning from COVID, instead of growing the pie, instead of building in resilience, they went back to the traditional battlegrounds that they typically have with the Labor Party. I guess it's a case of 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks' or perhaps, in the case of the Liberal Party, 'old dogs only know one trick'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at the big picture of what is happening in Australia at the moment, I can see that companies are faring pretty well. Certainly, if the ASX200 index is anything to go by, some of that wellness has been fuelled by taxpayer funded JobKeeper allowances or subsidies that have been used contrary to their legitimate intent. We've seen some businesses behaving quite poorly throughout all of this. On the other side of the ledger, we have seen stagnant wage growth. The wage growth index has been plummeting over the last decade, and that has to be of concern. Now, I'm not a person who says we don't let businesses profit. I actually am a strong believer in those taking a lead in business and taking a risk doing well from that; good on them. But there needs to be some sharing of wealth and prosperity; that's the way it has to be. That does not appear to be happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can listen to people talk about trickle-down economics over and over again, but then I look at the data and it's not working. So I think to myself, 'Where are the policies that talk about how we assist business to grow?' Rather than trying to take the current pie that we have and carve it up in a different way, how do we make this pie bigger? How do we make it tastier? That's missing. There are a number of things we could do. Government procurement is an example. We could give some emphasis to Australian businesses in government procurement. I remember that one of the first things we did as we were dealing with COVID was to give our COVIDSafe application to a foreign entity. Rather than injecting that money into a local capability that would help retain jobs, we put ourselves in a situation where we gave it to an overseas entity. Indeed, that created some problems because of the US CLOUD Act. But when you do that, when you don't support Australian industry, not only do you give the foreign entity money, which they then reinvest in their own company to be better able to compete against Australian companies; you end up giving a double negative whammy to Australian companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think about the way in which we do procurement. Clause 4.7 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules allows government officials to take account of the economic benefit of contracting with a particular party. That doesn't mean it has to be an Australian party, but you look at the party and you say, 'How many jobs are they creating? What capital investment are they making? What's the supply chain effect of the procurement?' We can use that to inject government money back into our own economy, stimulating jobs, helping with the wealth that we want to see here in Australia and doing other things like helping in relation to national resilience—something that, as a result of the pandemic, we have learnt we need to have regard of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the government says we can't do this. There's a whole bunch of people who are fanatics in relation to free trade and they say, 'Well, we've got to have free trade,' and I get that we're a trading nation. I'm not discouraging us from being a trade nation, but when we procure things we can't look at a foreign entity and try to compare them with the Australian entity, because the Australian entity may have to pay minimum wages, they may have to pay a leave loading, they may have to pay long service leave, they may have to comply with occupational health and safety requirements and they may have to comply with environmental requirements. All of those are good things, but they drive up the cost of the business. The government basically mandates those things, but then doesn't recognise it when it compares a product that comes from another jurisdiction where they don't have all of those things that make our society what it is today. So the government needs to stop pretending that there is a level playing field or that it likes to have a level playing field in procurement, because it simply doesn't. There is no level playing field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are the plans to support value-adding? We need to stop just exporting our rocks. We need to stop just exporting lithium and, rather, export batteries. Where's the government's plan on doing that? Where's the legislation that has been brought forward that allows and permits us to do that sort of activity? Don't just export iron ore; export steel. Value-add. Grow the jobs. Develop intellectual property. That's what happens when you do that value-adding. Again, the government doesn't want to do it, because they think they're going to skew the market. Well, let's look at what's happening in Whyalla at the moment. Because we're not backing Australian companies, Australian industry, we've got the situation where Whyalla may well face a company going into administration. I don't blame the government for that, but having the policies that enable us to stand up and support our industries is extremely important. Again, it's growing the pie, not carving up the existing pie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to infrastructure policies: we had a $10 billion boost in infrastructure programs, but what most people don't understand is that the government places requirements on infrastructure contractors that mean only tier 1s can get the big jobs. Here's the sad news: there are no Australian tier 1s. We actually have a policy, implemented by this government, that mandates the use of foreign companies. Those foreign companies, of course, subcontract here in Australia because the work has to be done here, but they squeeze the supply chain. They squeeze the profit out and it goes back to the head company. They get rid of it overseas, by way of transfer pricing, licensing—a whole range of different accounting tricks—to low-tax jurisdictions. Why aren't we fixing that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, while I'm on tax, we know there are so many companies that are paying no tax at all, not contributing. It's money that could come into consolidated revenue and be employed to assist small businesses, doing much more than this legislation would do, but it's all missing. As some senators will be aware, together with Senator Lambie I have circulated amendments to the bill which effectively block almost everything in the bill, except for the wage theft and enforcement provisions. Those would remedy situations where we have wage theft, and we do have to deal with that wage theft. Will my amendments be acceptable to government? I don't know. I don't think so. Unfortunately, the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations is still on leave, so we probably won't have any authoritative response from him in respect of whether or not the amendments are palatable. Again, I don't think they will be, because they really do gut the bill. But it's the only way that I can see that the bill can be supported at this point in time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that One Nation are on board. We've now had Senator Roberts circulate amendments, so one presumes that they are on board. Again, they're very late and it's almost impossible to do the analysis to work out whether or not you can support them. We also don't know how those amendments might interact with the other player who's left, Centre Alliance's Senator Griff. I won't speak for Senator Lambie but, noting that she has co-sponsored my amendments, we're in a situation where ultimately this will come down to Senator Griff—informed, of course, by his colleague in the other place, Ms Rebekha Sharkie. They have all the cards. The government have time pressure here because they want to deal with this between now and tomorrow, so Centre Alliance are in the box seat. They'd better use that position well. They'd better use it to get some really good amendments that strike the right balance between business and workers, because right now the bill doesn't do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we don't actually know what Senator Griff is doing and what Ms Sharkie's views are because Senator Griff is not on the speakers list. That, to me, is in some sense disrespectful. He has the casting vote on this but is not prepared to come into the chamber and explain to the people of South Australia, whom he represents, exactly what his position is. In all of the bills I get involved in where there's controversy and I might have a casting vote or a significant say in what happens, I stand in this chamber and tell people what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. I think that needs to happen. In closing, my message to Senator Griff is: come into the chamber and explain yourself. You clearly feel a particular way about this bill, but you need to stand up in the second reading debate and explain to the people of South Australia what your position is and why.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  For most of my working life, I've worked in the trade union movement, and I've proudly worked for United Workers Union. It went through a number of amalgamations in all the time that I worked there. But there are some things that have never changed. It is the union which represents some of the lowest-paid workers in this country—cleaners, security officers, aged-care workers, childcare workers, hospitality workers and so on. These are people who don't have the luxury of flexible working hours. These are people who were the heroes of our pandemic. These are the aged-care workers who were in this place yesterday begging those few on the other side who actually met with them to do something about the royal commission into aged care, to start to really lift the lives of people who find themselves in aged care. These are workers who earn around $22 or $23 an hour. They work part time. But, these days, they work in insecure work. Most of them are at the beck and call of their current employer. Most of them have to work two and three jobs to survive. And that's the story of my working life as a proud trade union official at United Workers Union. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as a trade union official, I've seen these sorts of bills be presented by conservative governments over and over and over again. I have never seen a conservative government put forward an industrial relations bill which benefits workers in this country—never. And I would challenge those opposite to stand up and prove me wrong, because that has been my life's work. I worked for United Workers Union for more than 20 years. I'm very proud to be in the Senate. But to suggest somehow that, in 2013, when I left United Voice, as it was called then, I forgot about those workers, that I left those workers behind—that I forgot about the 20 years that I worked alongside, acted on behalf of and advocated for these workers and stood in picket lines in the rain and the heat with them—you are sadly mistaken. They are in my veins and they're in my heart, and I will defend the rights of workers until I take my last breath, because that is ultimately who I am. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Court Liberal government days in Western Australia, I saw the first wave, the second wave, the third wave of industrial relations reform. I saw a Liberal government reduce the wages of low-paid women—low-paid cleaners, low-paid early childhood educators, low-paid aged-care workers. I watched as their award rates tumbled down. And what happened to that Court government? Workers will only take so much. They rose up and voted that government out of office. As bad as the Barnett government was when it came into power in Western Australia, it didn't go near workers, because it had learnt its lesson—that, when you start to reduce the take-home pay of low-paid workers, you will wear the consequences of that at the ballot box. Of course, while I was standing alongside workers at the rallies and in workplaces and everywhere else, we were also fighting under Mr Howard's regimes, under his individual workplace agreements. And, gee, I wish someone would get those old ads out and play them. Remember those ads? Workers were going to be better off. Workers were going to be able to directly negotiate with their boss. Who could forget the individual contracts? What did we see? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again the casualties of those individual contracts, the workers with the least power in this country, were the low-paid workers; women workers; insecure workers. We saw them, once again, suffer the indignity of losing more money. This time it was their penalty rates. Suddenly, their penalty rates were gone because they had to sign an individual contract.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember Mr Howard and Mr Reith saying over and over again, 'No-one will be forced to sign these contracts.' What a load of rubbish! We all know how it works in the workplace when the boss has got all the power. You get called in and you get told, 'Sue, if you want a shift next week, here's your new agreement.' It's a one-on-one conversation. And of course there was no recourse to the Industrial Relations Commission for any worker who signed an individual contract, no recourse at all. And they were secret agreements, so if you were a 16-year-old worker, guess what? You couldn't even take that home and show it to mum and dad. That was outrageous legislation. And, whilst Mr Howard might have tinkered at the edges, it eventually cost him his seat and it eventually cost the Howard coalition government in Australia. As we saw in Victoria at the time, when similar legislation was put into place there to what we saw in Western Australia, those Liberals were voted out of office. In Western Australia, those Liberals were voted out of office. Federally, Mr Howard, the first sitting Prime Minister since Stanley Bruce to lose his seat, was voted out of office. Make no mistake: you will be voted out of office for this legislation because, despite what you say, this legislation will cut workers' wages at a time in this country when we have industrial relations legislation—yes, it absolutely needs to be reformed. You stood over there, and Mr Porter stood in the other place and said, 'We accept workers need more protection.' Well, this legislation doesn't deliver it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the working lives of low-paid workers are much worse since I left the union in 2013. We've got the gig economy. We've got the Uber drivers. We've got all of those workers who deliver meals or who you can get to fix your tap by using an app and negotiating how much you pay them. It's disgraceful. These are human beings trying to earn a living. They should be entitled to some basic protections. They should be entitled to an hourly rate that gives them the ability to live a good and decent life. They should know, from week to week, how many hours of work they have. They should not receive a text from their boss telling them, 'Come in tomorrow,' or 'Don't come in tomorrow.' And that doesn't just happen in the gig economy. That happens to workers in the disability sector looking after some of the most vulnerable people in our community. That's how they get their work, via their mobile phone. 'Oh, there's a two-hour shift available for you tomorrow.' That is not a dignified existence. It's not a dignified existence for the person who's subjected to that kind of summonsing to work, and, in my view, it's certainly not the dignified way for the person with a disability to receive the care that they are absolutely entitled to, but that's what we're seeing in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right across Australia—even in the public service—we have casualised, contracted, insecure work. It used to just be the domain of members of the United Workers Union and the SDA—shop assistants and so on—who were seen as low paid, not very well trained and poorly educated, so therefore you could treat them with disrespect. Well, they are some of the most honourable people I've ever had the privilege to meet in my life, and many of them are friends of mine. Jude Clarke was here yesterday. She's an aged-care worker that I signed up to the union a long time ago—too long ago to remember! Jude and I have been through a lot together. The first industrial action that Jude took was when she was working in a nursing home in Geraldton. If you met or saw Jude yesterday, she was the aged-care worker with the pink hair; that's Jude. Why did she go on strike? Not for pay. Not for conditions. Not because some bully union official like me told her to. She went on strike because the residents in that nursing home—I still remember it as if it was yesterday, but it was a long time ago—had disgraceful beds.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  State governments in Australia are giving experimental, life-altering medical treatments to children and refusing to produce data demonstrating the extent of these practices, details about the cohort of children who are affected or any evidence about the long-term outcomes of these practices. In any other field of medicine, that would cause a major scandal and prompt immediate investigations. But when it comes to the treatment of children with gender dysphoria, some as young as five years of age, states apparently feel empowered to operate in secrecy and to actively avoid any public disclosure or external expert oversight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June last year, the Health Chief Executives Forum, a body consisting of each Australian jurisdiction's top health bureaucrats, commenced an audit and review of the care and treatment of children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria. The context in which this audit and review was to occur was that, according to data sourced under FOI, the number of Australian children and teenagers presenting to gender clinics and being treated with puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones has skyrocketed in recent years. This is consistent with international trends in which teenage girls in particular are driving massive increases in children seeking medical alterations to their bodies. Many experts have observed that children with childhood trauma, girls with autism spectrum disorder and same-sex-attracted teenagers make up a significant portion of young people seeking to transition medically to a different gender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December last year, after being contacted by doctors and psychiatrists concerned at the lack of data available on this trend in Australia, I wrote to the chair of the Health Chief Executives Forum, requesting public release of the data and responses provided by states and territories. I noted in my letter: 'The release of the data provided by states and territories would enable experts and practitioners to better understand this trend and study the underlying causes. It is evident that a significant amount of policy development in this area has occurred without public transparency, independent scientific oversight or adequate collection of data and evidence.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember what concerned psychiatrists are saying about the practices of gender clinics in the UK, where some level of transparency and scrutiny has actually been applied. US psychiatrist Professor Stephen Levine says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no other field of medicine where such radical interventions are offered to children with such a poor evidence base.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr David Bell, a recently retired senior psychiatrist at England's Tavistock youth gender clinic, says treatments are:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… not fit for purpose and children's needs are being met in a woeful inadequate manner, and some will live on with the damaging consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He says that children have been very seriously damaged. And England's health regulators in the High Court have publicly canned the Tavistock clinic both for failing to keep adequate data and for failing to produce evidence that supports their practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, with all that information available to them, how did Australia's state governments respond to my request to be transparent and release the data they had? The response I received from the chair of the forum explained: 'In June 2020 the Health Chief Executives Forum asked member jurisdictions to provide advice on this issue. Jurisdictions operating gender clinics were asked to provide information of referral pathways, the clinical services provided, what clinical guidelines are adhered to, what data is collected and whether any long-term monitoring is undertaken.' So far, so good. But, after outlining what information was sought from the states, the letter goes on to say: 'No information about the number or nature of patients was collected. After discussion, members agreed the Health Chief Executives Forum would not progress this work.' So they started a review and didn't collect any information whatsoever about how many children they are treating, what sex those children are, what other conditions or trauma—if any—the children are dealing with or what the long-term outcomes of their treatments are. Shouldn't alarm bells be going off everywhere when the nation's most senior health bureaucrats start an investigation into something, fail to collect any data and then abandon their investigation without any findings?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some cases, these are the same bureaucrats in charge of gender clinics which are apparently delivering an unknown number of experimental treatments to an unknown number of children with unknown results. And their response was that they decided the audit review wouldn't progress. How is it acceptable that, in this one area of medicine, silence and secrecy is seen as commendable, while transparency and investigation is frowned upon? If these state governments are confident in their practices, what have they got to hide?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250362" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  COVID-19 has exposed many structural inequities in Australia and internationally, from economic insecurity to wildly unequal access to health services. In 2021, the global vaccine rollout has come sharply into focus. Australia has the means to acquire and distribute a life-saving vaccine amongst our population. Make no mistake: this is a privilege. But what we are seeing on an international level is rich nations making strides towards full immunity while poorer nations are left behind. Australia is complicit in this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Greens are calling on the Australian government to support the temporary waiver currently being considered at the WTO which would waive intellectual property provisions of the TRIPS agreement with respect to COVID-19 vaccines, a waiver which has already received the support of over 100 countries. Between programs and direct talks with manufacturers, Australia has negotiated for over 125 million doses. This is more than enough to vaccinate our population. However, 130 other countries have not received even one single dose. If a country cannot access or afford some of the artificially scarce supply, they'll have no option but to watch their citizens suffer. By waiving intellectual property rights, vaccines will be manufactured and delivered where they are needed most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Prime Minister has said that it's a moral responsibility for a vaccine to be shared far and wide. I couldn't agree more. Access to health care is a human right. This vaccine is a public good. It is unconscionable to deny any country access to protect the profits of pharmaceutical giants. Australia has given $80 million to the COVAX program to help distribution in vulnerable countries. This is welcome, but it is also not enough. The COVAX program is struggling to meet its funding goal of $6.8 billion. It is also struggling to access vaccines among the global demand. Expecting this program to alleviate the burden faced by the global south is ridiculous. Even in the best-case scenario, millions of people are being left unvaccinated and at risk of becoming critically ill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have argued that the intellectual property provisions waiver would hamper scientific innovation by deterring private investment. This is frankly a ludicrous argument. There is no evidence to suggest that this waiver would drive away those looking to invest. And, even if it did, is a pandemic not a good enough time to value lives over profit? Or do we insist on protecting corporations over people? This argument is clearly a smokescreen to protect those who profit from such predatory capitalism. Our priority should not be pharmaceutical company profits; it should be increasing access to a life-saving treatment. This should not have to be said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a response to the waiver request, Australia signed and circulated a letter to the WTO encouraging 'discussions' with vaccine developers. This letter—co-signed with six other countries—sounds nice, but it does nothing. It's a pseudocompromise we've offered to placate countries that face a real and terrible threat. To reject this waiver is to condemn the global south to either face crushing debt to acquire vaccines or let their citizens die. If there is any good that should be affordable and widely distributed, it is a vaccine in the middle of a global pandemic. The countries that are facing the worst of this threat are already facing legacies of previous neo-colonial deals designed to drive them into debt. This way, we would help to give them autonomy, moving away from the dependence they have historically been subject to and their reliance on the whims of our aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This waiver would not increase our spending. It would not cost taxpayer money. Australia has the ability to help at minimal cost and an obligation to do so. Rather than propagating a cycle of reliance, this waiver will promote countries' independence as they're able to manufacture and distribute their own vaccine. I call on the Australian government to value people's lives over the profits of pharmaceutical companies by supporting the TRIPS waiver at the next meeting of the TRIPS Council, which could happen as soon as next month.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise this evening to make some remarks about the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, which I think is one of the great contributions of Australian Liberalism to environmental conservation and preservation. This trust was set up almost 20 years ago today by the Howard government. The environment minister of the day, Robert Hill, said, in announcing the plan for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Trust will be established with a ten year life and be required to manage the properties in accordance with the Howard government's goals of maximising public access to the sites, cleaning up the contamination, rehabilitating bushland and preserving heritage buildings and features at the sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is exactly what the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust has done over these last 20 years. You now see extraordinary access to the public across these sites at Middle Head, North Head and further south.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the Morrison government's commitment to the environment, we commissioned a review into the harbour trust 18 months ago. I thought, as an active senator for New South Wales, that I would engage with that review. I put in a submission back in January last year which said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When the camera pans around Sydney, it starts at North Head. Trust assets are iconic, beautiful and unique. The preservation and maintenance of the natural environment is essential in maintaining Sydney's place as Australia's global city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That review has delivered a slew of recommendations, which our government has adopted, funded and followed quite closely. In the budget, in October, the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, provided $40 million for further rehabilitation of trust sites so that people can go to North Head, which hosts the Quarantine Station, or go to Middle Harbour, which hosts the iconic 10 Terminal buildings. And, in time, there will be more public access, which I think is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major issues that the community has mobilised against has been the idea that these lands would be locked up for developers and for private interests. That is not something that our government was prepared to support. In fact, in yesterday announcing the legislation that will embed this trust in perpetuity, the Minister for the Environment, Sussan Ley, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are ensuring the ongoing future of the Harbour Trust and delivering on our commitment to keep its wonderful sites in public hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the minister dealt with this question of leasing by saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Under the proposed leasing arrangements, commercial leases for appropriate sites will have a maximum term of 35 years with leases of longer than 25 years subject to a disallowance by Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have delivered a structure which has preserved these unique, pristine lands for public access. Over the 20 years, more of those buildings and more of those sites have become accessible. And now we have put in place a framework so that these sites will be protected forever by the Commonwealth. I know it's unusual that the national government would run a trust like this, but these are arguably some of the most iconic pieces of land in the world, and it's very important that we have control over these lands to maintain our trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on the extraordinary volunteer program. For the last 20 years, there have been hundreds of volunteers who have given their time to help preserve these sites. I want to pay special tribute to the Headland Preservation Group and its president, Jill L'Estrange, who have done so much and have given so much of their time to preserve and conserve these lands. I've met many of the volunteers when I've been on the harbour trust sites. They keep the bushwalks going. They look after the place. They really are so proud of their work, and we're proud of them. That volunteer ethos is such an important part of maintaining those lands. I know there has been great consternation about where these lands would go in the future, and this government has made it very clear that it is keeping the trust permanently. It won't be a transitional body. We will be putting more money into it and we won't be allowing really long-term leases which put at risk any sense of public access to these unique and pristine lands. I thank again the Headland Preservation Group and all the volunteers who have kept these lands in pristine form.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  McCormick Australia workers in Victoria are taking strong strike action, and have been for the last three weeks. These are the workers who make the sauces for some of Australia's favourite fast food chains, like McDonald's, Hungry Jacks, Subway and Nando's. These workers are taking action because for the last five years they have been subjected to a wage freeze—five years of hard work and five years without thanks from their company, which is actually very profitable. Now, after working tirelessly throughout the pandemic by putting food in restaurants for all of us, what are they being offered? A wage freeze—a wage freeze and cuts to their penalty rates. What a kick in the guts! When I visited these workers three weeks ago I promised to bring their stories to Canberra, so here are those stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jana has worked at McCormick for 18 years. She enjoys her work so much that she wants to work there until retirement. But she feels totally and completely disrespected by this company today. Mary is 55 and she's been working at McCormick for 33 years. She's a machine operator and she loves her job, but she's being seriously undervalued by this workplace. And there's Steph. Steph has been working at McCormick for 13 years and her mum, Mary France, for 21 years. Their entire household works at McCormick and they currently have no income at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of these workers for taking this action and for demanding the pay and respect they've worked hard for during the last five years. I am proud to stand with these workers. I call on McCormick to come to the table and to give these workers a fair offer. But the stories of these women are just the height of what is happening right across the country in Scott Morrison's Australia: stagnant wages and insecure work. People are saying enough is enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get wages moving in this country. This government should be using the pandemic as an opportunity to build a better future, to make us stronger than we were before COVID-19 and not to entrench further insecure work. On our side, we believe that you should be paid fairly for the work that you do and that our road to recovery should be built on a big and bold jobs plan. That is what this country needs going forward, but Scott Morrison can't even come up with a plan for good secure jobs. All he knows, and all the Liberals know, is how to suppress wages, how to freeze super and how to ensure workers are worse off in life. If they force their nasty IR bill through this parliament then more and more workers will face what the McCormick workers are facing: disrespect that runs so deep that people suffer a five-year wage freeze.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a missed opportunity by this government. This government could be giving people hope, they could be giving people stability and they could be giving people jobs that they can actually plan a future around. Last year we heard the Morrison government thank and praise our essential workers, but we always knew that these were hollow words. This government has yet to show its thanks and gratitude by rewarding workers with any kind of jobs plan—a plan for strong wages and secure jobs that they can count on. Australian workers deserve so much better and McCormick workers deserve so much better. We owe it to them, their employers owe it to them and this government owes it to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It shouldn't take workers marching off the job to see a rise in their pay packets. It shouldn't be commonplace for employers to engage in five-year wage freezes. What should be commonplace is for employers to actually respect their workers. But how can we expect to see that when our own government won't respect Australian workers? Australians deserve better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  A year and a half ago I spoke about the statutory review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. I reflected on the previous review from 2010, which identified a number of issues with the act and made a series of recommendations. Unfortunately, those findings were not acted on and the recommendations were not implemented. It was very much a missed opportunity for reform. That speech called on the government to learn the lesson of 2010, to take the 2020 review seriously, to use the opportunity to build on the strengths of the EPBC regime and to fix whatever issues were identified. Since that time, Professor Samuel has concluded his review and found Australia's environment is in a state of unsustainable decline. The review found the act is failing to protect the environment or conserve our biodiversity. It showed the EPBC Act is not fit for purpose. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, the review does not just set out the many problems with the act but also provides a comprehensive reform agenda, changes that would facilitate economic development while properly protecting our environment. This review is exactly what we needed, a clear look at what is broken and how it can be fixed. But the government response, unbelievably, makes it difficult to have confidence this review will be more successful than the one back in 2010. Transparency is essential for any genuine reform process, but it has been conspicuously absent so far. They spent months delaying publication of the review. They spent months obstructing a Senate inquiry into the streamlining bill. They proposed an inquiry of just two weeks for the standards bill and, after five months, they have still not responded to the review. Their plans are a mystery to us all. We don't know where they agree with the review and where they disagree. We don't know which recommendations they will act on and which they will totally ignore. We don't know what changes they want to make now and what changes they will make in the future or just completely disregard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants us to support its reform bills. But how can anyone support legislation without understanding the effects? How can we support legislation without knowing the broader policy context? All we know is that the government wants to accelerate project approvals by devolving assessments to state and territory governments. There is merit to such policy as long as it is done in the right way with effective environmental standards and an independent regulator very much being part of a broad reform agenda. But where are the effective standards? Where is the independent regulator? Where is the broad reform agenda? Until these questions are answered, we cannot have confidence that the government intends to follow through and fix the many issues with the EPBC Act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance will not support the government abandoning its responsibilities. A serious policy problem has been identified and it is the government's duty to resolve it. The very first step must be the release of a comprehensive response to the review, something we would have thought would have been well and truly out by now. We need a review and a response which sets out the government's plans and priorities and provides a road map for the implementation of its reforms. After they respond we can consider our next steps, but if there were ever a need for government to take action, an agenda for reform and an opportunity for change, this is it. I can only hope that this review will not be another missed opportunity. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Last year I rose in this chamber to talk about the #nobordersforboarders campaign. I introduced to the chamber the story of Barney and Charlie from near Bourke, who travel 900 kilometres to attend boarding school in Victoria and who last year, when their campus was closed, faced the prospect of flying through Melbourne, a COVID hotspot, to Sydney and isolating unaccompanied for two weeks in Sydney before driving 1,200 kilometres back to school. They instead opted to do remote schooling at their boarding house at their closed Victorian school, isolated from their friends and family during a time that, many would agree, was stressful for all. Through negotiations and the efforts of groups like the Isolated Children's Parents Association we were able to get the state authorities to see reason and enable Barney and Charlie to return home. We also worked very hard to get other school students who board across state lines to be able to join their families at home for holidays and then return to school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key issues, and the need for the 'no borders for boarders' campaign, was the haphazard introduction of border closures by states across the country, with unclear rules and regulations and unclear exemption requirements that changed on each occasion of border closures. So imagine my excitement when I heard that the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Phil Gaetjens, had been appointed to head a new task force that would report to national cabinet and that one of its key terms of reference was to work on a nationally consistent approach to responding to the COVID pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Select Committee on COVID-19 heard from Mr Gaetjens last week and, as a member of the committee, I asked what that nationally consistent approach would look like: Do we have a nationally consistent approach to shutting down borders? Do we have a nationally consistent approach to addressing hotspots such that, when Premier Daniel Andrews says it is easier to close a border than to ring fence a hotspot, we won't face that into the future? Unfortunately, what I heard from Mr Gaetjens was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… states are sovereign governments … the chief health officers have statutory powers, and those statutory powers are not something that the Commonwealth can wind back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I appreciate that states are sovereign governments, how hard is it for state governments to agree on a set of rules and trigger points so that the people of their states and the people of this nation can understand when they might face border closures and when they might face these incredible restrictions? Is it going to be when we have 13 cases of community transmission or a hundred cases of community transmission or one case of community transmission? We just don't know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was invited to make a presentation at the annual general conference of the Isolated Children's Parents Association in New South Wales. I got to meet some of the families I was able to help last year, and their gratitude was absolutely humbling. But what was concerning was that these families still don't know whether they will have to face the same sort of tumult again if we have other cases of community transmission during the pandemic. I implore the states to come together and agree to a nationally consistent approach.</span>
