                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends relevant legislation to put a positive obligation on gambling companies to report to AUSTRAC if they have any reason to suspect a person is paying for a gambling service with money that they've obtained illegally. And where a better has paid for a gambling service using funds they did obtain illegally, the bill enables the Federal Court to order the gambling company to compensate the injured party for their loss. In other words, the bill will reduce the opportunity for gambling companies to profit from the misfortune of others and ensure that gambling entities are held accountable by preventing them profiting from illegal behaviour in particular. It targets the unconscionable conduct of gambling companies to ensure that the money they receive from betters has not been obtained at the misfortune of innocent parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of background, Australians continue to be the world's biggest gambling losers per capita. Indeed, according to the latest annual figures of <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Gambling Statistics</span>, Australians lost over $25 billion in 2018-2019, which equates to $1,276 per person, for every person. And it's getting worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, according to the Australian Institute of Family Studies' report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Gambling </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n Australia During COVID</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-19</span>, dated October 2020, one in three survey participants signed up for a new online betting account during the early days of the pandemic. Even with limited access to venues, overall, participants were gambling more often. Indeed, the proportion who gambled four or more times a week increased from 23 per cent to 32 per cent. Of particular concern, 79 per cent of participants were classified as being at risk of, or already experiencing, gambling related harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Australian Communications and Media Authority's annual consumer survey, more recently, in 2022, found that online gambling increased significantly between 2020 and 2021. Indeed, the percentage of Australians who participated in online gambling was sitting steady at approximately eight per cent up until 2020, but this increased dramatically to 11 per cent in 2021. Moreover, 16 per cent of those surveyed reported gambling at a higher frequency than before the pandemic. According to other research—and this comes really to the essence of the bill—there is a clear correlation between problem gambling and crime. Moreover, the more complex, prolonged and persistent the gambling problem, the more likely it is that a crime will be committed. But, while there is a growing understanding that gambling addiction is a behavioural disorder, this has not been translated into sentencing by the courts. Indeed, problem gambling is, bizarrely, not considered to be a mitigating factor in sentencing in the same way that mental health problems or drug and alcohol addiction are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, I'd like to acknowledge Mr Gavin Fineff, who is the inspiration for this bill and who has helped to develop it. Gavin is a former financial adviser who lost more than $8 million of his clients' money through gambling after he was targeted by three of the country's biggest online betting agencies. Yes, Gavin understands that he did the wrong thing, takes full responsibility for his actions and will accept any punishment meted out by the courts, without appeal. But he feels he is not the only one to blame, and he is right, considering the predatory practices of the gambling companies as they took advantage of Gavin's gambling addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First there was Tabcorp, where Gavin was quickly promoted to VIP status, assigned a personal customer service manager and offered special treatment, including events, experiences and bonus money to bet with. Of course he was, because Gavin was gambling and losing big-time. Indeed, from September 2016 to June 2018 there were 194 times when he deposited $10,000 or more into his TAB account and 23 times when he made a withdrawal of more than $10,000 from his account, 10 of which were for $50,000. But, as Gavin continued to lose more and more money, rather than offering him support, Tabcorp fuelled his growing addiction with bonus money and tickets to sporting events to encourage his gambling. All the while, Tabcorp never intervened—never asked Gavin for proof of funds, never asked for proof of income and never showed the slightest interest in where all the money was coming from—until it was too late and Gavin had lost almost $4 million. Yes, his TAB account was eventually frozen, but this didn't stop the predatory gambling companies from continuing to knock on his door.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, there was Ladbrokes. About three weeks after his Tabcorp account was frozen, Gavin was contacted by representatives from that company, completely out of the blue, who offered to sign Gavin up with a 'superior experience', including thousands of dollars in bonus bets. When Gavin disclosed that his Tabcorp account had been frozen, the Ladbrokes representative facilitated an account under a false name. He was never asked for identification nor, again, asked for proof of income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there was BetEasy. A few months after signing with Ladbrokes, where he lost close to $700,000, Gavin was contacted out of the blue by gambling company BetEasy, who set up an account for Gavin and gave him $50,000 in free bonus bets, which he lost within the space of 45 minutes. Over the next 16 months, Gavin lost approximately $3.6 million with BetEasy. And, again, BetEasy never asked him for proof of income and only checked his identification in the last two months of his gambling with that company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me back to the bill. Gavin Fineff believes—and I agree with him—that he was deliberately targeted by the gambling companies for his addiction. Of course the betting agencies would have known that Gavin's gambling was suspicious, because their software tracks certain behaviour and hunts down the most vulnerable so they can be groomed and milked of every dollar they have. And this must stop, because gambling companies are preying on the financially and emotionally vulnerable and must be held accountable for their unconscionable and unethical behaviour. So, while I in no way condone Gavin's behaviour, I do acknowledge that an addict, by definition, has lost control of their behaviour and that the bigger crims are those that knowingly create the addiction in the first place. At least Gavin is prepared to try and do something about it, and good on him for that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now invite the member for Mayo, who is seconding the bill, to contribute to the debate in my remaining time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I wholeheartedly second this motion. I rise to speak in support of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment (Making Gambling Businesses Accountable) Bill 2022, because this bill will provide just an inch of accountability. It will put the onus on gambling companies. As the member for Clark said, back in 2018—I think it's the latest figure—$25 billion was lost by Australians, and an estimated 7.2 per cent of Australians, over 1.3 million of us, are already at risk or experiencing problematic gambling, harmful gambling, according to the Australian Gambling Research Centre in 2021. These statistics are horrendous. We are, per capita, the biggest gambling losers out of all the nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just unbelievable that we in this place do so little with respect to addressing the vulnerabilities of people who are addicts—and they are addicts. Gambling damages relationships, health and emotional and psychological wellbeing. What I find particularly galling is that for, really, the entire time on the weekend and any time there's sport on the television you get the adverts: 'Gamble with mates'. They're really cool and they get overseas stars to be in them. It's pervasive. It's every advert break, one after the other, one after the other, and they are targeted at young men who are watching sport. They're targeted at my children, my sons, and it's outrageous. I think that we should at least be banning these gambling advertisements during children's hours and during daylight hours. The fine-print warning to gamble responsibly is, I think, disingenuous, when we allow the gambling companies to behave the way they have—the way the member for Clark has outlined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to hold them accountable and they need to be more responsible. We need to do more in this place. Enacting this bill would allow victims of such theft to recoup compensation from the gambling firms who are ultimately reaping huge, huge rewards. I commend this bill to the House as an important first step in helping to address gambling harm that impacts our whole society.</span>

The tragic events in New Orleans and in other southern states in the United States of America highlight exactly what can be expected from the impact of climate change. We cannot any longer afford to be complacent on this issue. We need action and one of the actions that we need, which has been acknowledged for many years, is this amendment to the EPBC Act.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, a class of significant emissions.<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"></span>For projects that would emit between 25,000 to 100,000 tonnes of scope 1 emissions in any one year, including in pre-construction stage, the minister must consider the project through part 9 of the act, as the minister currently does with other matters of national environmental significance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this assessment, the minister must consider this: will the project be consistent with the remaining national carbon budget we have left until we hit net zero?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill obliges the Climate Change Authority to develop a national carbon budget to 2050 to be updated annually so everyone is clear just how little scope we have left to burn fossil fuels.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second threshold is a prohibited impact on emissions. For projects that would emit above 100,000 tonnes in any one year, these projects would be treated similarly to nuclear projects under the act, where the minister is forced to reject any application for the project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will require the minister to also consider the remaining national carbon budget and Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets when deciding whether to enter into a conservation agreement, and the bill also allows these considerations to inform bioregional plans. This is designed to allow climate change considerations to be factored into planning considerations more broadly.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  I second the motion. We are at one of the most critical crossroads in our nation's history. We in this parliament have the opportunity to make the right decisions for our future, for the future of our children and grandchildren. Our current Prime Minister said 17 years ago that it was time to act on a climate trigger bill. Tragically, since then, the profits of coal and gas corporations have been put ahead of climate action, and the urgency of our situation has multiplied exponentially.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already living the catastrophes caused by climate inaction. We knew then what we needed to do, and we didn't do it. That is why there are now so many new faces in this House—to act. No more time for procrastination, as Mr Albanese said then. Now, Mr Albanese is in the position to act. We know our biggest contribution to climate change is the burning of coal and gas. We know there are 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline. And we know that, even if a handful of these projects go ahead, we can kiss goodbye to any hope of ever meeting the known targets to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees. We know that going above 1.5 degrees of heating means wholesale catastrophe and an uninhabitable, unimaginable world for all our grandchildren. These are facts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How could any one of us in this House with any conscience, with any sense of responsibility, allow this? How can we sit here, when we have the collective power to do something, and not do it? This bill does something. With the two threshold triggers and the alternative approval prohibitions, it will finally put a safe future for all of us ahead of coal and gas profits.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, 3.5 million Australians have a mortgage. Four successive interest rate rises and uncontrolled inflation are crushing the quality of life for these Australians from two directions: firstly, real wages are rapidly eroding; and, secondly, the budgets of small businesses and Australian families are being smashed with ballooning interest rate payments. Making ends meet for Australians is becoming increasingly more challenging with the current economy, and experts are warning that the real pain for families and small businesses is still months away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has now been in power for more than 100 days. Last month the Reserve Bank of Australia increased rates for the fourth successive month in a row. It is noted that the RBA, again, meets tomorrow. Australians with a mortgage of $610,000 are now paying over $500 more per month on their mortgage than they were paying in May. Whilst interest rate decisions should remain the decision of an independent Reserve Bank, the government has not brought forward any plan to address cost-of-living pressures on families and also on small businesses. Instead, Labor has already walked away from its election commitment to cut power bills by $275. Similarly, Labor has already walked away from its commitment to deliver real wage increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must improve its budget position. This is the most crucial decision the government can make to ease inflationary pressures. It is what the coalition did in government, and it is what enabled the largest budget recovery in over 70 years: a $100 billion turnaround confirmed in the pre-election fiscal outlook. The government would have more credibility attacking the coalition's government debt levels if it was not proposing to add significantly to that debt. The Parliamentary Budget Office confirmed that only the coalition's election promises would put Australia on a pathway to financial resilience and, crucially, a better bottom line than Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us revisit the coalition's record. The coalition ensured that Australia's recovery led the world on economic and jobs growth. The coalition government focused on jobs and small business, as we believe in liberalism, innovation, entrepreneurship and that a strong economy delivers improved living standards and better services for all Australians. More than two million jobs were created under the coalition government. Under the coalition government, unemployment hit 50-year lows. The coalition provided lower taxes to 10 million Australians. The coalition delivered a $250 cost-of-living payment to nearly six million pensioners, welfare recipients, veterans and eligible concession card holders. The coalition cut the fuel excise in half, for six months, saving a family with two cars around $30 per week. The coalition cut the cost of medicines and slashed health costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in stark contrast to the current government, which, to date—after more than 100 days—has not shown Australians any plan to reduce the cost of living and no overall economic plan for Australia. Over the last 30 years, Labor governments, without exception, have delivered higher unemployment and higher electricity prices.</span>

                  </a>  There is no evidence so far that this government will be any different. However, the coalition will hold this government to account. While nobody blames the government for many of the circumstances challenging Australia's economy, the government has both the opportunity and the levers to be proactive in its response to these challenges. Government is about making tough decisions in tough circumstances, not merely paying lip-service and announcing that planning is underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The risk to Australia is that whilst ever the government continues to procrastinate but fails to deliver, life simply becomes much harder for Australian families and small businesses. The government must now adopt and release a plan to ease pressures on the cost of living for Australian families and small businesses now, rather than waiting for an October budget.</span>

                  <a href="133646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  I was just speculating with my colleagues whether the shadow minister wrote that speech, and, given he seconded it, perhaps he did. I'm going to give the member for Hughes this credit: she wasn't in the parliament for the last term, so, of course, didn't witness firsthand, in this place, what that government was like. It was not the fairytale that was just contained in that speech, that's for sure. But I assume the member for Hughes was in the community in the last three years and was in the community for the nine years in which the Liberal-National government did everything it could, one suspects, to trash the Australian people's trust in politics and government. It did everything it could, one suspects, to undermine the fundamental institutions of this democracy and government for—I don't know what. For their own benefit? It wasn't for the benefit of the Australian people. The member for Hughes started her speech for her motion by saying 'Real wages are rapidly eroding.' That hasn't happened in the last 100 days, you need to know. Eroding wages was a deliberate design feature of the last government. It's something which Australians have been struggling with for a very long time and which the previous government ignored because it was a deliberate design feature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a new government that, in the first 100 days, argued to the Fair Work Commission to increase the minimum wage so that the wages of the lowest paid workers in this country could at least keep up with inflation. Now we have a government that is prepared to go to the Fair Work Commission and literally put its money where its mouth is and support a pay increase for aged-care workers—a highly feminised industry with some of the poorest paid workers in this country and some of the most important workers in this country, who are caring for older, vulnerable Australians—so they can get a pay rise. And we finally have a government that says, 'We're prepared to do the work we need to do to back that pay rise.' The member for Hughes says, 'Oh, well, this government has no credibility because it would spend more than the last government.' It would spend taxpayer money in areas that benefit the people that are struggling, not in areas that benefit the people who are already doing so well and are already privileged. That's the difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I kick myself because sometimes I give the other side a bit of credit, thinking maybe, if they've been running a line that's not particularly truthful and isn't working, they might give it up and come back to the next sitting of parliament with something else. But, no, we're going to hear again, apparently, for the next two weeks, that the government has walked away from its election promise to reduce power prices. I don't know if I have to remind you, Member for Hughes—and the shadow member at the table, Member for Herbert—but I will: there was a report about the increase in prices that was hidden by the former government before the election that we had to release. I also will explain to you that our promise about reducing power prices is part of our promise to act on climate change and invest in renewable energy, to have 83 per cent of the grid be renewable energy by 2030, to reduce emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. That's how prices will be reduced and that's how we will be working towards protecting our environment and protecting the future. A ridiculous debate, based not on fact, about promises from the election is going to do nothing to address the cost of living or to move things forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you say we don't have a plan, we've got a plan that's already helped low-paid workers increase wages. We've got a plan to address the bargaining system in this country, which has meant that wages and productivity haven't increased. The budget has measures for cheaper medicine. We've had a Jobs and Skills Summit which has come up with a range of options to increase workers' value and productivity and deal with cost of living. We've got a plan for cheaper child care. We've got a plan for more bulk billing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

In response to that they need a government that does two things. First of all, it needs to care. It needs to see this as a top priority in its agenda. It needs to be something it is responding to right here right now. That leads to the second thing they need, which is a plan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time we faced a curveball in government—and you do face curveballs in government; that's the nature of it, and particularly the last couple of years have been tumultuous—understandably, those on the opposite side of this place were very fond of saying, 'You need to take responsibility and you need to have a plan.' When a curveball comes at them they ignore it and say: 'No, we don't need to have a plan. We don't need to take responsibility.' The truth is Australians want them to have a plan. I'll tell you why—because they are feeling pain when they are at the bowser, they are feeling pain when they pay their bills, they are feeling pain at the check-out and they are feeling pain when they upgrade their house. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All we get from those opposite is a vanity project—the job summit last week. Do you know what we got out of that vanity project last week? We got a return to the 1970s. I lived through the 1970s. Tie-dye was alright. ELO was one of the better productions of the 1970s. I'll tell you what was wrong with the 1970s—inflation. That is the cost of living. The cost of living was off the charts. ELO might have been on the charts, but the cost of living was off the charts. It was insanely high. We saw interest rates going to a level where families like mine, farmers and small-business people, were in extreme pain. We saw that for real.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. We have seen a series of 50-basis-point interest-rate increases since the election, and those increases are only being felt now. Indeed, the first has been felt from 1 September because it takes several months for these things to flow through. By Christmas—just at the time when families are spending money on presents for their loved ones, on getting together at that wonderful time of the year and on going on holidays—they are going to be feeling the extreme pain of these mortgage repayments. That'll be in November and December. We and the market are expecting a further increase coming through tomorrow, which in a few months time will flow through to their mortgage repayments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the government have no plan to deal with this. The best we got last week was a return to pattern bargaining—a race between wages and prices. We know from experience that, ultimately, real wages lose. That's what happens. You wreck the economy. That's what happens. There is an alternative, which is a comprehensive economywide plan that recognises the full range of cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are walking away from their election promises. They have walked away from their electricity price promise. We haven't heard the Prime Minister or the relevant minister once confirming that election policy—not once in this place, and I'll make a fair bet that they won't do that today either. We have seen them break promises on material increases in real wages. They have given up on that. We saw that in their economic statement. Those opposite have no plan to deal with the cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  The contribution that we've just heard from the member for Hume really did sum up the last decade of the government in which he served. There was no plan, and the economy that we on this side of the House are facing at the moment comes directly from the policies that they didn't have or didn't do anything about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are currently facing some of the most difficult economic challenges in a generation, and the circumstances that bring them about are extraordinary. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being felt and are causing extreme fragility in the global economy. Our economy is inextricably linked to the overall movements of the rest of the world. COVID shutdowns in China and border closures at home have contributed to massive disruptions in supply chains. Together with soaring prices across the economy and stagnant wages they have been a deadly combination for Australian families. The previous government's deliberate policy of keeping wages stagnant for almost a decade has contributed to the pain that families are experiencing, especially those in the electorate of Werriwa, which I represent. For some years, Werriwa residents have been affected by rental stress and mortgage stress, with postcodes in my electorate featuring in the top 10 for both those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The change in government has brought with it a change in policy for workers, who have kept the country running during the pandemic. Australia now has a government that is willing to make changes to improve the lives of working Australians. One of our first acts in government was a submission to the Fair Work Commission in support of an increase to the minimum wage, and, pleasingly, that happened. Last week the Jobs and Skills Summit came up with positive ideas for addressing the skills shortages that are affecting all sectors of the economy and have been for some considerable amount of time. It identified areas of reform in our industrial relations system to drive real wage growth and productivity. One of the key announcements from the Jobs and Skills Summit is the addition of 180,000 fee-free TAFE places, because our government understands that education is the foundation of prosperity and is needed for the Australian workforce. It is vital that Australians can acquire new skills to find well-paid and secure jobs for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While wage increases are one aspect of addressing cost-of-living pressures, they are not the only policy area. We know that electricity prices are soaring, and that is linked to the previous coalition government's—and that minister's—policy failings. With 22 different energy policies over nine years, is it any wonder that the energy grid is failing to provide consumers with the cheaper forms of energy it needs to drive down prices? With no national leadership, the market stagnated. The resulting energy grid consists of ageing power assets that are increasingly unreliable and costly to run, and that is a cost that's being felt every day by Australians. The passage of the climate bill in the lower house means that the energy market and those people investing in it finally have certainty. The alignment of federal and state governments means Australian families can be provided with the cheapest forms of energy, putting downward pressure on energy bills in the long term. Strong wage growth, one energy policy and well-paid, secure jobs—that's what we've done in 100 days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has committed to tackling both the short-term impacts of the pandemic and the structural issues that have been slowly chipping away at the economic security of Australians. It has supported wage rises for aged-care workers. Today, importantly, it announced that 4.7 million Australians will receive government payment increases. This is the largest indexation increase in more than 30 years for allowances and in 12 years for pensions. The Albanese government has a plan to address the cost-of-living crisis for everyday Australians. With over one-third of Australians suffering chronic illness, it is important that we reduce the price of medications, and that's what we'll do in the October budget. And we know that one of the largest barriers to women coming back into the workforce is the cost of child care. That's why we will be introducing legislation for cheaper child care for more than 1.26 million families. The Albanese government understands that tackling the cost-of-living crisis requires structural adjustments to how our economy works, and we will do just that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I commend the mover of the motion, the member for Hughes, on bringing this important subject into this chamber. I think most Australians, if stopped in the street, would say that cost-of-living pressures were the most significant thing that they were concerned about. It's something that's causing a great deal of apprehension amongst the families of Australia, who are confronting real, significant pressures from multiple fronts when it comes to the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Reserve Bank meeting tomorrow, and, regrettably, there is a high likelihood that interest rates will be increasing again. One of the largest burdens on the household budget is meeting the cost of your mortgage, for those that have a mortgage. Petrol prices have been sustained at a high level for a significant period of time, and very shortly the temporary reduction in the fuel excise is going to be removed. With other indexation, a 25c-a-litre increase in the cost of unleaded fuel is going to put an enormous amount of additional pressure onto families in this country, on top of already paying higher petrol prices. Electricity prices are also going up at a remarkably high rate, with increases of more than 10 per cent in some jurisdictions within the National Electricity Market having come into effect from 1 July. And, of course, real wages are decreasing—wages in this country are growing at a lower rate than inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is absolutely appalling is that anyone would commit a great fraud on the people of this country by going to an election in May saying they're going to reduce cost-of-living pressures, they're going to reduce electricity prices and they're going to increase real wages, and subsequently failing to keep those promises. That is an absolute disgrace—a break of a covenant that was put in place through a campaign of lies and misinformation that the Labor Party ran at the recent election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at electricity. We never hear this $275 figure anymore. It has not been uttered out of the lips of anyone, particularly the Prime Minister and the relevant ministers, since the election. But in the election campaign they said, 'We're going to implement an electricity and energy policy which will reduce electricity prices for the average household consumer by $275.' That was a very simple commitment that was given. They didn't have to give that commitment; they chose to. If it turns out to be a lie, then that will be an absolute disgrace, and a significant electoral cost will be inflicted on them for lying to people about that. Meeting electricity costs is one of the most significant challenges that households have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party said, 'We modelled these electricity price reductions, and that's how we know we can achieve them,' so, despite any spurious argument about existing policies of previous governments going back over the last 10 years, those policies would have been taken into account in the modelling that you did. If it were reputable modelling, if it were robust, there would be no way that you could say with a straight face that anything of significance had changed since you made that commitment. The only thing we can deduce, therefore, is that you knew you weren't going to meet it but you thought, 'We'll lie to people to get their vote, and we'll deal with the consequences of that after we've won an election and we're in government.' Well, the chickens are coming home to roost right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You're far from achieving that $275, so come clean and own up to it. Say: 'Yes, look, for all these reasons, we're no longer going to achieve the $275. It was someone else's fault, but, yes, when we said that it was a lie.' And now electricity prices are not going down; they're going up. They're going up by more than 10 per cent. The Labor Party went to an election and misled the people of this country on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They misled them on real wages, as well. They said, 'We're going to get real wages growing,' and we got lectures when they were in opposition about how real wages worked. When you look at the—</span>

                  </a>  Certainly. Through you, Deputy Speaker: the Labor Party lied at the last election during the campaign. They lied to the people of this country, and there is an enormous political price that the Labor Party will pay for that. When you mislead the people of this country—they trust you and they take you at your word, they vote for you, you get into power and then you break those promises you made—there is an enormous consequence for those lies, which the people of this country will mete out against the Labor Party. I welcome the opportunity to contest that at the upcoming election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr GOSLING:</span>
                  </a>  As you know, many Australians are doing it particularly tough right now. The costs of fuel, groceries, child care, utilities, housing and mortgages—everything—are going up, so many people rightly feel that they will be overwhelmed as household budgets get tighter and tighter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the claptrap we just heard from the member opposite, those opposite left us with many ticking time bombs. They pursued a deliberate strategy to suppress wage growth. That was for a decade, and they were proud of it. They said suppressing the wages of working people in this nation was actually part of their plan. That has led to the crisis that we're in. They did very little to diversify our economy and therefore left us very vulnerable to the shocks we saw when they mishandled the China relationship. China imposed bans on our exports, and that hurt a lot of Aussie producers and businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government understands and has already begun work, after just over 100 days in government, to address some of these deep systemic problems—mostly the result of the ineptitude of those opposite. We must ensure that wages keep pace with the cost of living. The rewriting of history by some of those opposite is understandable, with them having lost the election and trying to explain it away, but the reality is that one of the big reasons they were unsuccessful in the election is that the Australian people knew that those opposite were cooked and did not have a plan to address some of the big issues that we face as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Albanese government has a plan. We have committed to making child care more affordable for 97 per cent of families, which doesn't help our kids only: it helps parents get back into the workplace, meaning more money for families and a huge boost to productivity in our economy. It's also why we lifted the minimum wage in line with inflation, so Aussies earning lower incomes aren't losing pay. Our Powering Australia plan will cut power bills for households as we do this important work of pivoting our economy towards renewables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also committed to improving the affordability and uptake of electric vehicles, something that those opposite dismissed and derided as 'ending the weekend'. How ridiculous not to see where the trends are going in terms of affordability of electric vehicles and how that's going to help household budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as fuel prices go, we have seen them rise significantly over the last decade. My constituents in Darwin, like many other regional Australians, are being gouged by the fuel retailers. Ninety-seven per cent of our refined fuel is imported. Renewable technology is obviously the way of the future, so why not invest in that and use what is very clearly to our advantage? I am running in my electorate a concerted campaign against the fuel retailers, because, even as the oil price did drop, they were taking too much in terms of profits. We'll continue to point out to them how unethical it is, how greedy it is and how it's not in the interests of our national economy to keep gouging Australians when it comes to fuel. We want Australians to pay less for their commute to work, whilst they are dropping the kids off at school or going away for the weekend, and all those things will not disappear just because their next car may have a battery in it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Continuing to rely on foreign oil would punish Australians and their household budgets. We know that renewable technologies will take some time to be implemented, but our government, the Albanese government, is committed to looking forward not just towards this next term of parliament and the one after but towards the coming decades. We want to build an Australia with a lower cost of living and with higher living standards, especially for those who are on lower incomes and who are struggling to get by at the moment. Australians can count on the Albanese government to do just that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  There is no doubt when I am in Casey, talking to my residents and constituents, that cost of living is the biggest issue that they face today. There is an old saying that I like: if you spend too much time looking into the rear-vision mirror while you're driving, you'll crash into the car in front of you. Listening to the government continue to talk over the last three months about the previous government shows that their eyes are clearly focused on the rear-vision mirror. That's because they don't have a plan to address the rising cost of living. They have no plan to tackle the economic challenges that we face today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's indulge the government's obsession with the rear-vision mirror for a moment and look back to March and April of 2020. We all remember the lines at Centrelink and the Treasury prediction of 15 to 20 per cent unemployment. I was not an MP at the time. I was working in business, worried for the future. I watched the coalition government ensure that Australia's recovery led the world on economic growth and jobs growth, all with lower debt levels relative to other advanced countries. The coalition government focused on jobs, as we know the ability to get a job and to keep it gives Australians more opportunities to manage their household budget and make the best choices for their families. I remember the then shadow Treasurer saying the test of the government was the unemployment level. With it currently sitting at 3.4 per cent, hitting a 50-year low, the former government well and truly passed that test. The Treasurer would do well to remember that the next time he says Australians have nothing to show for the current debt levels. We all know that, without the then government's support, businesses, particularly small businesses, would have closed and unemployment would have hit those terrifying projected numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor promised the world during the election campaign, but the only thing they have been able to deliver is a string of broken promises. They have abandoned their commitment to cut power bills by $275 a year for the average Australian, a practical measure that could have made a difference to millions of Australians. Worse than having no plan, this government can't even accept a good idea and implement it immediately to help pensioners and veterans with their cost-of-living pressures and businesses with labour shortages. It took three months for the government to adopt our position on allowing pensioners and veterans to work more hours without impacting their pension. That is three months they could have been earning more as the economic clouds were looming, three months in which they could have possibly saved a little as prices continued to rise. To make pensioners and veterans wait three months to announce the policy at the jobs summit shows this government will always put politics and optics over the interests of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this is going on as interest rates rise. This is already hurting many Australians who are doing it tough. If the Treasurer fails to act, it will mean more pressure from inflation, more pressure from interest rates and higher costs of living for Australian families and small businesses. The single most important thing any government can do to help ease inflationary pressure is improve their budget position. That's what the coalition government did in government. We saw in recent years the largest budget turnaround in over 70 years—around $100 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has no plan to reduce the cost of living and no economic plan for Australia. The Labor Party went to the last election promising to run bigger deficits. This was confirmed by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. By contrast, the PBO confirmed that the coalition were the only parties that went to the election with a pathway to improve the budget bottom line. The coalition's 2022-23 budget was balancing, and Labor extracted all these efforts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 30 years, Labor governments have, on average, delivered higher unemployment, higher interest rates and higher electricity prices. This Labor government will do the same. Labor can't manage the economy and can't manage money. I just hope that the government stops looking in the rear-vision mirror and focuses on the road ahead. The last thing Australia needs right now is a crash.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  Sometimes you have to pinch yourself, and this motion is one of those occasions. Here we are in this chamber; we've formed government. And there's a trillion dollars of debt, with not enough to show for it. The fact that members of the Liberal Party want to talk about cost of living—the crisis they created—is just extraordinary. Seriously! The party that admitted they deliberately kept wages low for a decade now has the audacity to come into this House and pretend they care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, one of the biggest cost-of-living pressures on families in the electorate of Lalor and around the nation at the moment is the availability of doctors and the cost of seeing one. This is a direct result, in my community, of changes to the distribution priority area funding that saw our area lose 40 per cent of local GPs. Let us not forget who froze Medicare rebates, let's not forget who changed the rules so those local GP clinics couldn't recruit more doctors and let's not forget who wanted to tax every single visit to the GP: the worst health minister, it was said at the time, since 1980, who's now the Leader of the Opposition. Trash, attack and tax Medicare, and you get promoted in the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's not forget, too, that they hid, prior to the election, a massive hike in electricity prices. In fact, high electricity prices are the result of the fact that they had 22 ineffective energy policies. Imagine how much better off families would be to manage the cost-of-living pressures they now face if the previous Liberal government hadn't made low wages growth a deliberate design feature of their economic plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is already addressing the cost-of-living pressures Australians are facing. We've supported a $1-an-hour increase in pay for Australia's lowest-paid workers, helping millions across the country—something those opposite said would cause the sky to fall in. We're supporting an increase in the pay for the heroes of the pandemic, our aged-care workforce. Last week's Jobs and Skills Summit brought unions, employers and industry groups together to work out how we boost wages and deliver secure employment for Australian workers—the best way to tackle cost-of-living pressures. Our Powering Australia plan will invest in renewables, delivering cheaper power prices, lower emissions and more jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government, in just over 100 days, has taken more action than those opposite took in nearly a decade on cost-of-living pressures. We've extended the pandemic leave that was due to expire under the Liberals. We've introduced legislation that will drive investment in cleaner and cheaper energy, as I said. We're making sure enough gas stays in Australia for Australian households and businesses. We'll introduce legislation for cheaper child care for 1.26 million families. Our budget will cut the cost of medicines. We're fast-tracking fee-free TAFE places. In September, pensions, allowances and rent assistance will increase in line with inflation; that will see 4.7 million Australians receive a government payment increase. That is directly impacting 4.7 million Australians and their capacity to deal with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is astounding to be in this House, to be here today, and have those opposite raise these issues. A trillion dollars of debt and not enough to show for it, and they have the audacity to come into this chamber, first thing on a Monday morning, to talk about cost-of-living pressures that they did nothing—nothing—about for nine years. In fact, having been in this chamber for those nine years, I can hark back to that 2014 budget—that cruel, cruel budget that was introduced into this House. It was horrendous. It was driven back by the Australian people and by those on this side now, who worked so hard to make sure that people understood what that Medicare rebate freeze would mean and what the freeze to pensions would mean. Those on this side can walk in here proudly, with our heads held high, because we are getting on with the job; we are introducing the things that need to be done to ensure that Australians are better off, because that's why we exist: to ensure that Australians get a fair go—unlike those opposite, who are happy to see those vulnerable Australians suffer, year in and year out, most potently across the last nine years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  The first 100 days, and the key word I'm getting from my electorate is 'disappointment'—100 days of disappointment. In the first two weeks we sat in parliament, all we heard about was climate change and the Indigenous Voice to Parliament. The people in my electorate said: 'Are these really the priority of this new government? Here we are struggling to make ends meet, and they're talking about those issues.' All these issues have to be dealt with, of course, but it's about prioritising what is right. The people of Longman don't believe that climate change and the voice to parliament are the major issues that are facing our country at the moment. The fact is that the cost-of-living pressures and the homelessness issue in my electorate far outweigh those other issues that the government has been prioritising. The middle-class people in the suburbs of Australia feel abandoned by the Labor Party. It's as simple as that. Interest rates are killing people. Interest rates are going up and, therefore, mortgages are going up. So the investors who have to pay these mortgages have to raise the rents of the people who are renting. So their cost of living is going up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at what Labor's solutions are: 'Let's abolish the fuel excise and stick another 22c a litre on their fuel bill.' That's probably going to work out to be an extra $50 a week for the average Aussie. That's a great move; they can really afford that! Labor put up wages. But, unfortunately, the Labor Party are full of people who have never been in business, who have no concept of what that decision means. I was talking to a local baker, and I asked, 'How did you go with the pay rise?' He said, 'It was easy; I just cut 40 hours a week out of my wages bill. I laid a couple of casuals off, and the full-timers are going to pick it up.' Every employer wants to work or earn as much as they can. But, at the end of the day, they have a budget and, if their budget is $200,000 for wages, when you put up wages, all of a sudden, they don't have a bigger budget. In 35 years of small business, 22 years in ownership, I've never had someone walk in the next day and say, 'Hey, there was a pay rise yesterday; can I pay you a few more dollars?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The money is not endless. But, unfortunately, this is a concept that Labor never understands. The money just comes off a tree at the back of Parliament House, apparently, and you just keep pulling it off the tree. I always laugh about the 'trillion dollars of debt' comment. It is a joke, because we know that Labor were responsible for over half of that. Every person I talk to in my electorate is completely behind the fact that the government had to go to extraordinary measures during extraordinary times and were admired around the world for the way that they handled the pandemic and, in fact, were asked for advice by many countries around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I look at the electricity promise. We have a promise from the Prime Minister, saying, 'We're going to cut electricity prices to households by $275.' He's not going to come forward on this. There's a difference between a leader and a manager. We don't have a leader in this country; we have a manager who runs around putting out fires. He doesn't build firebreaks to prevent fires; he just runs around trying to put out fires. He's either misled or he is incompetent if he hasn't done due diligence. If he has made promises without knowing all the facts, as I say, he is either misled or he is incompetent. It's one of the two. Only a fool would come out and make promises without knowing all the facts. That again shows that this is not about delivering for the people; this is about winning votes at whatever cost—'It sounds good and, because it sounds good, I'm going say it.' Who isn't going to be happy about $275? But, when you don't deliver on it, that's not on. You've treated the Australian people like fools—and they will respond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian economy is a big business. That's all it is—a big business with big numbers. It concerns many people out there that we have running this country a party that is full of political career people who are from unions. I say, 'God help us all,' because the future will not be good under this government.</span>

This is an absolute treat, isn't it? It's a lovely start to a parliamentary fortnight, this motion from the Liberals congratulating themselves on their economic record. I mean, what a contribution to debate. I read it, and I did actually laugh out loud. I thought, 'Is this April Fools' Day?', and then I looked more closely and I thought: 'Oh, it's a new member. It's the member for Hughes. She's new here.' But she has a great advantage over most of us here; she has low expectations, because all she has to do is not be Craig Kelly and people are going to welcome her contributions and presence here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But really this motion is utter, total nonsense. If the Liberal or Morrison government's economic record is success then I would hate to see failure. I mean, seriously! A trillion dollars of Liberal debt—the previous speaker said, 'Well, it's not fair when they say that, because half of it was from Labor.' It wasn't. It actually wasn't. That is an untruth. He has a problem—a pattern of mendacity, if he keeps saying that, because I'm not allowed to call him a liar; I know that. The former government paid $20 billion of JobKeeper to companies to increase their profits. If you were big business, you'd be backing up the truck at the Treasury, thinking, 'Really? They're going to shovel it full of cash for the next generation to repay?'. What a bunch of stooges. Over a billion dollars they spent on taxpayer ads advertising themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mean, where were the rorted grants programs? Well, anything the National Party administered you can guarantee was rorted, all on the national debt for the next generation. Real wages fell in this country, and they can't hide behind COVID. That is the big lie they keep repeating, 'It was a tough time. We had to pour out the cash everywhere because of COVID.' It was 10 years of dysfunction and division. The OECD comparisons are clear: real wages went backwards for a decade even before COVID. Productivity was falling even before COVID—the worst productivity performance, over the decade they were in office, of the last 60 years that they've measured and recorded it. It is an appalling economic record: the highest inflation rate in 20 years; flatlining productivity, as I said; and a cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with some of the defences, excuses, the former Prime Minister gave. There are global factors in this. But there was also policy laziness at a domestic level. There were contributions because of what they did and what they failed to do that led to the mess that we've inherited now. Their response was always one of bandaids or sticky tape: throw a little bit of cash, make a silly announcement at a press conference and give it a cute program name. Remember JobMaker? That was the centrepiece a few budgets ago. We had good old Josh—what happened to him?—and Scott Morrison, now the member for Cook, I think we call him, standing up there going, 'We're going to create 450,000 jobs with JobMaker.' Well, 12 months on they'd created one per cent of what they said, and they quietly scrapped the program. It's all announcement. It was never about delivery and serious structural reform.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">cost of living and inflationary pressures are having a significant impact on Australian households and small businesses—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's genius, isn't it? It's like the Liberals discovered reality—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if they'd been the government for the last 10 years. Maybe they could have done something. The former Prime Minister's vision, remember, was snapback. After COVID we were just going to go back to how things were. It was all going so terribly well, wasn't it, with falling productivity, falling real wages and rising national debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor did not make the mess, but we are taking responsibility for fixing it. In the first hundred days we backed the minimum wage rise, which was approved by the Fair Work Commission, benefitting 2.8 million Australians. On climate change legislation, the previous speaker said, 'That's a waste of time. No-one cares about that.' Imagine supporting renewable energy, the cheapest form of new energy, to put downwards pressure on power prices? Imagine such a radical step?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But instead, the former government actively covered up—they actively covered up!—the power price rises which were coming from them. They know it; they don't like to talk about it. We could call it a lie, but we won't say that—will we, Deputy Speaker Freelander? There are 180,000 fee-free TAFE places coming on board this year and we're fixing the migration mess they left, with nearly a million visas backlogged right across the economy and families. It's hurting the economy and we're taking action to fix their mess.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A decade ago, I was lucky enough to live in Samoa. It was the most stunningly beautiful country, and everything about that place was vibrant. The landscape was lush, the ocean was made up of brilliant shades of blue and the sunsets felt like they were in technicolour—something I'd never experienced before. And the people, they were vibrant too: friendly and embracing—full-body laughs and outfits that were bright and loud. On special occasions, I still pull out my favourite pink-and-orange puletasi to wear. Besides Australia, it's one of my favourite places on earth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that country is under threat from climate change. When I was there a decade ago, climate change wasn't an existential threat: it was very real and it was very present. On this tiny island in the middle of the Pacific there were no climate change deniers, because the effects of climate change were being felt and seen every day. And it's gotten worse; if we do not act, Samoa will be wiped off the face of the earth. With the help of international assistance, the Samoan government has built sea walls to try to hold back the rising tide. Their efforts, while valiant, may have had some limited success in the short term but will ultimately prove to be futile. By 2030, the island's surrounding sea level will increase by up to 17 centimetres. Samoa and island nations in the Pacific are on the front line of climate change. Their pleas for action have gotten louder, and no-one can forget the image of Tuvalu's foreign minister, Simon Kofe, delivering his speech to the UN COP26 climate summit while standing knee-deep in seawater. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we are living the reality of climate change and sea-level rise, as you stand watching me today at COP26. We cannot wait for speeches, when the sea is rising around us all the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He wasn't engaging in melodrama he was engaging in reality, because Tuvalu is sinking, with 40 per cent of the atoll nation's capital already below sea level at high tide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel their palpable sense of loss now. I felt it more than a decade ago when I lived in Samoa, but I feel it even more acutely now. To our friends in the Pacific: we have not forgotten you. The Albanese Labor government is deeply committed to taking real and significant action on climate at home, and establishing Australia as a climate leader internationally. We recognise that climate change is the single-greatest threat to the security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific. We will listen to our Pacific partners as we stand, shoulder to shoulder, responding to this crisis, and we will deliver new climate finance for the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At COP26 we announced $2 billion in climate finance for 2022 and 2025, a doubling of Australia's previous pledge. This includes a commitment of $700 million to build climate-change and disaster resilience in the Pacific. Early visits by our foreign minister and minister for international development across the Pacific islands sends a clear message about the importance of our relationship with the Pacific. It's a relationship where Australia will listen, learn and work together to build a stronger Pacific family. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Samoa when they celebrated their 50th year of independence, in 2012, and I saw firsthand the pride Samoans had in their country. It was during the week-long festivities where I got to witness the celebratory exuberance of Samoans, and it was then that this island nation captured my heart and has held it ever since. This year marks the 60th anniversary of Samoa's independence. I hope we do everything we can to ensure that Samoans are able to celebrate their independence on home soil in another 10, 20 and 60 years to come. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I appreciate the member for Reid and her very personal story. I acknowledge what she said but do want to point out, at the outset, that the private member's motion states that it recognises the 'renewed engagement of the government in the Pacific' and so forth. The word renewed is interesting, offensive, as the former speaker says, because as the former government we did so much to help the Pacific—rightly so, deservedly so, justifiably. Let's not let the current government just wipe all over that and rewrite history. Let's not let the current government make out as if nothing was done, because if there is one important area in the world, right now, it is the Pacific, and the day of reckoning for this government is soon going to arrive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government accused us, when we were in government, of being there only for photo opportunities, and that was certainly not the case. But what we have seen over the past three months, in many cases, is just that—the photo-op, the media opportunity. What we are about to see is this government having to make important decisions about the Solomons and their controversial security agreement with Beijing, signed earlier this year, and what that means for visiting ships. Certainly, the Conflict islands and what the government's going to do about the ownership of those important islands, just east of Papua New Guinea—we haven't seen, thus far, anything coming from the government that suggests that any sort of decision is going to happen any time soon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government also needs to remember, and remember well, in its rhetoric, in its narrative, is that whenever there was a disaster in the Pacific—they're not all, let me tell you, due to climate change; certainly not. Whenever there was a natural calamity, it was Australia sending HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide</span>, or whatever ship, plane loads of fresh water, personnel, equipment and, most importantly, our defence people to help out those islands when they were in their hour of dire need. That's what we will continue to do as a responsible neighbour, as a responsible country. That's what Australia does. It rolls up its sleeves and it helps. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it worries me, sometimes, when we hear the narrative coming out of the mouths of the government members and ministers that nothing was done over the nine years of the former government. That is very disturbing, because we did a lot. As former Prime Minister Morrison told fellow G20 leaders on 26 March, 'Our Pacific island family must be a focus of international support. There has never been a more important time for Australia's Pacific step-up as we all face these massive challenges.' He was right then just as anybody is who says the same thing now, and they should. Australia's support for our Pacific island family must and has always gone far beyond climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, worryingly, what the current government hasn't actually stated is what is going to happen with this new 43 per cent target as to some of the infrastructure that needs to be, and is going to be, built in the Pacific. What happens when, let's say, a new runway is funded, partly helped by this government and partly helped by other good friends and neighbours? What effect might that potential infrastructure have on emissions into the future? Will it be built because of the new 43 per cent target? Will it be able to be constructed? Those are the questions that the government needs to answer. Those are the questions that people are starting to ask. Those are the questions that, indeed, our Pacific friends need to know the answers to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we did for the Pacific, apart from provide funding, was establish the Office of the Pacific in 2019 to support Australia's engagement with our valuable friends, to enhance whole-of-government coordination and to drive implementation of our regional activities. These were activities, I have to say, that went far beyond climate, far beyond the apocalypse that was described by the member for Reid. I too, like her, wish the Solomons and all the other countries all the very best as they celebrate all that is great about them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expire</span><span style="font-style:italic;">d)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I commend the member for Reid, who, at the request of the member for Jagajaga, has brought this motion before the House. Whilst advanced and wealthy countries argue about the realities of climate change, the changes they may have to make to their way of life and the costs that those changes may cause, developing countries of the world, such as Australia's near neighbours in the South Pacific, live with the greatest fear, the greatest cost and the least ability to defend themselves from what may happen in the future if the climate change trajectory continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People of the South Pacific have, for decades, been close friends and partners of Australia. They have relied on Australia in times of need and they have been allies and reciprocated whenever they could. Regrettably, over recent years—and particularly during the term of the last coalition government, contrary to the comments of the member for Riverina—Australia's relationship with our Pacific neighbours has deteriorated. They have been particularly disappointed in Australia's paltry response to climate change, which in turn signalled an indifference to the serious consequences that climate change predictions posed for their people, particularly those people living in the South Pacific. These are predictions that they take seriously and that they, understandably, cannot ignore. For them, the consequences could be catastrophic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If climate change projections continue, sea-level rises will very likely see much of their land disappear, while in the interim extreme weather events will cause massive destruction to what little infrastructure they already have. We are seeing that currently in Pakistan, with a third of that country under water and a humanitarian crisis that the world needs to respond to in order to help the people of Pakistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past five years, in both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, extreme weather events, including cyclones, hurricanes, floods, fires, extended droughts and changed climates, have caused the loss of thousands of lives and billions of dollars of destruction, and countless new weather records have been broken. In the Pacific region, sea-level rises of 30 centimetres have occurred since 1990 in some places, causing extensive coastal erosion, seepage of salty water into land areas, the loss of biodiversity and agricultural land and even the loss of housing. If current trends continue, by 2100, sea-level rises are predicted to reach between 0.6 metres and 1.3 metres. That level of rise would be catastrophic for many of the Pacific islands. Indeed, some of the Pacific atolls, I understand, have already disappeared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change problems in the Pacific will ultimately impact Australia as well. As a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, which was founded in 1971, Australia will be expected to respond, as it has in the past, with aid, resettlement, food, medicine and so on. It's not simply a matter where we say, 'Climate change might affect people elsewhere but our priority is here in Australia.' What happens elsewhere directly impacts on the people of Australia, and, in turn, on what we need to do to support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Australia is to regain the trust and confidence of its Pacific neighbours, we must take the threats of climate change seriously—in particular the threats to the people in the Pacific area. We must take them seriously by responding with meaningful mitigation policies. That's why the Albanese government's climate change legislation, currently before the Senate, is important. That legislation represents a credible response to climate change and its impacts throughout the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion highlights the importance that Australia, once again, rebuild its relationship with the Pacific island countries with whom we have worked together for so long—which, as I said earlier, deteriorated under the last coalition government. It's pleasing to see that the Albanese government recognises that and is trying to reshape the relationship with those islands.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  Some years ago, as a journalist, I covered Cyclone Pam, in Vanuatu. It was an experience that was very challenging, in a community that was devastated by an unusual storm. This is now happening in communities all over the world. Although this government has stepped further into the Pacific as a priority, I think it's important we note that much more needs to be done. It is a welcome development, particularly, that the foreign minister, Penny Wong, has recognised that renewed engagement in the Pacific is a priority; her first foray into the Pacific was an important signal of this fact. But my position is that we have ignored this region for far too long, and it will take long and consistent efforts to restore the confidence of those nearest neighbours. It's very easy to lose such confidence but much harder to restore it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many years ago, some will recall, we won plaudits for standing up to and opposing French nuclear testing in the Pacific and taking concrete steps to back up that opposition. But that was a long time ago. It should come as no surprise that, at a time of geopolitical fragility and uncertainty, the Pacific should once again be a cockpit of big-power rivalry. We left a vacuum, and big powers seek to fill that. As a middle power, but a middle power with an outsized role in the Pacific, we need to tread carefully, and we need to use our relations with our most important ally and our biggest trading partner to make sure the Pacific does not become the cockpit not merely of big-power competition but of conflict. We've played this role before, and we can do it again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Engagement, though, is one thing; actions are another. We've not yet done the one thing that the islands of the Pacific desire above everything else. This motion asks us to commend the many Pacific island countries that continue to be world leading in their commitment to addressing climate change. Yes, they deserve our commendation, but actions speak louder than words. They deserve the quality of actions on our part that will help minimise the real likelihood that some of these island nations will disappear beneath the waves as a result of climate change. Like us, they will suffer from extreme weather events and higher temperatures that will affect fishing grounds on whose resources many of them depend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, some years ago I was in Vanuatu after Cyclone Pam had hit the archipelago and caused untold devastation. Trees were stripped of leaves as if a bushfire had been through. Crops, like bananas, were flattened, houses were wrecked, and food and clean water were in short supply. Recovery from these events is slow. As they occur closer and closer together, recovery will become more and more challenging and expensive. Real climate action is needed and so is risk management and mitigation, as the impact of climate change has already been baked in for decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament took a significant step by entrenching climate change action in law, but we all know that a target of 43 per cent is not enough. It is not enough to ensure we keep global warming below an increase of two degrees, let alone 1.5 degrees. Drought in China, extreme heat in the EU and US, and floods in Pakistan show clearly that we do need to do more. What will be our response to the next disaster in our neighbourhood? How do we think the nations of the Pacific, our nearest neighbours—our family, as this nation calls the largely low-lying islands of Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia—think of us, given what we do, rather than what we say?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Less than two weeks ago, this government announced approval of nearly 47,000 kilometres for new offshore gas and oil exploration. As others have noted, the terms the minister used to justify this could easily have spilled from the mouth of her coalition predecessor: 'vital for the economy' and 'central to alleviating future domestic gas shortfalls'. Yet these sites would take years, if not decades, to go into production. The message this announcement sends to our Pacific friends is contradictory. We talk about our commitment to net zero, yet nothing has changed. The islands of the Pacific need us to do better. Thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  In a 2020 analysis by the Institute for Economics and Peace, we were told that by 2050 as many as 1.2 billion people in 31 countries could potentially be displaced by the climate crisis. Additionally, 5.4 billion people face extreme weather stress and 3.5 billion could face food insecurity. It's not an exaggeration to say that climate change is the most significant challenge humanity is yet to face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All around the world—just in the last few months—we've seen what extremes in climate can do. There have been fires in North America and last week Pakistan suffered devastating floods, killing more than a thousand people and displacing more, with waterborne diseases rife and many struggling to find food. I provide my condolences and thoughts to the residents of Werriwa whose families have been devastated by these events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None know the threat of climate change more than our neighbours in the Pacific islands, who have been urging the global community to take this crisis seriously. This is not a distant threat to them; this is a lived reality. Those in the Pacific islands have unfortunately experienced the worst of the effects of climate change: sea level rises affecting coastal infrastructure, more intense cyclones and droughts, crop failure and water shortages. Some Pacific islands are drowning. This is not a laughing matter and it creates stress for the people who are facing these crises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Biodiversity loss will be significant, with incredible, unique ecosystems being disrupted by the continuous onslaught of climate-change-related events. Unfortunately, the loss may be greater than estimated, as larger areas are unsurveyed. But we do know that the Pacific region holds three of the world's 35 biodiversity hot spots, and they will experience disproportionate effects of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Displacement is also a major current and future issue for our Pacific neighbours. With more coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, those who live there will have no choice but to move further inland or abroad. Kiribati and Tuvalu could become completely uninhabited within 50 years due to sea level rises. With over 2.3 million people estimated to be living in the Pacific region, this will cause extreme instability and a severe humanitarian crisis. This is a human and cultural catastrophe. Thousands of people will be left homeless, with many more becoming food and water insecure as climate change decimates already scarce resources in the region. With this displacement comes loss of cultural and indigenous knowledge. The loss is invaluable to both the people of the Pacific and the entire world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More specifically, our partners in the Pacific have been urging Australia to treat climate change like the threat that it is. Despite what we know of climate impacts in our region and in our country, they were met with silence by the previous government. When the government did respond, it did so with embarrassing climate targets that it didn't believe in and a policy of disengagement and denial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last 10 years of inaction saw Australia under the former government become a pariah on the global stage. We were out of touch with our closest allies in the Pacific as well as historical allies the US and the UK. The work that our government has done in three months to legislate our carbon emissions and work with all parts of the economy to reduce greenhouse gases has finally provided certainty. Remember: these targets are a floor, not a ceiling. We were at risk of isolating ourselves from our Pacific partners. We need to take climate change seriously. There is no role in the Pacific for an Australia that fails to listen to the issues that are affecting our shared region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been working to repair our relationship with neighbours, with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Penny Wong, initiating a series of meetings with the Pacific family. We know that, because of the disrespect that was shown over the last nine years, Australia must work hard to regain the trust of the Pacific island nations. With the climate crisis becoming more and more evident as we experience it firsthand, we must ensure our region is forging a path forward to a carbon neutral future. The whole world deserves a better outcome and for us to make sure that we look after them and understand their reasons and their concerns.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion. The member for Jagajaga's motion calls for the House to acknowledge the importance of Australia's role as a member of the Pacific family and recognises the reinvigorated engagement of the Australian government in this region, including through the significance of recent ministerial visits to the Pacific which have reiterated our shared priorities. Further, this motion recognises and applauds the numerous Pacific countries that have positioned themselves as world leaders in their commitment to addressing the growing challenge of climate change, noting its existential threat and potential consequences, including increased likelihood of extreme weather events; limited access to fresh water; changes to dominant industries, such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism; increased coastal erosion; inundation; and detrimental impacts upon biodiversity. This motion, therefore, welcomes the government's commitment to act on climate change to seek to protect further generations within Australia and abroad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges faced by our Pacific neighbours are significant and, without international support, may seem impossible. However, longstanding ties between Australia and the Pacific, evidenced through our cultural, social and economic connections, place us in a prime position to build upon our existing partnership and establish a genuine friendship founded on respect for our mutual pursuits. The threat posed by climate change in the Pacific is no longer speculative; it is imminent. In the nine years between 2011 and 2020, close to half of the people in the Pacific were impacted by a major disaster. In 2015, over 180,000 people in Vanuatu were affected by Cyclone Pam, and the following year Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston devastated Fiji.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I travelled to Vanuatu in the 2017-18 summer, hired a car and spent time around the other side of the main island, particularly the northern part of the main island, Efate, which was well away from resorts and tourist accommodation but was the area where Cyclone Pam certainly hit hardest. It was devastating to see that, years after Cyclone Pam, school halls and churches were still covered in tarpaulins—in fact, they were becoming threadbare—and the ring road was still washed away in so many places. I felt at that time that Australia was not doing enough to work with Vanuatu to rebuild and build back better, and I feel that for years we have largely forgotten or overlooked our Pacific neighbours and that we have not valued these relationships as we should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've visited Fiji many, many times. Outside of Mayo, it's probably the place in the world I feel most at home. And we can learn so much from the Pacific island nations. They are resourceful, and they care for each other in ways that I wished we cared for each other in Australia. Villages are tight-knit communities. They are welcoming and generous. They deeply value their elders. And family is everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pacific is facing the brunt of climate change. I therefore urge members to consider the potential consequences of inaction and the associated outcomes, with projections anticipating a thousand-fold increase in storm surges across this region by the end of this century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times, we've seen the ease with which international relationships can deteriorate, highlighting the importance of consistently fostering and valuing connections. As a member of the Pacific family, Australia must rise to this challenge and we must work with our neighbouring nations. This is not about working for them; it's about working with them. They are sovereign nations, and we must work in true partnership to ensure that these vibrant island communities have secure and prosperous futures.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I recall that in this place in March I reflected on the then government's Pacific step-up, and I actually termed it 'the Pacific stuff-up'. It was really a failure of the former government in positioning Australia as the partner of choice for our Pacific neighbours. The sheer incompetence, at every post, at every milestone, at every turn, when it came to managing our international relationships, was stark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, that period of ineptitude is over. Already, Prime Minister Albanese and Foreign Minister Wong have engaged significantly with our neighbours in the Pacific in the last few months. In doing so, they have re-established the foundation for engaging with our partners on substantive issues of mutual importance—issues like climate change, which represents an existential threat particularly to the Pacific, with the impacts likely to be more immediate and particularly severe in our region. Prime Minister Albanese joined Pacific leaders in July to declare that the Pacific is indeed facing a climate emergency that threatens the livelihood, security and wellbeing of its people and ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why one of the first pieces of legislation introduced by the Albanese government was to legislate ambitious emission-reduction targets to achieve net zero by 2050 and limit the global temperature increases that are threatening the existence of our Pacific neighbours, including shifting our national energy market to be made up of 82 per cent renewables by 2030, so rejoining our key partners—not just those in the region, but Canada, South Korea and Japan—in our ambition towards 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also committed to increasing official development assistance to the Pacific by $525 million over the next four years. This will include assistance for climate change adaptation and resilience programs. These programs will be developed, designed and implemented in consultation and partnership with our Pacific partners, because they don't need us to tell them how to do it; already they are at the forefront, globally, on adapting to the impacts of climate change and are indeed world-leading in their calls for greater commitments to address the climate crisis. These programs will form part of a Pacific climate infrastructure financing partnership, supporting the building of the infrastructure and clean energy sources that will make Pacific communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change. This is what true commitment to our Pacific partners is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government's engagement was marked by paternalism, disrespect and, frankly, condescension. For our government, it is about engaging with our Pacific neighbours as co-equals, as sovereign states, treating them with the respect that they deserve and ensuring that Australia remains their partner of choice for the region. The Albanese government continues to demonstrate Australia's commitment to this, across areas of shared priority with our partners, whether it be through the $5.6 million e-commerce fund that has helped over 850 small businesses across our region to participate in digital trade or our commitment of an extra $12 million a year for aerial surveillance to help combat the illegal fishing that threatens the region's fishing industry and costs Pacific island governments more than US$150 million in lost revenue. We will also deliver an Indo-Pacific broadcasting strategy that will provide funding for the ABC to boost Australian content to the Indo-Pacific region, expand regional transmission and train media partners. We will make improvements to our Pacific mobility scheme, such as allowing primary visa holders to bring their partners and children. We'll also boost permanent migration from Pacific countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up to 3,000 Pacific engagement visas would allow people from Pacific Island nations to move to Australia. All of this is real. All of it is substantive. All of it matters to our Pacific neighbours in ways that will make a real difference to their lives, to their nations. That's why this is real engagement. We understand the value of people-to-people exchange. We understand the value of cultural links not only for our mutual benefit but for the benefit of the entire region and for regional unity. Generations of migrants have shaped the modern Australian story, and our Pacific friends should continue to play an even larger part in that. We will welcome people from the Pacific Islands with open arms and give true meaning to that term 'Pacific family', and we will continue to deepen our ties and ensure Australia remains the partner of choice in the region.</span>

                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I inform the House that, more than two weeks ago, and while the House was not sitting, the honourable member for Melbourne raised a matter of privilege with me under standing order 52.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his correspondence, the member for Melbourne provided information and his reasons for requesting the urgent referral to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, as a matter of privilege or contempt, whether the member for Cook had deliberately misled the House by action or omission in causing himself, when he was Prime Minister, to be sworn in to multiple portfolios as an additional minister without informing the House. I responded to the member for Melbourne about the matters he raised, and I now also report to the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deliberately misleading the House is one of the matters that can be found to be a contempt. While claims that members have deliberately misled the House have been raised as matters of privilege or contempt on several occasions, no Speaker has referred such a matter, or given precedence to allow such a matter to be referred as of right, to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To establish that contempt has been committed through action or omission, it would need to be shown that (1) a definite action or omission had, in fact, been misleading; (2) the member knew at the time the action or omission was incorrect; and (3) the misleading had been deliberate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter of deliberately misleading the House is a serious one, and, rightly, there should be prima facie evidence that the House has been misled, and the misleading has been deliberate, in order for the Speaker to act under standing order 52 or 51. I have told the member for Melbourne that on the information available to me, it does not seem that a prima facie case has been made out in terms of the detail that Speakers have always required in relation to such allegations. It then follows that in accordance with the practice of the House, I did not refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, I understand the concerns of the member and other members about the matters he raised. While in accordance with the practice of the House precedence as of right to a motion for this matter to be referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests cannot be given, it's still open to the House itself to determine a course of action in relation to this matter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  Mr Speaker, thank you for welcoming me into this place. I feel blessed that I am able to stand here today in the 47th Parliament of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I begin I would like to acknowledge the Ngunnawal people, the traditional custodians of the Canberra region. I pay my respects to the elders past and emerging and to all of Australia's Indigenous peoples. I also wish to pay my respects to the Cabrogal people of the Dharug nation as the first inhabitants of the electorate of Fowler.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm humbled that my community has chosen me to represent them. It will be hard to express in words how grateful I am for this unbelievable opportunity and tremendous responsibility, but I will try. I never set out to be a politician. I only want to be a strong advocate for a community that has been neglected and abandoned by the major parties. I started that journey nearly 14 years ago today and I'm ready to make sure that the people of Fowler have their voices heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Fowler is named for Elizabeth Lilian Maud Fowler MBE, 1886 to 1954, for her contribution to local government and in recognition of her role as the first woman mayor in Australia in 1938. She was a trailblazer in local public service, a woman ahead of her time. As someone who comes from and deeply believes in local government, I couldn't be more proud to represent Fowler.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of my colleagues in this chamber will attest that one of Australia's greatest prime ministers, the Hon. Gough Whitlam, proudly represented the people of Fowler, as I do today. I'm sure he would have agreed that, while it is a privilege to represent the people of Fowler, we are not a privileged people. We are the forgotten people, and yet we are the backbone of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fowler is an amazingly rich area in culture, talent, people and landscape. We are one of the most culturally diverse electorates in the country. Our residents and families come from more than 130 different cultures around the world and have called Australia home. More than half the population, 52 per cent, were born overseas, and almost 70 per cent speak another language other than English. Nearly 10,000 refugees were resettled in our region, particularly in the Fairfield City Council area, between 2012 and 2017—more than any other city in Australia. Many come seeking opportunities, possibilities and freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a settlement city, and proudly so since the Second World War. But a settlement city has its own challenges. We have the third-highest unemployment rate in the country, at almost 10 per cent, which is about three times the national average of 3.5 per cent. Our median income is 20 per cent less than the rest of the nation. Almost 77 per cent of our population live in a family household and at least 20 per cent in a lone household. Forty-two per cent of our residents rent, compared to the New South Wales average of 32.6 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our low socioeconomic profile eclipses our resilience, grit and determination. Our people and our families play a critical role in elevating Australia's economy. We are the backbone of the New South Wales economy, if not the country's economy. This was evident during the COVID pandemic, when almost everything came to a halt because our tradies, truck drivers, retail workers, nurses, teachers and office workers were locked down. We weren't allowed to travel beyond the five-kilometre radius from our homes. We were told to get travel permits. We were forced to get tested every three days. We had helicopters flying around our area as well as police on horseback and men in uniforms knocking on people's doors. While the intention was good, we are a city made up of people who have fled tyrannical regimes and war zones, like my own home country. The last time I looked, a government that takes away an individual's liberty to choose how they want to live, work and raise a family was called a communist dictatorship, a political system that my family and I and many other refugees escaped from, especially the Vietnamese Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite what has been thrown at us from mainstream media over the years, despite the lack of investment in our great city and despite the lack of resources to make life better for our hardworking citizens, our people soldier on, placing their hopes and dream on their children to study well, to do well, to live well and to give back to the community. Not only are we the most resilient, embracing and courageous community, since COVID, we are the most vaccinated and the most tested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud to have grown up in this amazing place amongst these amazing people. I have witnessed its growing pains over the years and I am now witnessing its maturity as a cohesive, embracing and accepting multicultural community. Our Fowler electorate stretches from the wonderful Western Sydney Parklands, covering the suburbs of Abbotsbury, Edensor Park, Greenfield Park, St Johns Park, Prairiewood and Bossley Park—where the great Marconi club was born—to the west of the electorate, with families in the suburbs of Bonnyrigg, Mount Pritchard, Cabramatta, Canley Vale, Canley Heights, Fairfield East, Villawood, Carramar and Lansvale enjoying the diversity of cultural cuisines and religious places of worship as well as the Georges River, which connects it to the Chipping Norton Lake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many in the electorate of Fowler, mine is a refugee settlement story. I was seven years old when Saigon fell during the Vietnam War in April 1975. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mother was forced to flee with my two younger sisters, escaping communism. It was a time of chaos and confusion. I remember running with my mother and two younger sisters, scrambling to make our way onto a boat and pushing through the cries and screams of women and children. I had no idea what was happening. All I can recall are the cries, the panic, the chaos and the one moment on the boat when I turned around to look back at my birth country to try and comprehend what was happening and just saw a big black smoke in the distance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the moment when I thought we would die, when a huge storm hit our boat. I remember my sister Vi and I hanging on for dear life while my mother held my other sister tightly in her arms, praying with her rosary beads. I remember being soaking wet, lying under the tarp as the ocean hit us and the rain poured down. I remember how my face almost hit the ocean as our boat rocked so hard from the storm. And I remember my mother warning that I had to hold onto my sister and a plastic canister, just in case the boat tipped over, until we could find one another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trying to peer through the tarp, all I could hear was the storm, and I was terrified we wouldn't survive because none of us could swim. My mother kept praying, rosary beads in hand, as the boat continued to rock. The ocean was pitch-dark, and all I could think of was that I was going to fall into this black abyss. I kept praying in my heart that, should the boat tip over, I would still be able to hold onto my sister and find my mother. The storm subsided the next morning, but everyone was exhausted. I remember seeing bodies lying on the boat like dead corpses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the years in refugee camps, dreaming of being able to lie on a proper bed, to have a proper home and to go to a proper school. I remember the moment when we were accepted to be resettled as refugees in Australia, known to many back in refugee camps as the island with the best education system in the world, and I remember, as we stepped out of Kingsford Smith Airport, the feeling of gratitude and freedom. We were filled with hope as we looked out onto a horizon of endless possibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, you welcomed my mother and my family with open arms. You gave us comfort, food and a warm bed to sleep in. I will never forget the love shown to us by Aunty Claudia and Don Smith, who helped my family integrate into the community, and their children, Kylie, Maleea and Matthew, who kindly shared their books, clothes and toys with us. I know that Aunty Claudia is in the public gallery today with her daughter Kylie Williamson and Kylie's husband, Neale Williamson. I want to thank them for their kind and generous hearts, for being there for my mother and sisters as we struggled to rebuild our lives. There weren't any refugee or settlement services around to hold our hands back in those days. It was the kindness and support of people like Claudia and Don Smith and the St Vincent de Paul ladies society that helped us embrace the Australian culture and way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the Feras, who gave my mother her first job cleaning their house and helped us to get settled in. Mr Jim Fera has since passed, but his and his family's was a migrant story—from Italy, he came to Australia, worked hard to build his shoe business and later helped people like my mother. And I remember the Wards, of Scottish ancestry, who introduced me to anzac biscuits and made me feel like I belonged to this new country. This migration story belongs to all of us. It's our story, and we can all be proud to share it. I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute and acknowledge all of the Australian service men and women who fought for our freedom in Vietnam and who continue to serve us today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So after all that, how did I get to this place? I entered politics at the community level, fighting for a car park in Cabramatta in 2008, almost exactly 14 years ago to this day. I had just returned from a reporting trip with ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Correspondent</span> when I heard people at Cabramatta markets complaining about the decision by the then state member for Cabramatta to resign soon after she lost her health ministry. The chatter in the markets was that people had voted for her at every election and now she couldn't even deliver a car park for them. After hearing my outrage, my husband suggested I consider being a voice for the community. With no links to political parties or mainstream politics at all, the idea seemed daunting. How could I, a simple ABC reporter back then, do such a thing? I had no idea what was needed to be the voice of the community of Cabramatta. I'll be honest—it was scary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, people of diverse backgrounds, and in particular women of colour and those like me, did not feature in mainstream public life. I had no-one to turn to. I had no-one to mentor me nor to guide me on the journey I was about to take. But I took the leap of faith. I was so driven by the feeling of unfairness in how my community were treated as second-class citizens—the fact that my community weren't given a car park when they had been crying out for one for years, and that people had to pay 50c to use the toilet. I advocated strongly for the car park in 2008, which was delivered a few years after, following my election to the local council in 2012. I started my journey with one small step. As Lao Tzu said, a journey of a thousand miles begins with one small step.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the decision to go into mainstream politics was easy not because I knew anything about it; rather, it was because I knew nothing about it. At the December 2021 election, just last year, myself and the first Independent mayor, Frank Carbone, joined forces to run an Independent ticket for the election. While our team had managed a small win in 2016, it was a very slim win—250 votes. But last year we won the majority, with 10 of our 13 councillors elected. It was a very significant result, with the first popularly elected mayor with a 75 per cent margin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was against this background that we said something had to be done about the move to parachute in a woman, a former Premier, to be our voice in Fowler. We believed that it was time for one of us with lived experience, who'd grown up, worked, lived and spent most of our life in our community fighting and standing up for it—especially over the past couple of years during COVID and lockdown—to represent us. Conversations started among our small team: could we sit back and let our community be taken for granted again? The people of Fowler wanted and needed a representative who came from their community and who would never forget the personal challenges that they faced every day—who had walked in our shoes and been through what we had been through, not just at election time but every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a breast cancer survivor, I have experienced our amazing health system. I can say that in life-and-death situations our public health system is probably the best in the world. It saved me and my mother, who's had three open-heart surgeries. But often it can fail the many other ordinary Australians for simple treatments and services. We have two hospitals in Fowler: one that is heavily resourced, in Liverpool Hospital, and another that is hardly resourced at all, in Fairfield Hospital. In 2019 I campaigned for Fairfield to get funding in order to have wi-fi, because the hospital didn't have the electricity capacity to enable wi-fi. At the start of this year, while attending one of our amazing cultural events, the lunar new year, I was approached by two young women, who stopped to thank me for campaigning for the improvement to the hospital. They were both specialists and told me that because of my campaigning they were able to treat patients under the basement of the hospital, because it now had air-conditioning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As long as I'm in this House I will continually ask that both federal and state governments reassess health funding allocations so that they are equally distributed to our hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liverpool Hospital, despite the funding, is also overstretched because people and cases are pushed there. As a result, staff are underresourced and stressed and people are not seen on time and get frustrated because of the lack of care and service. This government can do more for families and communities like mine in Fowler. We need funding restored to Fairfield Hospital so that it can cater to the ageing and culturally diverse population and so that it doesn't put pressure on the Liverpool health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a large percentage of young people in Fowler. Many children of migrants and refugees are moving back into the area to be closer to their ageing parents and more affordable housing, for those who can afford it, and to set up businesses that will allow them the flexibility to spend more time with their families. Fowler has form in small business. There are 13,190 in our division, according to the recent ABS statistics. Small business makes up 98 per cent of all businesses in Fowler.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government recently announced the increase in migration places to 195,000 to assist with the skills shortage in Australia, I ask the government to first look locally to address the skills shortage because in my electorate of Fowler there's almost 10 per cent unemployment. I would also like to ask the government to look at the reason why we have skill shortages. I know of qualified people who were forced out of a job because of the vaccine mandate. We need to rethink this and include them back into the workforce. We must learn to live with COVID. We also have migrants and refugees with professional qualifications who are now working in underqualified occupations. We must work to safely create pathways for recognition of their qualifications so that we can engage their skills in our community. If we are to bring in more migrants, the government has the duty to ensure that there are immediate plans to build more housing, more public transport infrastructure and more local services to accommodate this planned increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community has seen the settlement of almost 10,000 refugees, with no additional funds to hospitals, schools, waste services, roads maintenance, traineeships or job opportunities. While it might sound and feel good to bring in more people, we must ensure that they are set up to succeed and to be included in communities and provided with housing, education and other opportunities. We cannot simply increase migration and then let these new migrants fend for themselves in a foreign country, leaving them feeling marginalised and demonised. It is the responsibility of government to ensure systems and plans are in place to enable a productive, cohesive and connected society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see the Fowler community prosper. We have people who are willing and ready to work. So we're looking to the future of technology and IT hubs in Fowler as part of the three-cities plan. We want to be the bridge between business and diverse communities to build wealth for our communities and our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our electorate has produced some of the best, diverse talent in Australia. In sports, we have Mark Bosnich, Steve Smith and Michael Clarke. In food, we have Luke and Pauline Nguyen, whose parents opened one of the first pho shops, a Vietnamese soup, in Cabramatta for the Vietnamese community. We have Angie Hong, the founder of Cabramatta's landmark restaurant <span style="font-style:italic;">Thanh Binh</span>, and her son, Dan, an Australian chef, restaurateur and television host of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Streets with Dan Hong</span> on SBS Food. In the creative space, we have the talented Maria Tran, the Asian-Australian woman who started a female action film movement that challenges gender stereotypes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must invest in our children. It's our job to plant the seeds of success today for a future Australia that we can all celebrate. I will work towards getting many of our local schools into permanent buildings. Nobody should have to go to school in demountables for years. Our education system should be ready technology-wise so that young children can tap into the future of work. Is our educational system fit for the future of work? My son is currently studying in second year at university, and he told me many students are given videos to watch as part of their lectures. There are hardly any student-lecturer interactions. Since COVID, many young people are finding that they're no longer connected to what's presented to them on a laptop. Young people must be supported as they struggle to study, to find work and to figure out their place in this fast-paced, social media driven world that we're now living in. Increasing traineeships, apprenticeships and internships will encourage and provide the platform and resources for our youth to be innovative so that they can add value to solving some of the world's problems. We need funding to build facilities that will care for our elderly, especially those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, who are often forgotten. We need to plan for equitable, accessible and affordable health services for those with special needs and for the vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm here to represent the families of Fowler, those who wake up early every morning, the working people—the people trying to juggle a mortgage and pay rent, work in a factory or run a family business, all while getting their young educated. I am their voice. We have often been misrepresented and misunderstood. But get to know us and you'll see we are more than a headline. We are so much more. I'm here to fight for resources, for facilities and for funds for my community. Fowler, you fought for me and stood up for me, and I will stand up for you so that our children will not be forgotten and overlooked. As long as I have the honour to represent the Fowler community in this House, you will hear me calling out for the funding we need for our children, for our education and health, and for local services that we deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my people—my community of Fowler—I wouldn't be standing here in this 47th Parliament without you. I'm here to serve you with integrity and transparency. I'm accountable to you. Know that I will fight for our rights to celebrate and promote the amazing cultural diversity that this country has afforded us. And I will also stand up to defend our freedom to express our different perspectives and thinking, and to share our ideas with respect for each other. No one human being can be, think and experience life like another, not even in a close-knit family. And know that, of the 151 members of parliament, we have achieved the most unique result. I can say with my hand on my heart that you, the people, delivered me. It was not any major parties, nor any funders. It's you, the community, and my family's mortgage!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, as well as the many people who have been on this mad journey with me for the past decade. I'm standing alone in this chamber today, but on my journey to this place I have been accompanied by many. I must thank all the people who have been with me on my journey for the past decade: Katrina Le, Sue Lee Lim, Ken Chapman, Julie Tagg, Geoff Davis, Charlie Lynn, Andrew Rohan, Charbel Saliba, Raymond Pham, Thomas Dang, Leonard Sii, Bailey Wang, Anna Duong, Son Brown, Wendy Chuyen and Gwen Riley. And to my current team at the council, Kevin Lam, Ugo Morvillo, Reni Barkho and Milovan Karajic: while we only met in recent years, you have given 150 per cent at each election since we met. And the same to these community members: Ninos Younan, Tiglat Rommel, Monica Falco, Julianna Falco, Bao Nguyen, Thy Ha, Samantha Bun, Julie Dang, Michael Mijatovic, Linh Podetti, Jennifer Cao, Jacqui Ashley, Anderson Chen, Pat Sergi, Lytha and Holly Khorn, Laith Alchino, Samir Yousif, Immanuel Sada, Adem Cetinay and Sinilia Radivojevic. And to the numerous volunteers who travelled from all across Australia to support our campaign, I offer a huge and heartfelt thankyou.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics is a lonely journey, as many of you in this chamber would attest. Someone can be your closest ally one minute and your enemy the next. It changes like the flick of a switch. Finding someone to trust and work through the political labyrinth with is not easy. There are trials and errors. I'm lucky to have found a great and trusted team in my councillor colleagues, but there's one person who has been on that political journey with me, fighting the enemies as well as delivering for the community since we got on council: my council colleague, the Mayor of Fairfield City, Frank Carbone. Mr Carbone's endorsement of me to the community at the May 2022 election played a key role in my success in Fowler. He has the support of many in our city and region. Thank you, Frank!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my family—my sisters Vi Le, Thuy Vi Le and Jaycie Le, and to my mother, who all never, ever doubted me and have always been there for me—I'm sorry I've been an absent sister and daughter. To my sister Vi and her husband, Alan Morris, in particular: you've always been there, willing to help, whenever I reach out, without complaint or criticism. Thank you for your unconditional support, understanding and kindness, and for standing by me throughout my political journey since I began in 2008.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, and certainly not least, to my beautiful and loving family—the most important of all, my darling son, Ethan Lambert. Ethan started to campaign when he was about five years old, and at every election he was there to help hand out his mother's house-to-vote cards. I love you to the moon and back! Thank you for allowing me to work for the community without demands and judgement. The same goes for my loving and supportive husband, Markus Lambert. 'Thank you' is not enough for all that you have done to enable me to pursue my public life and to be of service to the people of Fowler. I am grateful that you have been willing to put up our personal finances and took huge risks to enable me to reach this milestone. I know you have made huge personal sacrifices for the greater good of the community. The almost-weekly and weeknight functions that I have to attend mean that you had to make your own dinner and look after the house and the family, which includes our two dogs, Bella and Clancy. I'm grateful for your unwavering and unconditional support. Thank you for believing in me, thank you for letting me be me; for igniting my passion and never, ever trying to dim my light. I love you both so much!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I began my journey in this place in the same way I began my life in public service: with hope, with passion and with relentless commitment to do what is right for the people who live in the electorate of Fowler. The people of Fowler are my people. Our story belongs to every Australian. Mr Speaker, thank you for your time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and congratulations on your election as Speaker. Your energy, your kindness and the tone you have set will help our parliament be dignified and respectful. I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Ngunnawal people, and also of the lands of the Cunningham electorate, the Wodi Wodi people of the Dharawal nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is a significant day for the Illawarra. It is the day that the late Fred Moore would have turned 100. Fred was a fierce local unionist, activist, teacher, mentor, feminist, miner, musician, boxer, husband, father, grandfather and honorary elder of the Jerrinja tribe. He cared about people, social justice and equality. A foundation member of the Illawarra Aboriginal Advancement League, Fred would be so proud that we are enacting the Uluru Statement from the Heart and moving quickly to create an Indigenous voice to parliament. One of Fred's five daughters, Sue, who is here with us today, said to me when I was preparing this speech, 'You have the right principles and sense of social justice; you can't go wrong with that.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In paying tribute to Fred Moore, I gratefully acknowledge the work over many years of union members and leaders in the Illawarra. Their activism has led directly to changes in policy in response to industrial accidents like the 1887 Bulli mine disaster and the 1902 Mount Kembla mine disaster, battles like the Dalfram dispute in 1938 and the campaign by migrant women to work at the BHP steelworks in the 1980s known as the 'Women of Steel dispute'. I thank Robynne Murphy for her support and for telling the story of these women through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Women of Steel</span> documentary. These events shaped our community and our workplaces, contributing to the Illawarra's unique character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank wholeheartedly my good friends in the Illawarra union movement for their support and friendship over the years: Arthur Rorris and Tina Smith, from the South Coast Labour Council; Rob Pirc and Brad Gibson, from the TWU; Tara Koot and Ellen McNally, from the ETU; Paul Farrow, Chris Newbold, Joe Hutchings and Laurie Gripton, from the AWU; Rudi Oppitz and Mick Jones, from the USU; Bob Timbs and Andy Davey, from the United Mine Workers Union; Mick Cross and Mich-Elle Myers, from the MUA; Rob Long and Lorraine Watson, from the TAFE Teachers Association; Duncan McDonald, Henry Rajendra, Maurie Mulheron and Angelo Gavrietalos, from the Teachers Federation; Anne Knight, from the SDA; Chris Christodoulou, formerly of Unions NSW and now CEO of Greenacres disability care; and my very good friend Narelle Clay, president of the ASU and CEO of Southern Youth and Family Services, and her amazing team at SYFS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank Gerard Hayes, Adam Hall, Lynne Russell, Lauren Hutchins, Meri Bosevski and Renee Sheridan, from the HSU, for their tireless support of our local aged-care workers, allied health staff and paramedics. It has been a privilege working with you to develop Labor's aged-care policies—policies we are now implementing due to the hard work of previous shadow minister Clare O'Neil and our new minister, Anika Wells. I would also like to thank Andrew Dettmer and Ian Curry, from the AMWU; Mark Burgess, formerly of the ETU; and Brad Parker, from Mates in Construction, for their friendship and sharing their knowledge of apprentice policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mum, Petronella—or Pem, as she is known to everyone—has a familiar story of the Illawarra. She migrated from Holland when she was in primary school, starting her life at the Scheyville Migrant Centre before moving to Bondi, where her parents operated a delicatessen, and then on to Coalcliff seven years later. I grew up in Woonona, a typical Australian suburb, and I went to Woonona Public School and Woonona High School. We grew up in a house that my late father, Ron, was converting from three old flats. Like painting the Harbour Bridge, it was an ongoing project. For much of my childhood we had no proper flooring and no plaster on the walls, and electricity switches hung out of the walls—Dad was a sparky. Dad worked in the mines and was in and out of work, a common experience as the Illawarra suffered the harsh economic winds that blew through coal and steelmaking in the 1980s. Mum and dad often struggled to keep our home, and mum would try to convince us that lambs fry was steak when stretching the family budget—not terribly well!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At times it was really tough, and it's an experience you don't forget. It is why, throughout my working life, I have stood up and helped workers and vulnerable people. Worrying about the future of your job, paying the mortgage and putting food on the table can become overwhelming. I will always work for more jobs and investment in the Illawarra. I want people to be secure in their work and able to take up opportunities as they arise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dad dreamed big. He loved innovation and new technology. When he could afford it, he was an early adopter. Sometimes he got it right. We were one of the first houses in Woonona to have solar panels, in the 1980s, and we had an Apple IIe computer. Sometimes he missed the mark, like choosing Beta over VHS! He argued passionately that Beta was technically superior. Many hits, with the occasional miss: it's the story of human progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My formative years were a mix of school, surf, sun, work at McDonald's and some standard teenage rebellion. In reflecting on my upbringing, I couldn't help thinking of <span style="font-style:italic;">Puberty Blues</span>, by great Australian author Kathy Lette. It was a coming-of-age story, and I saw myself in it. I could never understand why as a young woman I was encouraged to do sewing and home economics, why when I came first in computer studies in years 9 and 10 the boys I beat were still lauded as computer geniuses. We girls could never understand why we had to wear scungies for school sport, effectively running around in a T-shirt and underwear. When confronted with leaking lights, we organised and forced teachers to teach us outside. We drew attention to the problem and worked together to get it fixed in what would now be described as student activism. At the time, we didn't have a label for it. We were simply looking for fairness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The determination for a better deal and fairness are things I have pursued throughout my life. I am not willing to see people treated poorly just because they are vulnerable. Socially, my experience was relatively smooth, but not all of my classmates could say the same. I watched the struggles of three of my friends who were gay and could never dream of coming out in high school. Thankfully, we have made progress. They are all now out and proud and living their best lives. They include Daniel Mahe. He and his partner, Patrick, are here in the gallery today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Others in this place typically left school to go to university. I left school early in year 11. My parents were clear, though: leaving meant going into training or getting a job. I did a business administration course and got my first full-time job as the accountant's assistant for New South Wales Labor. After a year and a half of commuting to Sydney, I was fortunate to obtain a job as an electorate officer with the then federal member for Macarthur, Professor the Hon. Stephen Martin AO. Stephen went on to represent Cunningham, and I also acknowledge Stephen's predecessor in Cunningham, my friend Stewart West, and his wife, Mary Paris. It was in Stephen's office that I learned the importance of good local representation, and I thank him for the opportunities he gave me. They led me here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also where I learnt the importance of punctuality, a good work ethic and fixing problems. It's been said that I'm like a dog with a bone when it comes to fixing people's problems—sometimes as a compliment, sometimes not! It was that determination which equipped me for the role, being willing to advocate hard for people who needed help from government. Constituents are often angry, distressed or both when they approach their local MP for help because they have been let down by the system. If people come to me for help or advocacy, they get it in spades. For example, my good friend Professor Justin Yerbury AO, a recent Eureka Prize recipient for his MND research, and his amazing wife, Dr Rachel Yerbury, have fought so many exhausting battles to get access to decent services and support for Justin, who has motor neurone disease and is manually ventilated and in a wheelchair. These were fights they should not have been forced to have. Or there are Susan, Mark and Sophie Wallis, who I met with their gorgeous Gracie—forceful advocates for a better deal for people with a disability. It has been a privilege to advocate for you. I share your stories to demonstrate our need to fix the system so people can concentrate on caring for loved ones, not bureaucratic battles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will work hard to improve the NDIS to make it work for Australians with disability. Minister Bill Shorten has already started this work. I will work hard to implement our reforms to aged care to provide better care for older Australians. I will work hard to improve access to primary health care with an Illawarra Medicare Urgent Care Clinic. It will give people a bulk-billed service and help reduce waiting times at Wollongong Hospital ED. I will work to implement our housing policies so that more people have a roof over their head. My motto as a staffer was always: apologise for the failure of the system; empathise and act, but never overpromise. As my close friend Chris Lacey says, 'Be a good human, know your stuff and get good stuff done.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past 17 years, I worked for Sharon Bird in her electorate and ministerial offices. Sharon is one of the most phenomenal people I know. She cares about people, cares about her community and has a unique way of bringing people together. My approach will also be working to bring people together. I thank Sharon for her support and encouragement and for being one of my best mates. She hated it when I called her my boss. The opportunity she provided also led me here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank my former colleague and mate of 30 years Gino Mandarino. Gino is a strong supporter of women, pushing us to do better, aim higher and not take rubbish from people. Your friendship and support are valued and appreciated. I also thank Sharon and Gino's grandchildren, Anton and Sienna, two of my youngest supporters. Gino and my husband, Paul Scully, are my toughest critics but also my strongest supporters, a powerful mix. I have known Scully for 30 years. We grew up in Young Labor together and were great mates before we fell in love in 2004 and married in Las Vegas in 2008. I'm sure I'm going to regret saying this, but Scully is one of the smartest, most caring and passionate people I know! He both infuriates me and inspires me, sometimes simultaneously. He is also my best mate, and I am pleased we will work together with our community to help set up our region for the decades ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, my very long list of thankyous. As Hillary Clinton said, it does take a village. Firstly, the people I have called on for support daily over the past year and shared adventures with prior to that: Kathryn Conroy, loyal, fun, smart and one of my best mates. I am so very grateful for your advice and friendship. You, your sister, Paula, and your mum, Margarete—or Mrs C—make a very formidable family of strong women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Richard Brooks and Nelson Tang—Nelson, like Madonna or Kylie, needs only one name, as everyone knows Nelson—I appreciate your very frank advice, particularly from Richard, who is never shy with his opinion. You are my two fiercest fashion critics but also two great mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Thomas and Libby Moorhead: your friendship and support over many years is so very much appreciated and cemented over problem-solving with bubbles and burgers. I thank Thomas for fighting with me for better pay and conditions for staff and for helping me set up my office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Mitch O'Dwyer and Caitlin Roodenrys, my campaign director, field director and great friends: thank you so much for your time, your kindness, your advice and your support. A huge thankyou to Monika, Marta and Ellen for giving up your husband and dad to help me and for bringing the fun to the campaign meetings. Caitlin is a fearless young woman with strong ethics and has a great future in front of her.</span>

I especially thank my new office team: Chris Bird, Frances Kerkham, Idalina Guerreiro, Callum Bain, Hanaa El-Bashir and Cheyne Howard. I'm forever grateful to you for all of your work in setting up the office and the long hours and commitment you are already devoting to our constituents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank my local parliamentary colleagues and their teams who stood on pre-poll and street stalls with me: Stephen Jones; Fiona Phillips; Ryan Park, whose wife, Kara, and son, Preston, are here today; Tania Brown; Janice Kershaw; Richard Martin; David Brown; Ann Martin; and Linda Campbell. Thank you also to Bianca Goncalves and Adam Devereaux for your friendship, support and encouragement. Bianca has been my best mate since primary school, where we were known as 'the shadows' as we were rarely apart. Thank you to Kiley Martin for being another best mate over so many years. Kiley is another provider of full and frank advice. I seem to have quite a few of those in my life!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A huge thankyou to our local branch members and the mighty Illawarra Young Labor. You phone banked, and you stood in shocking weather on street stalls, pre-poll and that rainy, cold election day. There are too many of you to name individually—many of you are in the gallery today—but you and I know who you are, and I'm forever grateful to you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few who have provided strong friendship and support over many years and have campaigned with me almost daily, including Nick and Judy Whitlam, Lynne Fairey, Ian Turton, Jim Allen, Paul and Kay Tuckerman, Bob and Ann Bower, Bev and Kev Reed, Neil Barnett, David Campbell, Michael Meurer, Kristen Wall, Carol Martin, Tim Coombs, Elizabeth Osbourne, Graham Kahabka, Chris Lacey, Kerryn Stephens, Naomi Arrowsmith, Ron Watt, Blake Osmond, Elisa Delpiano, Therese Smith, Tom Ward, Bill and Michele Stephens, and Michael and Norma Wilson. And I would particularly acknowledge two of my favourite branch members: Annie Wilcox and her great mate Stella Chapman.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank local oncologist and champion for local cancer services Professor Phil Clingan and his wife, Margaret, for their strong support. Also thanks to Fay Campbell and Michele Saunders, whose fight for our hospitals reminds us all about the true nature of care. These champions work hard to try and stop people being taken by cancer too young, like my good friends Toni Neuman, Campbel Giles and Louise Biggs were.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my friends at Bellambi Surf Club, including Craig Kershaw, John Hobbs and Tara Robertson; Paul Boultwood, from Corrimal Chamber of Commerce; Renay, Bruce and the whole Horton team from All Occasions Flowers; Kevin Crane and Nat Smith from Broken Glass Hair; Kylie Montgomery from One Cake Down; Wayne and Jane Henderson from Tonnito's Cakes; and Ash and Charlie from Port Beirut for their strong support as well. And I can't forget the support provided by my long-time friends Michael Crowe, Bec Lea and their children Tara and Ewan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank some of my colleagues who gave me advice and support over many years. Julia Gillard has been a friend and an inspiration. I will never forget her leadership advice and kind messages of support. And I am thrilled that Anthony Albanese, who I have worked with during my entire time in the Labor Party, has become our Prime Minister. Like me, he doesn't forget where he comes from or the life experiences that have instilled the values he brings to the prime ministership. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank former members Chris Hayes and his wife, Bernadette, Gai Brodtmann, Wayne Swan, Laurie Brereton, Leo McLeay, Peter Garrett, Craig Emerson and Tracey Winters, and Laurie Ferguson and his wife, Maureen. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank friends from the New South Wales parliament: Anoulack Chanthivong and his wife, Anna, and children Audrey and Christopher; Aaron Rule; Greg Warren; Lynda Voltz; Trish Doyle; and Yasmin Catley. I also thank former senator Kim Carr and his fabulous staff who taught me so much with a lot of fun along the way. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith, Emily Forrest, Fiona Scott, John Byron, John Angley, Gary Moorhead, Christopher Anderson, Ray Cassin and Ellie Hughes, and also Fiona Bastian and Sam Cardwell and their supercool son Hamish Cardwell. And there's another special shout-out to Justine Elliot and Team Tweed—Craig, Alex and Joe Elliot, Kylie Rose, Reece Byrnes and Gerry Ambrosine. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank my family—my mum, Pem, and late father, Ron. Unfortunately, mum is not in the gallery today but she is watching at home—thank you for your love and support. I also thank my brother Colin, Karen, Kimberley and Caelan, and my in laws, Inta and Ian, Jane, Boyd, Annabelle and Max, and Glen, Rosie and Timothy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A special thank you to my aunt Edith and cousins Leah Marley and Laura-Jean Gulley, and campaign dog Fabian. Leah has travelled from America to be here today. Edith and I are early risers and our early morning chats are very much appreciated. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I absolutely loved my career as a staffer—all 29 years and 11 months of it. I was proud to represent staff as a USU delegate and staff representative. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank USU secretary Graeme Kelly for his support in helping the amazing staff here in the parliament. I have been overwhelmed by the messages of support, good wishes and volunteers from hundreds of current and former colleagues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was suggested to me that it would be easier to table this list, but, given the contribution these talented, kind, hardworking and fun people have made to this place, our community and our country, they deserve to be acknowledged and thanked individually: Angie, Michael and Riley Sidonio; Andrew 'Bigtop' 'Topper' Moore; Cora Trevarthen; Andrew Reeves; Ben Rillo; Tania Drewer; Lou Cullen; Bernie Shaw; Christina Valentine; Nimfa Farrell; Koula Alexiadas; Andrew Downes; Owen Torpy; Laura Ryan; Odette Visser and her husband, Andrew Greene; Michelle Fitzgerald; Vicki Fitzgerald; Shannon Threlfall-Clarke; Ryan Liddell; Ann Clark; Denise Spinks; Debra Biggs; Drew Eppelstun; Hayden Gray; Sav Chirumbolo; Liz Bateson; Maree Edwards; Erin Smith; Kylie Jenkins; Anna George; Nina Gerace; Barb Pini; Jennilyn Mann; Samantha Miles; Theresa Lane; Kim Pagan; James Bartlett; Nicole Duffy; Adam Boidin; Mitch Wright; Arley Black; Jennifer Light; Todd Pinkerton; Chris Fry; Meredith Horne; Georgie Slater; Zach Alexopoulos; Brydon Toner; Bryce Wilson; Nick Melas and Poppy Melas; David Voltz; Jane Shelton; Justin Lee; Vicki Meadows and Anthony Cawthorne; Gai Coglan and Greg Sweeney; Simon Zulian; Rose Tracey; Jeff Singleton; Alex Sanchez; Phoebe Drake; Jarrod Dellapina; Simon Tatz and Amanda Bresnan; Matt and Elsie Ryan; Jim Middleton; Darrin Barnett; Leigh Heaney; Katana Smith; Polo Guilbert-Wright; Ross Neilson; Dave Britton—I'm nearly there!—Jamie Snashell; Simon Banks; Chris and Antony Brereton; Helen Nezeritis; Kirsten Andrews; Brett Gale; Korena Flanagan; Sarah Michaels; Amber Setchell; Prue Mercer; Sandra Webber; Dimity Paul; Trish Marinozzi; Chris Parkin; Darren Rudd; Jenelle, Rod, Jordan and Cameron Rimmer; Mel and Nick Haskew; BJ Roberts; Dionne Garcia; and Donna Tetley; as well as Tate, Tahlea-Rose and baby Oliver; and Gail Morgan, Jason Smart and Amelia Cossey. I was with Amelia's parents on the night she was born and have watched her grow into a gorgeous, smart and sassy young lady. Her mum and I are both terrified and excited to see what her future holds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come a long way since I started here in the 1990s. Staff are having their voices heard—particularly female staff. I am confident that, under Prime Minister Albanese, Special Minister of State Don Farrell and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Gartrell, this will continue to improve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years I have advocated passionately to get outcomes for people. I care about people. I care about their jobs. I care about our environment. And I promise to work hard to kick goals for our community. I will never let the Illawarra be ignored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community is suffering from nearly 10 years of a government that gave up on us. It left us in a terrible state, with debt, inflation and stagnant wages, having failed people and ignored action on climate change. Addressing the gender pay gap and women's workforce participation were reduced to a talking point—if that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To much relief, the election of the Albanese Labor government has ended that sad era. We pushed for a pay rise for low-paid workers. We'll put humanity back into aged and disability care and train Australians for the jobs of the future. And I'll make sure the Illawarra gets its fair share. I support action on climate change, structured to create jobs while reducing emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Illawarra has long been a place of steel, mining and heavy industry. Our deepwater port and world-class university provide enviable connections to the globe. We stand ready to be leaders in achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We stand ready to use our skills to produce high-quality steel in a more sustainable way. It will be used to build the renewable energy and transmission infrastructure we need to power homes and industries. The government's early actions to rebuild Australia's global reputation send clear signals to business and industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wollongong community, business and union leaders understand the importance of workers and businesses having the skills for the modern economy. We have a skills crisis in renewable energy. Three in four solar companies struggle to recruit electricians. Experience in renewables is the main obstacle. Wollongong can play a major role in supplying that highly skilled workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To support this aspiration and build workforce and small-business capacity, I have secured an Energy Futures Skills Centre for the University of Wollongong and a renewable energy training centre for Wollongong TAFE. They will cooperate to put the Illawarra front and centre of our cleaner economy and jobs future. I thank the University of Wollongong vice-chancellor, Patricia Davidson; Canio Fierravanti; Ty Christopher; and the executive director of Business Illawarra, Adam Zarth, for their help and advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank Stephen Ferguson from the Australian Hotels Association. He recently came to Wollongong and met with Ryan and Nikki Aitchison from the Illawarra Hotel and saw some of the amazing things our local businesses are doing to repair the environment. They have just employed a sustainability officer at the pub.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to focus on education—from early childhood education to primary and high schools, TAFE and universities. As I said earlier, my educational path was not the traditional one. After a sizeable gap, and with the encouragement of my friends at the university, I completed a master's degree. It was daunting, but I am the better for it and proof that education is a lifelong project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My commitment is to deliver for our region. I have secured a community battery for Warrawong, a community with low household incomes, allowing those who cannot afford to invest in their own solar panels to share in the benefit. I have fought for our area to become one of six potential offshore wind generation zones, which can help make Wollongong a jobs powerhouse, providing opportunities and further investment. I thank Minister Chris Bowen and his team, including Andrew Garrett and Tom Skladzien, who are setting a cracking pace to get our grid to 82 per cent renewables by 2030. The Illawarra is innovative, tough and clever, and I am optimistic about what we will achieve. Combining renewable energy training centres and our manufacturing skills with offshore wind generation prepares our region to be a centre of energy and economic innovation—a place which attracts, trains and retains the brightest minds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have often been asked why I wanted to enter parliament. People thought, having worked here and seen some of the worst elements, I might be turned off. But it is for that very reason that I am here—because we can and should do better, much better. Australians don't expect us to agree all the time, but they do expect us to get on with the job of being decent people and achieving good outcomes. I do not shy away from my history as a staffer or from the things that made me the determined person I am today. Together we can provide better opportunities for workers and their families. We can do so in a way where economic and environmental sustainability are at the heart of our actions and in a way that makes sure people are not left behind. We can elevate our influence on the world stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wollongong has changed since I was born, but our community values endure like hardened steel. They are founded on the need to trust your mates in dangerous workplaces, to understand your neighbour who was born in a different part of the world and to know that fairness should guide decision-making. To continue this, to fix it, to build on it, to harness it and to grow it are the reasons I sought election. When I was elected, my good friends Luke and Renee Toy sent me a quote from President John F Kennedy's inaugural speech. I cannot think of a better way of ending my first contribution: 'But let us begin.' I thank the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land upon which we meet today, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, and pay respects to elders past, present and emerging. First Nations people have cared for our precious land and waters for over 60,000 years. I'm proud to be part of an Australian government that knows that it is vital for healing and respect that we recognise First Nations people in our Constitution and implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart, that's working to deliver voice, treaty and truth. I also acknowledge the Bunurong and Wurundjeri people, who are the traditional owners of the beautiful land and waters in my electorate of Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are in this chamber, we must always remember that we sit here not merely as individuals; we are here as proxies for our communities, to carry the torch for our communities, to champion our communities. We carry the hopes and the fears of our electorates into this place and are charged with ensuring that those fears are eased and those hopes are pursued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand now in this chamber with the hopes and the fears of my community firmly in my mind. I think of Pat and John, who I met just near the Wattle Park shops and who invited me to sit with them on the sun-drenched deck at the back of their house on a beautiful autumn morning. They shared with me their fears for the future of their grandchildren if we do not act on climate change, if we do not do more to make our democratic systems accountable and make parliamentarians act with integrity. I am here because I want to give Pat and John, their grandchildren and everyone in my community hope that an Australian government will act to ensure the wellbeing of our planet and will restore faith in politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand in this chamber and think of Roger, a proud Australian of Chinese heritage, who worries that communities across the country have become divided, who is passionate about the need to ensure that everyone, no matter where they may have been born or their ancestors came from, is embraced and included in Australian society. I stand in this chamber to assure Roger that diversity is our nation's greatest strength, and I am proud of the rich multiculturalism in Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time spent in my community is time spent celebrating the contributions of the people who have made modern Australia and their cultures. The triumph of multiculturalism, of enterprise, of community is evident in our suburbs when tasting Chinese cuisine in Box Hill, shopping for spices at Sri Lankan grocery stores near Syndal Station, playing cricket in the park with local Indian families in Burwood and enjoying the bountiful supply of zucchinis and figs from Italian and Greek neighbours in Clayton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand in this chamber and think of Angie, an 11-year-old girl from Mount Waverley, whose hope encouraged me. I remember, on a particularly long day in the middle of the campaign, opening a letter with neat, careful handwriting that read: 'I just wanted to say that I support you on your journey of good in this world. Even though I can't vote because I'm too young, can I help and support you?' It was signed, 'Angela, your supporter and proud young feminist.' Angie's letter was one of hope for the future, of a nation and a world that is more equal. Angie's words gave me encouragement when I needed it. Her optimism and her spirit will stay with me for as long as I am in this place, and I will strive every day to ensure her hope for a better future is realised through actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We come into this place because of the path that was laid in front of us by those who have come before us. My ancestors arrived in this country to seek a better life for themselves and their families. On my father's side, they came to Victoria in the 19th century, and I am proud of their contributions to civic life and my own. On delicate, ageing paper in the archives in my home state, the names of my ancestors can be found on the petition from 1891 to grant Victorian women the right to vote. I'm honoured to be a descendant of Mary and Edith Garland of North Melbourne, who joined with almost 30,000 others to petition the parliament that women should vote on equal terms with men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An oft-quoted suffragist maxim is: courage calls to courage everywhere, and it is the courage of my forebears to forge change and foster equality that I draw courage from to leave a legacy for those who will come after me. More recently, my mother's family left an Italy brutalised by war for the hope of a better life promised by Australia. They worked hard jobs at a time when Australia was a markedly less multicultural place than it is now, contributing to the post-war reconstruction of our nation as they strove to settle in a strange place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My nonno loved philosophy and politics. He loved opera, and his talents were considerable. He aspired to use them. It was not until Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister that he was able to when educational opportunities became accessible. He became a much-loved maths teacher at Emmaus in Burwood in my electorate, and this transformed his life, his family's life, my life. This story will be familiar to those who share the postwar migration journey, who experienced the transformation of hope into real opportunity from a Labor government. I want everyone in my community to be supported by their government to pursue their aspirations, just like my own family was. I will always look to open doors, to extend opportunity to my community, so that every single person is able to follow the ambitions they hold for themselves and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate was named for Caroline Chisholm, a remarkable figure who through the 19th century improved the lives of so many in the fledgling European settlements in Australia, especially through her support of women and girls as they forged new lives for themselves in this country. Caroline Chisholm was known as the immigrants' friend, and it is fitting that the electorate which is named for her is home to people who have recent connections to the migrant journey to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been said that Caroline Chisholm's favourite axiom was 'there must be a place for everybody'. This can be taken to mean that everyone has a future in Australia and everybody is valued for their contributions. This example is one I hope to follow—to respect everyone, to recognise the dignity of every person in my community, to work with the community to ensure that there is a place for everyone to learn, to work, to dream and pursue those dreams regardless of where they have come from or who they are. In Australia, everyone should be valued.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if you've never visited the suburbs of Chisholm, you might have encountered them, for it was in Box Hill in the late 19th century that artists, including Frederick McCubbin, Tom Roberts and Charles Conder, set up camp on a bit of land on David Houston's dairy farm. They painted en plein air there and in surrounding suburbs in my electorate, producing some of the most famous examples of Australian impressionism—the paintings <span style="font-style:italic;">Lost</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Down </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n His Luck </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Artists' Camp</span>. Tom Roberts's Australian pastorals on the land in my electorate show his study of light and shade, and those efforts are evident in his most magnificent work that hangs in the corridors here—<span style="font-style:italic;">Opening of the First </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Parliament </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the Commonwealth of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span>. And it is the greatest honour to be a member of the 47th Parliament and of a Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst Chisholm might look a bit different now, the remarkable contribution to cultural life continues in my electorate through the groups that meet at the beautiful Box Hill Community Arts Centre, through the talented locals who show their art at the Track Gallery in Mount Waverley or take classes at Amaroo Neighbourhood Centre, and through the Monash Gallery of Art, housed in a spectacular Seidler space in Wheelers Hill. Our electorate is the place the Skyhooks and the Living End had their start and the place where Maton guitars are manufactured. Our electorate is the place my own very first ballet concerts were performed, at the Alexander Theatre—my small contribution to the cultural history of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The arts enrich us, and I am proud of the place my community has in our nation's cultural history and I am sure in our nation's cultural future. I am thrilled to be a part of a government—a Labor government—that will deliver the first cultural policy our country has seen in almost a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the arts, education transforms and enriches our lives. I'm proud of the extraordinary contribution my community makes in developing skills, in providing educational opportunities and in fostering the ideas that will keep this nation smart, strong and successful. We are home to two universities—Monash and Deakin—several TAFE campuses and excellent schools. People want to be a part of our community because of the value we place on education, because of the chance a good education offers to build a good life and contribute to a robust democracy. All levels of education are important, from the earliest years onwards. Everyone should have access to the finest educational opportunities at all stages of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am forever grateful for the education—the keys to the kingdom—I've received in this country and for the teachers who cultivated my curiosity, like Mrs Kennedy, my English and history teacher and now one of my constituents. It was so lovely receiving correspondence from her during my campaign, and it reminded me that the course of my life may have been very different if it were not for teachers like her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I received my undergraduate education at Monash University, and, as I now move through the campus as the elected representative for that part of Melbourne, I reflect on my own journey through Australia's higher education system. I studied the humanities and social sciences because critical thinking and the capacity to analyse and to have empathy matter in a healthy society. I was encouraged in my studies by accomplished academics and was so very lucky to be awarded a scholarship to study a PhD at the University of Sydney. I hope to bring the skills that I was taught there to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm passionate about ensuring we have a robust higher education system that values intellectual curiosity and supports people to think, to experiment and to create new ideas, systems and solutions. Intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of ideas have been maligned by some, but I'm hopeful and ambitious for Australia and know that the courage to follow the thread of a new idea to imagine possibilities that improve our lives is to be valued, supported and funded. Researchers and teachers must be offered security in their work, and time and space to think and to develop their minds and those of scholars that come after them. If we are not intellectually curious, if we do not protect the independence of research and truly nurture scholarship and academia, society stands still, moribund from a poverty of ideas that demeans us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is home to the CSIRO and to the Australian Synchrotron, and the power of ideas in these institutions to change our lives, to save our lives and to discover previously unknown mysteries of the universe, as well as to enrich our minds and our spirits, is immense. I'm not afraid of ideas. I'm not afraid of imagining new possibilities for what our society could be like, spurred on by the chance to contribute to a better, fairer country. The process of learning never ends. It gives me great joy to learn from my community and my colleagues, to hear different perspectives and to listen to novel ideas. It's something I look forward to each day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The craft of a skilled trade, too, must be valued, supported and funded. The Holmesglen campuses in my community are exemplars of innovative teaching and excellence in teaching, with the world-class Victorian Tunnelling Centre in Chadstone a source of enormous pride, giving so many in our suburbs remarkable skills, the skills that mean they can build the projects that will define our cities in the future. Whether there's a dream to be a poet, a plumber or a politician, the chance should be given for these to be realised. Everyone has contributions to make, and it is our role in government to embrace and support these.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe in good government. Governments should lead with vision for the kind of society we want to be, of the types of industries we want to build and of the good, secure jobs we can create. Too many people in our country are left without the sorts of jobs they can count on, that they can build a life on. In almost every industry there are people sitting every day waiting at the end of a mobile phone to find their fate, to know if they have a job and a wage that day. This is a national problem. Our communities are starved when people cannot make the important commitment to their local footy club, neighbourhood house or art group, because they do not have certainty about their hours of work or their income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the ache of insecure work. It has been the dominant form of employment I've experienced. The feeling that everything might dissolve in a moment sticks with me now as it has throughout my working life. The experience of insecure work in academia, in cultural institutions and for some of Australia's largest employers has defined my relation to the world as one where everything is precarious and could slip away suddenly, and I do not want this to be the case for anybody else. I feel a real sadness and an anger when I think that precarity may be the experience more commonly felt than security in work for a growing number of people in this country. One of the reasons I was so motivated to be here is so that I can do my best to ensure that everyone can forge a life for themselves and their families built on security, opportunity and ambition. Until we rid our society of the scourge of unnecessary insecure work, too many people will be left behind, unable to live the lives they want to live, and should be able to live, in a country like Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that is committed to improving people's lives through making sure we have good, secure jobs so that a better future is possible. I thank the Australian Labor Party for their support, and I know that, in government, under the compassionate, clever, and courageous leadership of our Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, we will deliver a better future for all in our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party in government has always led the way in dreaming and realising what is needed to live a good life. This is in no small part also due to the bravery, the imagination, the struggle and the sacrifice of working people coming together in the trade union movement. Ordinary working people coming together through their unions and demanding their ambitions for a good life be supported by opportunity and equity is responsible for so much that we value in this country. We celebrate a superannuation system that means no-one should be left in poverty in retirement. We build our communities around the weekend, a time we can come together and enjoy our leisure time with the people and pastimes we adore. We enjoy these standards because of the union members who had a vision and who fought for and won these achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a great honour to have served with brave and kind people in the trade union movement in my working life. I thank union members, delegates and leaders from trade unions across the movement for their support of my campaign. The power of working in a collective is tremendous, and together we achieve great things. I'm so grateful to the United Workers Union members, delegates and leaders for their support and for the contribution they make every single day to a better, fairer Australia. Thanks to Tim Kennedy, Jo Schofield and Gary Bullock for their leadership and vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege to work at the oldest continuous trades and labour council in the world, the Victorian Trades Hall Council—the 'workers' parliament'—as assistant secretary. I thank the staff, leaders and affiliated unions at the hall for their friendship, especially Luke Hilakari, Wil Stracke and Amanda Threlfall. There is a neat thread through history and place between the workers' parliament and the suburbs of Chisholm. It was at the Trades Hall School of Design that Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin learned how to sketch, to paint—to be artists—long before that significant summer in 1855 when they came to Box Hill and created the works that have become a defining part of Australian culture. It reminds me: 'Yes, it is bread we fight for, but we fight for roses, too.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing here is an honour I never imagined and one that could never be achieved alone. I'm here because of the wonderful local supporters and true believers who dedicated their time to my campaign. Thank you. I'm here because of the steady focus of my campaign team: Jo Briskey, Callum Drake, Grace Flanagan, Bofeng Wu, Owen Wrangle, Phillip Danh, Jennifer Yang, Tara Cuneen, Josh Bruni, Peter Chandler, Matt Merry and Michael Watson. Thanks, too, to members here—especially the member for Bendigo, Lisa Chesters, and the member for Bruce, Julian Hill—and to Senator Grogan and Senator Walsh for their support. I'm delighted that you are now my parliamentary colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm here because of my family—the sacrifices made for me, the values instilled in me and the belief they have in me. Thank you to my family, and in particular my mother, Pam; my father, John; my sister, Olivia; and my brother, David. I'm thinking of the future, too, and what I owe to younger generations in my country, my community and my own family. To Mackinley and Bonnie: know that I will always work my hardest to make sure the future is bright for you and your generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my friends for their patience and understanding of the commitment I have made to Chisholm and for all their support. I'm standing here today because of the trust of my community. I acknowledge my predecessor, Gladys Liu, who was the member for Chisholm for three years. Thanks must go to Anna Burke, who represented Chisholm for 18 years, for her wisdom, her kindness and her support. I'm thankful to my team—Nadia Montague, Liz De La Motte, Ghariza Sujak, Naiyu Wang and Grayson Lowe—for sharing with me a dedication to serving our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Labor woman elected to this place was Joan Child, and the modern boundaries of Chisholm include some of the suburbs she represented as the member for Henty. In her first speech, Joan reminded her peers:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The basis of election to a seat in Parliament is service to people. We are really public servants. The people made our election possible. They made it possible for us to take our seats in this House. That should be remembered, but it is all too often forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not forget. I will not forget Pat and John and the fears that they shared of what would happen if we refused to act on climate change or restore faith in politics through an integrity commission. I will not forget Roger, and will demonstrate how I remember him in uniting our diverse community, repairing the wounds of division. I will not forget Angie and her bright, hopeful letter, her wish to see more good in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I carry the hopes and fears, the dreams and the disappointments of my community in this chamber. The voters of Chisholm have my deepest, sincerest thanks. But they deserve more than my gratitude. They deserve a representative who will never forget them, who will fight for them and who will show up when life is tough, not just when things are easy. I will do everything in my power to make you proud.</span>

It is with great joy that I rise to make my contribution to the address-in-reply with that memory, that reminder, so fixed in my mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent the people of Lalor, in Melbourne's outer west—an electorate centred around the old country town of Werribee that has grown into a thriving city of 300,000 people called Wyndham. I'm really pleased to stand here, after three terms in this place representing the people of Lalor, as a member of an Albanese government. I say that, in this first 100 days of government, to reflect and to think about what has already been achieved, and to reflect a little about the journey we were on during the worst parts of COVID—the long winter lockdowns of the two years. As a collective, the members now sitting on this side of the chamber put their heads together, their minds together and their skills together and listened to their communities, listened to Australians and did some deep thinking about what an opportunity it was for us to reset the way we think about our country and the way to move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We learnt many things in the first two years of the pandemic. We learnt what it really is to be essential. We learnt that the most essential workers in our community are not those who are paid the most; in fact, in many cases they are those who are paid the least. And together we set our minds, from opposition, to doing something about that. It is with great pride I note that, in the first hundred days since the election, the Albanese Labor government has already changed lives and taken action to address the pay rates of our most essential workers—those in aged care, child care, health, education and transport—who were on the front line during the pandemic and took the most risks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm reminded of the times I've been here and talked of the aged-care centre that I can see from the car park in my electoral office. I watched aged-care workers change their clothes at the boot of their car so as not to take contaminated clothes home to their families. I heard from people whose children were coming home from shifts in retail—at Macca's, for example—who were, similarly, putting their clothes into a garbage bag at the back door before entering their home so as not to contaminate others they lived with. So it is with great pride that I stand here, as a member of the Albanese Labor government, knowing that we have taken action already—that we wrote to the Fair Work Commission and told them we supported a pay rise for the lowest-paid workers in this country, and that the Fair Work Commission, respecting that, delivered it in their outcome. It's a small thing, a dollar an hour, but symbolically it's a huge thing, and it inspires and reminds us on this side of the House that the work is not finished, hence the Jobs and Skills Summit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I held a jobs and skills summit with my friend Sam Rae, the member for Hawke, across Melbourne's outer west a little over a week ago. We brought 40 critical people together in the room, and I know how much they appreciated the opportunity to tell us what life was like and give us their ideas about a better future. Of course wage stagnation was part of what they told us about. They also told us, for instance, that if you live in Melton there is no TAFE to attend in the region. It's a real reminder for us that our work's not just about announcing TAFE places—as good as that is and as welcome as it is in my community and across Melbourne's outer west—but about looking at the fine detail, suburb by suburb, region by region and community by community, and asking: Where do we need the support? Where are the gaps? It's about ensuring that every community gets the support and opportunities they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for Logan, the Treasurer, for his timely article last week, which reminded us that, although the unemployment rate has a three at the front of it, in electorates like mine and electorates like his that is not a reflection of reality. It is patchy, and we have work to do in various communities across this country, including in regional Australia, to make sure not just that we support the vulnerable and get wage increases but that we create appropriate opportunities for every single person we represent in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is with great pride that I stand here, as the member for Lalor, to recommit, on the back of listening to the wonderful speeches from the class of 2022 across the chamber, to fighting to ensure that everyone in my community and communities like mine across this country gets their share of opportunity; that everyone is given the kind of support they need. That's what we need to take this country forward and to build a better Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  Doctor shortages in my electorate of Mallee are now at crisis point. On Thursday 18 August, just two weeks ago, the Tristar medical practice in Mildura was open. But by Friday morning its doors were closed—locked by an administrator—leaving 15,200 people without a doctor. Without notice, people have been left without scripts, without an ability to get test results and no phone number to call. The administrator gave one week for people to access medical records if they found a new GP. Of course, there was no possibility of this as no GP clinic in Mildura has capacity for new patients. Patients were still showing up for their appointments at Tristar the following week and were informed by a piece of paper stuck on the door that they now had no doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost all GP clinics in Mildura have closed their books, such is the desperate situation we face. Existing patients face an average appointment wait of four weeks. In regional communities, the primary health care shortages are turning preventative health issues into emergencies. Our already crippled EDs are being put under further substantial strain. This situation is untenable. I am calling on the government to urgently implement solutions to address this crisis.</span>

The mobile health clinic travels to several areas on the Central Coast and ensures that those who are homeless, those experiencing homelessness and those otherwise unable to access health care are able to get medical assistance or advice. As well as this, HoTS provides referral services to ensure residents who are facing difficult periods receive a holistic health treatment plan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was able to announce that HoTS—Health on The Streets—would continue operating and receive $400,000 from the Albanese Labor government. Without this $400,000, HoTS faced a very uncertain future and risked no longer continuing its life-saving work. I am happy to report that HoTS can now continue with its work and have a strong presence on the Central Coast. HoTS is too important a service to lose on the Central Coast, and ensures that less pressure is placed on our already-struggling emergency departments.</span>

For many of my constituents, their pilgrimage to the boat ramps and that secret fishing spot is the highlight of their week. With the increase of traffic on the Whitsunday waters, the demand for services of the Volunteer Marine Rescue Whitsunday has increased significantly. Even the most experienced boaties can find themselves in strife and last year alone the demand for this service was up by 30 per cent, putting pressure on the resources and on this volunteer organisation. It is vital that the Whitsunday VMR, consisting of 50 dedicated volunteers, led by Mal Priday and Roger Wodson, has the appropriate technology and facilities able to keep our boaties safe on the water.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2022 federal election campaign, a federal funding commitment of $420,000 was made, thanks to the former coalition government. I call on the Labor Albanese government to commit to this. It is essential that the hardworking volunteers who watch out for our boaties have the services that they need. To the volunteers, I want to assure you that I will remain committed to supporting the expansion of the building and facilities of VMR Whitsunday, and I will fight to secure more federal government investment in regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The arts community in Melbourne's west is synonymous with the diversity and vibrancy of our multicultural nation. With their strong links between creativity, social justice and inclusion, the arts community are trailblazers. There's Footscray Community Arts, the only mainstream arts organisation nationally to register as an NDIS provider, as it strives to make art accessible to people with a disability. Even its home, a beautiful 1870s bluestone building, tells a story about community activism. A former piggery, it was saved from demolition in the 1970s after a campaign involving unionists, artists, historians and politicians. Then there's 100 Story Building, a social enterprise that works with the community's most marginalised students and young people to help their creativity and build their literacy stills. It builds their confidence and sense of belonging in storytelling, and these skills are critical to their future educational success.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these are just two of our arts pioneers. Whenever I attend a festival within Fraser—and there are many—it is artists who take centre stage. As Tony Burke noted, the arts isn't simply about entertainment and leisure; the arts affects our education policy, health policy, trade and much more. An Albanese government will restore cultural policy to its rightful place and end the culture wars.</span>

This includes an estimated 30 to 40 per cent of people on bridging visa E, who are without means to properly support their families. These are talented and hardworking people with skills in many of the sectors that have shortages. They want to contribute to our society and to our economy but have been prevented from doing so. In my electorate, this includes a young man from the Congo who has a job lined up in construction but is unable to take it because he's waiting over three months to receive work rights. Whilst he's been ably supported by the Sydney Asylum Seekers Centre, the delay is hurting him and hurting our economy. Swift action needs to start to address the blight of Australia's human rights record and support the urgent needs of businesses now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to raise a worrying rise in anti-Semitism across our community. In the past two weeks, the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies has received reports of two new cases of anti-Semitism and bullying in Sydney's east. These include students reportedly performing Nazi salutes in boys changing rooms. These incidents come fresh off the back of revelations of another school, where students used a chat room to share racist, homophobic and violent misogynistic content. All members of our community need to feel safe and to be able to practise their faith in freedom. We need urgent action now to fight anti-Semitism.</span>

Dylan Schwarz, 18, is competing in his first international event, while Corena Harrison is a wily veteran of the Australian squad, having competed internationally previously in Dubai, Portugal and New Zealand.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Boccia, for the uninitiated, is played indoors and tests competitors' degree of muscle control and accuracy. Competing in wheelchairs, athletes throw, kick or use a ramp device to propel leather balls as close as possible to a white ball called the jack. Australia medalled for the first time in 25 years at the Tokyo Paralympics. I can attest to what a challenge boccia is, with Dylan and Corena regularly crushing me in the special events we have down at the Tuggeranong Archery Club. Dylan and Corena, supported by their coach, Barry Yesberg, who is also travelling to Rome, have worked incredibly hard over the last 12 months despite the challenges of COVID. Dylan is looking to taking on his idol, David Smith, from the UK, a much greater challenge than me! You'll be able to watch the event being livestreamed from the www.worldboccia.com site. Thanks to the Vikings Group, the AIS and the boccia community for their support of Dylan and Corena.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Imagine that you had to choose between paying your rent or seeing your GP to examine that strange lump on your neck, or whether to put food on the table or get your child the care they need. These are the choices that millions of Australians are now having to make. There are also millions of Australians, in rural and regional areas particularly, who have to wait months to see a GP. Why? Well, firstly, there are simply not enough GPs in Australia. And, secondly, the Medicare rebate was frozen for so long between 2013 and 2019 that now, in order to keep their businesses afloat, GPs are making the hard decision to charge patients an out-of-pocket expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Deloitte, by 2030 there will be a shortfall of nearly 25 per cent of GPs in the workforce, nearly 11,000 GPs. This is a crisis, because GPs are at the forefront of both acute medicine and preventative medicine. Not enough GPs are being trained, because the stagnant Medicare rebate was not enough to attract them, especially when other medical specialties are better remunerated. We must lift the Medicare rebate and we must run a campaign to attract medical students into the specialty of general practice.</span>

They are a wonderful research organisation near the electorate of Werriwa, and they have been in existence for almost 10 years. The extent of their research is endless, from cancer to mental health, and it is important to the south-west of Sydney and to medical research more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 50 per cent of Australians have one or more chronic health conditions, and this has been increasing over the last decade. Research institutes like Ingham are incredibly important to identify the conditions affecting our communities as well as researching treatments and cures for the diseases. A community partnership with the south-west health district provides expertise and the best research and medical talent in Australia, and the fact that we have such a diverse community also helps with that research. Despite south-west Sydney having a significantly lower median age than the rest of New South Wales, chronic conditions are very prevalent, at nearly the same or higher rates. The institute understands the value of treatment, management, cure and outreach to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really appreciate the time I spent with the Ingham CEO, Darryl Harkness, and Lance Chia from the Liverpool Innovation Precinct, who updated me on the recent breakthroughs. I thank all the researchers at the Ingham institute for what they're doing and for all the breakthroughs to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I rise today to congratulate the Outback Highway Development Council on the 25th anniversary of successfully lobbying to create the Outback Way, Australia's longest shortcut. Twenty-five years ago, Pat Hill, President of the Shire of Laverton in the northern Goldfields of O'Connor, moved a motion at the conference of the Australian Local Government Association calling for the sealing of the 2,700 kilometres route from Laverton to Winton in western Queensland. This would create an iconic new trans-Australia tourism route that would also enhance the movement of agricultural produce and freight and connect remote Aboriginal communities. Since 1997, the five shires along the Outback Way have worked tirelessly to make this a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently attended the Outback Way AGM and met with Winton Shire Council Mayor Gavin Baskett, Councillor Shane Mann and CEO Ricki Bruhn; Boulia Shire Council Mayor Rick Britton, Councillor Jack Neilson and CEO Lynn Moore; from O'Connor, Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku CEO Kevin Hannagan; and Shire of Laverton President Patrick Hill, Councillors Robin Prentice and Rex Weldon and CEO Phil Marshall. They are continuing the legacy of previous mayors, shire presidents and councillors in literally paving the Outback Way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, they have successfully secured almost $1.2 billion in state, territory and federal funding. The first federal investment of $10 million was announced by then Prime Minister John Howard in 2006, and in the May budget the then Deputy Prime Minister announced that the coalition government would commit $678 million, which would see the remaining gravel bituminised. I sincerely hope the Albanese government will honour this commitment to complete the Outback Way, an amazing nation-building program.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I rise to acknowledge Corporal Reg Hillier, the only Territorian killed in the Vietnam War. Reg grew up around Darwin, riding horses and mustering cattle, and he learnt from Aboriginal stockmen how to track animals in the bush. He joined the Army, and in 1965, at age 26, he was posted to Vietnam, where he used the bush skills he'd learnt in the north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reg was, tragically, killed in action on 29 November 1965 as his battalion, 1 RAR, cleared a village. His family were told that it would cost 1,000 pounds to have his body returned home—a sum they just couldn't afford. Against their wishes, he was buried in Malaysia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hillier family fought hard for decades to have Reg brought home to the Top End. I commend the president of Veterans Australia NT, Vietnam veteran Bob Shewring OAM, for his efforts to bring them home. He established, with others, a campaign to repatriate the remains of Australians that were buried overseas, usually because their families couldn't afford it. Bob has written a terrific book, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Reg</span>, which I was happy to launch recently with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and also an Australian legend, Keith Payne VC, in Darwin. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Across all corners of Northern Tasmania this past weekend, coaches, parents and players from netball, soccer and AFL gathered on courts and muddy grounds to play their final games of the winter season. Anyone involved in club sport is acutely aware that the months of weekday training and weekend games do not happen without volunteers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I want to recognise a special one: Scott Flynn. Scott—or Bruiser, as he is affectionately known—is renowned for his post-game catchcry to players, 'Jumpers in the bag, rubbish in the bin,' and has been the stalwart of the St Patrick's College football club for over three decades, including 31 years on the committee, 21 years as secretary and eight years as bar manager. Scott's dedication earned him life membership in 2002 and 'official club legend' in 2011. Every year, the Scott Flynn Medal is awarded to the best player at the president's lunch. Much to the joy of the St Patrick's football community, just last week Scott was announced as the winner of the AFL Community Football National Volunteer of the Year award, a just award for someone described by St Patrick's College football club president, Ian McCallum, as the face of the club. 'He adds to the character of the club. You couldn't imagine the football club without Scott Flynn,' Ian said. To top off what was already a big week, Scott's beloved team won the NTFA division 1 premiership, defeating Old Scotch by 27 points. My congratulations to Scott and the team.</span>

Last month, I was privileged to attend the launch of the BAPS Swaminarayan Research Institute in Australia, in the revered presence of a Mahamahopadhyaya at the BAPS mandir in Greenfields, in the Makin electorate. His Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj lived by the motto, 'In the joy of others lies our own.' He spoke of peace and harmony, of love for others and of building better people, better communities and a better world. He was widely respected by other world leaders. Today, in a world filled with so much conflict, hardship, unrest and troubles, we need leadership that stands on the values espoused by His Holiness and responds to the daily humanitarian struggles of people everywhere. His Holiness set a wonderful example that today is celebrated and continued throughout the world, not only by his followers but by so many others, and these are values that we can all learn from.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise to speak on the urgent need for the Victorian state Labor government to get on with the job and start road works on Racecourse Road and McGregor Road. To go back in history, in 2019 the previous Liberal government committed $13 million to McGregor Road upgrades, an additional lane on the Monash off-ramp to McGregor Road, extra dual on- and off-ramps from the Monash on the western side, and also $70 million on the duplication of Racecourse Road past the Monash Freeway to Henry Road with dual on- and off-ramps, again, and intersection lights at Baldhill Road. The $83 million proposal was put together by the Cardinia Shire Council's road engineers. It has since blown out under state Labor, and we've had to come up with a package of nearly $400 million to get state Labor to start the road work. And do you know what? They still haven't started. Get on with the job and make this road happen. I cannot believe the Labor members on the other side of the chamber find it amusing that so much money is being wasted. We need to make sure these projects get done and get done on time. The interesting thing I see is the grade separations—and I thank the state Labor government for starting the grade separations—happening just before the state election. Get on with it and start Racecourse Road and McGregor Road. The Liberals delivered the Monash Freeway and Beaconsfield interchange road. Can Labor just deliver something?</span>

In 2019, the Morrison Liberal government cut our communities' access through local GP clinics to recruit doctors from overseas to deliver Medicare funded services. This was just one of the ways the Liberals made it harder and more expensive to see a doctor locally and around the nation. This had a direct impact on local GP clinics, with a loss of 40 per cent of local GPs. This was predictable, and we raised it from opposition repeatedly.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise today in support of the people of my electorate of Longman who have a mortgage or pay rent, which, of course, is the vast majority. These customers are being treated with contempt by their banks, which are making record profits. We see landlords being forced to push up rents to cover mortgage payments to already struggling families in our community, all in the name of greed and profits. We've all watched as interest rate increases announced by the RBA are more often than not passed on quickly and in full. This is in contrast to interest rate cuts being passed on slowly, in part or not at all. It is simply un-Australian to have your cake and eat it as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the issue with publicly listed companies, because the shareholder, not the customer, is the priority. The bottom line will always be increased to benefit the shareholder at the expense of the customer. CEOs are paid obscene salaries and bonuses, with KPIs and targets all set around the bottom line, never around customer service and satisfaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this begs the question of the new government: what are you doing to help this cohort that are suffering these cost-of-living challenges? History tells us that the people of Australia, on average, have endured higher interest rates under Labor governments than under coalition governments. So I suspect the answer is they will do nothing as they simply have no economic prowess at all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Last week, I had the privilege of meeting with a young man from St Kilda called Blake. Until this meeting, I am told that Blake had never actually reached out to an MP, but it was Blake's concern around the monkeypox disease and his willingness to advocate on behalf of his community to get information that will help protect people that drove him to reach out. Like many young people, Blake was just trying to do the right thing by himself, his friends and his community. I was pleased to let Blake know that the first shipment of monkeypox vaccine has already arrived in Australia. There have been 20,000 doses distributed throughout the country. In the second half of September, we're expecting a further 100,000 doses to arrive in Australia, which will go straight into the arms of the most at-risk people. Then a further 350,000 doses will be arriving in the third batch.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, to administer the vaccine as quickly as possible, we've been partnering with organisations like Thorne Harbour Health in my electorate, who do an amazing job of protecting the community and of working with the community to get out vaccines not just for this but for many other issues. There's an EOI process, which I will put the information on in the comments on this speech, with the state government. I just wanted to reassure Blake and thank him for his advocacy and say that more vaccines are on the way and we appreciate everyone doing the right thing in getting jabbed to protect themselves and their community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Yesterday marked the start of National Child Protection Week. The overarching message for the week is that every child in every community needs a fair go. As a society, we need to keep looking at what children and families need to thrive, and we need to ensure we're working diligently to catch criminals who prey on children, especially through the growing threat of online exploitation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I joined with the Centre to Counter Child Exploitation to launch their Stop the Stigma program, which was designed to spark an important discussion. ACCCE research has shown that child sexual abuse and online sexual exploitation is a stigmatised topic and is not well understood. Only by bringing this conversation into the light, by opening a discussion, can we reduce stigma and build awareness. Just like we encourage children to speak up if they're offered a ride with a stranger, Stop the Stigma is all about starting a similar conversation about keeping children safe from sexual exploitation online. This shouldn't be embarrassing or shameful. We all have a part to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child abuse thrives in the shadows. Speaking up is difficult, but it educates the unaware, protects the innocent, gives a voice to victims and brings offenders to justice. I encourage all Australians to learn more about the work of ACCCE.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  It was a real pleasure to attend a post-flood gathering in Chelmer with local residents and some of the services that did such a great job responding to the flood disaster in March. The gathering was at Toco Italiano restaurant, in Oxley Road, a very popular local Italian restaurant run by Arturo and Mahoney, both very generous people. Despite Arturo and Mahoney having their own home flooded, they and their staff did a wonderful job firing up the pizzas for locals, people that were flooded, people that had their power cut during the March flood. The pizzas were provided for free, and Arturo, Mahoney and their staff provided a wonderful beacon of kindness in our damaged community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This fundraiser and appreciation event was organised by Arturo and Graceville local Martin Finbow. It was a great afternoon, catching up with everyone over some delicious food. Certificates of appreciation were handed out by local Senior Sergeant Mick Coulson to representatives from the Army, Energex, the Queensland fire service, and, of course, our wonderful friends at Toco Italiano. And the local children were very impressed with the fire truck!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to forget that there are many in the Moreton community who are still not back in their houses. All are now without flood insurance. The floods this year were a tough and stressful time for so many, but people across my electorate, like Arturo and the staff at Toco Italiano, rose to the task. They supported family and friends and strangers, and did so much to help and comfort others. Thank you, Arturo and Mahoney and all of your staff.</span>

There have been no details provided on their 90 per cent subsidy policy, which they've pushed to the backburner claiming it's too costly to introduce now and would place further pressures on the sector.</span>

This government appears to have no plans to address workforce issues, no plans to address the skills shortage and no plan for the future of the sector. It's been 100 days of this Albanese government, and it has already let families down, across the sector, with early education costs set to increase under this government.</span>

It's extraordinary that this second sitting fortnight of this parliament has started with the opposition trying to say that all of the problems that face Australia at the moment have, miraculously, happened in the last 100 days! It's extraordinary that you could be in power for nine long years, could leave a budget burdened with a trillion dollars of debt, and, with a straight face, could come into the parliament and say, 'Goodness me, the last hundred days have been bad!' It's honestly like they were sleepwalking through government and have only just woken up now that they're on the other side of the chamber. If only they had—I don't know—come to the Jobs and Skills Summit, they might be able to be part of the conversation about the plan for the future. If only they as a government had done something about stagnant wages, we wouldn't be the ones who have to act now. But we are and we will.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:00</span>):  on indulgence—I wish to acknowledge and pay tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev on his death. Striding warmly into the chill of the Cold War, Mikhail Gorbachev helped set history on what was, for a while at least, such a hopeful new course. Behind his fresh face was a radically open mind, one brimming with ideas that extended far beyond simply maintaining what was an increasingly sclerotic status quo. He was a communist that even Margaret Thatcher was able to take a shine to. Bob Hawke described his own 2.5-hour one-on-one meeting with Gorbachev in the Kremlin as one of the most compelling of his prime ministership. It was an extraordinary time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the leader of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev brought openness to a closed society with his policy of glasnost. Dissidents were freed, as were many banned books and films. As some of the darker truths of Soviet history were confronted, journalists began to report more honestly on the present. With perestroika he tried to restructure a system deeply resistant to any such attempts. The nations of eastern Europe had their sovereignty restored and were freed from Soviet hegemony. Working together with President Ronald Reagan he achieved breakthroughs in arms control, including for some nuclear weapons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, while he was a man of great vision, his foresight was patchier. He did not always predict the seismic consequences of his reforms, nor did he imagine that they would precipitate the very end of the USSR. As he dryly noted in his resignation speech, 'Events went a different way.' Tragically, the demise of the Soviet Union was not bloodless. On Gorbachev's watch, the military was used to crush dissent, including in Lithuania and Georgia. It is a cruel paradox that, during a time of exhilarating new freedoms, people were killed fighting for theirs. But it should also be noted that Gorbachev regularly resisted the urgings from hardline colleagues and the KGB to uphold the Soviet tradition of power through fear and through force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a man of principle, hope, resolve and enormous courage, and he did change the world. In a world profoundly divided, he was driven by an instinct for cooperation and unity. Ultimately, he lifted a great shadow that lay over humanity. And he strove to lift other shadows. Indeed, I spent time with him in Brisbane in 2006, when he co-chaired Earth Dialogues, the significant international energy and security conference. He was still very much a towering global figure, but I will always count it as a privilege to have had the chance to engage with such a world figure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late in life when Gorbachev was asked what his epitaph should be he answered, 'We tried.' A true giant of the 20th century, he changed the world for the better. May he rest in peace.</span>

Unlike other leaders in the Soviet party who were born before the Russian Revolution, Gorbachev was a child of the Soviet system. His family were peasants and experienced the horrors of the 1930s and 1940s: agricultural collectivisation, Stalin's purges, Nazi invasion and occupation, and, of course, famine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many during Stalin's great terror, Gorbachev's grandfathers were arrested on fabricated charges. One was exiled and the other imprisoned for 14 months. Those early experiences naturally shaped the man. Despite these hardships, Gorbachev was a star student and a prolific reader. Testimony to his early leadership potential, he organised sport and social activities and was liked and trusted by his classmates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his late teens he spent several summers farming the land with his father, working 20-hour days and operating a mammoth combine harvester. For helping to produce a record harvest in 1948, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. That decoration, combined with his intelligence, saw the unlikely boy rise from a peasant background and walk through the doors of Moscow State University in 1950 to study law. One year later at a dance he would meet his future wife, Raisa Titarenko, whose family also suffered under Stalin's cruelty. In 1952, motivated by patriotism, future promise and the pressure to conform, Gorbachev joined the Communist Party, as many others had done. Upon graduating from university in 1955 he returned to his native region in the city of Stavropol. He took up his first political job in the Communist Party's youth organisation. His career would see him rise through the party's ranks from first secretary of the Stavropol regional committee in 1970 to secretary of the central committee in 1978 to appointment to the politburo in 1980 and finally to general secretary in 1985, the last leader of the Soviet Union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the time Gorbachev was in the top job, the horrors, oppression and demoralisation of the Soviet system were of course known beyond the Iron Curtain, with the publishing of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gulag Archipelago</span>. Then in 1986 those realities were amplified as news spread of the Chernobyl disaster. With the corrupt Soviet system already cracking, Gorbachev set out to reform it through the policies of restructuring and openness—particularly, through perestroika and glasnost. Indeed it was Gorbachev's openness which saw him cultivate warm relations with President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher to tear down the wall and to do business. Gorbachev wanted the socialist system to live up to its original ideals. Historian Archie Brown described him as:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a pragmatist … with an extraordinary capacity for learning and adjustment … the vanguard of reform and the guarantor of its continuity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gorbachev's endeavours to democratise Soviet socialism, to weaken the state and to strengthen the individual inevitably saw the system collapse, and biographer William Taubman said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Gorbachev made it to the top by seeming to be an ideal product of the Soviet system—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">but masterfully consolidated power to transform it. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He dismantled an empire (or acquiesced in its dismemberment) without the orgy of blood and violence that has accompanied the breakup of so many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For that achievement Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. Twenty-four years after he resigned as the leader of the Soviet Union and after the dissolution of the USSR, Gorbachev wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">An optimist is someone dissatisfied with the existing state of affairs who is not resigned to it and constantly looks … for opportunities to make the world a better place … I declare myself an optimist.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the world remains optimistic that Russia's future will have more Gorbachevs and fewer Putins. On behalf of the opposition and on behalf of the coalition I offer my heartfelt condolences to Mr Gorbachev's daughter, Irina, and his family. May he rest in peace.</span>

Prime Minister, prior to the last election Labor promised a $275 cut to power bills on nearly 100 occasions. Since the election you've never mentioned it. Last week the government promised a return to industry-wide bargaining, which will mean more strikes and will drive up the cost of living for families in our country. Why are Australian families paying the price for the Prime Minister's new priorities?</span>

Perhaps one of those was from the Liberal Party and one was from the National Party—a bit like last week, when they couldn't agree whether they should attend the Jobs and Skills Summit. It's a bit like that; some were in, some were out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a common theme, which is that those opposite seek to forget the fact they've just been in government for almost a decade. They think 21 May was ground zero. They think 21 May was when Federation occurred. But, in fact, in March, those opposite sat on an increase in wholesale electricity prices. They sat on it, and, consistent with their attitude and their approach towards transparency in government, they didn't tell anyone. It's not surprising they didn't tell anyone, because we know now they didn't have one energy minister, did they? They didn't have one. Perhaps one of the energy ministers knew exactly what was occurring! Nonetheless, the people who didn't know were the Australian people. Then they have the hide to come in here and ask an incoherent babble of a question—</span>

                  </a>  What we did—it was in December last year—was put out a coherent policy, after a decade of inaction, after 22 policy announcements—and none of them delivered. What we know is that there was a 23rd policy. The 23rd policy was put up in March, of an increase that they are responsible for, which came into effect because it was deliberately delayed by the then government until after the election. We stand by our modelling that we put out. We stand by the fact that renewables are the cheapest form of new energy. It's not really rocket science. You don't really need an economics degree or a science degree to know that if the market changes from a more expensive level of energy to a cheaper level of energy you get cheaper energy prices. I know that might be beyond those opposite, but that's exactly what the Australian people know. That's why they've got solar panels on their roofs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I congratulate her on her first speech to the parliament just before question time and I look forward to her making an outstanding contribution for the people of the Illawarra. The Jobs and Skills Summit exceeded, I think, everyone's expectations. The fact is that it was a resounding success that changed the whole mood of politics and the way that it's conducted. We brought together business, unions, community leaders, people from across the political spectrum—with one little group excepted—and all those who are interested in creating a fair-wage, strong-growth, high-productivity economy going forward, all those who understood that the skills crisis is something that's developed over the last decade and needs addressing, all those who understood that enterprise bargaining at the moment isn't working to lift productivity and it's not working to lift wages either. As a result of the cooperative approach, we came up with 36 concrete outcomes, including $1.1 billion in additional federal and state funding for fee-free TAFE from 2023. Just for the next financial year, that is 180,000 places. I thank the premiers and chief ministers from throughout the country, from across the political spectrum, who joined with us in that.</span>

There will be an additional 500 workers there. There will be more flexibility in the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to encourage private sector and superannuation investment, making an enormous difference going forward.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the board, there was a constructive approach. People came and didn't just try to dig a deeper trench in the same old battlefield. People put aside their differences. They participated constructively. It will be remembered and contrasted with the 1983 summit, where there was just one woman represented. This time around, it was fifty-fifty representation. The summit showed that bringing people together—the premiers and chief ministers, business, unions, the Business Council, COSBOA—sitting down with unions and sitting down with workers is constructive. I think Jennifer Westacott summed it up when she said:</span>

I refer to the Prime Minister's captain's call to invite CFMEU boss Christy Cain to his union talkfest. Mr Cain has previously been charged with common assault, has described John Setka as 'one of the most fair-dinkum people in this country' and on Thursday said, 'If you're not at the table, you're part of the menu.' Will the Prime Minister apologise for inviting this misogynist thug, or was it payback for millions in dirty CFMEU donations?</span>

The reason the Jobs and Skills Summit was such a resounding success was that people were prepared to come from all parts of our economy and all corners of our country, to come together around some of the big economic challenges that we confront. People at the summit from right across the country, right across the economy and most parts of the parliament knew and understood that it is time to draw a line under the divisive decade of missed opportunities and warped priorities which have made our economy weaker and our people poorer as a consequence.</span>

                  </a>  One of the outcomes of the Jobs and Skills Summit was drawing a line under a divisive decade of missed opportunities and warped priorities which have made the economy weaker and our people poorer. I want to thank everybody who participated in that summit, who came there not seeking unanimity but seeking common ground. We found that common ground and we are now ready to move forward together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We wanted the summit to achieve at least three things—first of all, to bring people together around those big challenges; secondly, to agree on some proposals for immediate action; and, thirdly, to set a clear direction for future work. And that is exactly what happened. On Friday, we released an outcomes document that came from the conversations and the consensus that we achieved at the summit. At the centre of that is maintaining full employment in a way that benefits more of our people. At the centre of it was improving productivity growth at the end of the worst decade for productivity in 50 years. We came together to deal with the labour shortages and the skills shortages which are acting as a handbrake on our economy. We came together to boost wages, to get wages growing again, after a decade of deliberate wage stagnation and wage suppression. We came together to invest in the industries and in the jobs which will deliver the opportunities for our people into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To help do all this, the outcomes included 36 initiatives that we are taking immediate action on, including boosting investment in fee-free TAFE, boosting the amount that pensioners can earn from work, beginning the work to repair the broken bargaining system which has been a key contributor to wage stagnation for too long and responsibly increasing the permanent migration target to address the labour shortages which are affecting all Australians. All of these areas are about responding to our economic challenges. That's what the summit was about and that's what the government is about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the summit, Australians saw us working together to tackle these challenges. Employers, unions, premiers, chief ministers, the Australian of the Year, the Leader of the Nationals and the crossbenchers were all prepared to seek that common ground and to have a go and not have a whinge. In that regard, the Leader of the Opposition was left out, wallowing in his own irrelevance.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:28</span>):  I thank the member for his question. I am very pleased that I'm back in public housing. It's got to be said: it's a lot better than my first public house! But the fact is that a range of people are certainly under housing affordability stress. They're finding it difficult to get into the housing market and finding it difficult to pay the rent and pay the bills. That's why we have a Housing Australia Future Fund, because we recognise what we need to do is have a comprehensive plan to deal with housing issues in this country. We have our Housing Australia Future Fund that will create 30,000 additional social housing units. Indeed, on Thursday and Friday at the summit, one of the initiatives was to use the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to encourage investment in affordable housing from the private sector and from superannuation funds. This is a fund of some $575 million. We will hope to leverage that fund in order to attract investment from those—including the superannuation sector—who are looking for those long-term returns. That is why it makes sense to use that facility. And it's another initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, we have our $100 million, additional, that we will put into emergency housing. We know that too many people get turned away from emergency housing, particularly victims of family violence; too many women and children are turned away each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we'll take these policies seriously. I'd say to the Greens political party that they could do a lot better if they could point to one area, in one time, in my constituency or others, in which they actually supported an affordable housing strategy, in which they supported the sorts of plans that have been put in place with the cooperation of the private sector and the public sector, particularly local government. And that would be a good thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd welcome his support in the Inner West Council, but in others as well where Greens representatives have consistently voted against projects like the project right next to Marrickville Station, where they said, 'We couldn't have medium density housing there,' and voted against the project—even though it would give people in affordable housing an opportunity to get to work right from that train line at Marrickville.</span>

This is an important step to attack the cost-of-living pressures and support those on pensions and social security payments, but this is just the beginning of what we, as a government, in our short time in office, have been working towards. We took immediate action to freeze the deeming rates for two years for pensioners, as of July. This will ease the cost-of-living pressure for so many pensioners. We have a bill in front of the Senate ensuring that 50,000 more older Australians will get the benefit from the Commonwealth seniors health care card.</span>

Of course, they had nine years in which to introduce their measures—nine years in which they sat on their hands and did nothing. It has taken the election of an Albanese government to bring people together at the jobs summit, to explore ways we can help pensioners boost their income and to actually turn that into action. That is so much more than the rhetoric from the other side, with no action over nine years. Pensioners are pleased that this government is in charge and taking action to help with the cost of living. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He is asking a question about wages and the cost of living after a decade of deliberate wage suppression and wage stagnation under those opposite. The changes that we are working through, in consultation with employers, with unions and with the broader Australian community, are about seeking more and better agreements and not more conflict. If those opposite had their way, we would have another decade of wages stagnating and ordinary working Australians falling further and further behind. Our efforts at the jobs summit, whether in the area of the minister for industrial relations or in all of the other areas that we have paid such close attention to, are about getting wages moving again in this economy. The defining failure of those opposite—the dregs of the former government which sit before me—is that wages barely shifted for a decade. That meant that ordinary Australian people—</span>

                  </a>  For too long in this economy, ordinary Australians and their living standards have been going backwards. That's because those opposite, over almost a decade in office, deliberately went after people's wages, job security and working conditions. They even admitted in a burst of candour that low wages were a deliberate design feature of their economic policy.</span>

We think that stagnant wages are a defining feature of the failure of those opposite to manage the economy in the interests of working people. What we want to do—what the jobs summit was about, what our government is about, what our Prime Minister is about and what our cabinet is about—is to get wages moving again in this economy, because people find it too difficult to keep up with the skyrocketing costs of living. The changes that we are consulting on, the changes which were discussed at the Jobs and Skills Summit, are all about looking for more agreement, not more conflict. We want to get wages moving again. We think that's the best way for Australians to deal with the substantial cost-of-living pressures that they face.</span>

If you lot had your way, we'd have another decade of wage stagnation and ordinary Australian working people copping it in the neck.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  Thanks to the member for her question about the cost of living. I think we all appreciate and understand that Australians in every corner of our country are doing it especially tough right now—that the cost-of-living pressures are acute and the cost of some of the essentials that Australians just can't do without is going through the roof. Obviously, part of this is about global pressures, particularly on energy markets and food security. Clearly there are some domestic attributes there. Some of the supply chain issues, which were a feature of the discussion at the Jobs and Skills Summit last week, are part of the challenge as well. I think that there is an expectation right across the board that rising interest rates are set to be an even bigger part of the pain that people confront. Tomorrow the Reserve Bank board will meet again. We don't pre-empt or interfere in any way with their independent decisions, but the market expectations are for another increase, and that will be an additional cost on people who are paying off a mortgage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The task for our government is to do what we responsibly can to help people through these shorter-term challenges but to also deal with the issues in supply chains, deal with cost of living where we can and build an economy that grows wages and improves living standards over time. That's why it's so important that the payments that the minister mentioned a moment ago will increase this month in line with inflation. It's why we successfully argued for an increase in the minimum wage in line with inflation, despite the howls of opposition from those opposite.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr CHALMERS:</span>
                  </a>  That's why our October budget will cut the price of medicines. That's why I've instructed the ACCC to step up and maximise their surveillance of fuel markets to make sure savings in petrol prices are passed on and motorists are getting a fair deal when the excise relief comes off. It's why we're delivering long-term reforms to deal with some of those supply chain issues, to deal with the skills crisis we were left with, to lift the speed limit on the economy. That means cheaper child care, a game-changing investment to ease the cost of living but also deliver an economic dividend. It means investing in cleaner and cheaper energy, investing in fee-free TAFE and growing the care economy, advance manufacturing and other key sectors of the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Jobs and Skills Summit was a really crucial part of this work. It focused on improving productivity. We know that grows wages. It focused on skills. It focused on breaking down the barriers to employment that too many people still face. It focused on fixing a broken bargaining system that has only delivered wage stagnation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, while the government works on these serious cost-of-living pressures that Australian families face, we invited those opposite to be part of the solution and not part of the problem. They rejected that because, if they had their way, there would be another decade of the same cost-of-living pressures and wage stagnation that they've subjected the Australian people to. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I thank the member for Fraser for asking this very important question. I thank him for shining a light on this important issue as well as providing an opportunity to clarify some of the statements made by the member for Hume earlier today. This Albanese Labor government is committed to improving and adapting to the needs of currently serving defence personnel, veterans and families. That's why I'm proud that a key initiative from last week's Jobs and Skills Summit goes exactly to that. Aged and veteran pensioners will be able to earn an additional $4,000 over this financial year without losing any of their pension, due to the Albanese Labor government providing a one-off income credit designed to give older Australians the option to work and keep more of their money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very concerned that the member for Hume seems not to understand this policy, given his statement today in the media that, apparently, we 'excluded veterans'. Well, I'm prepared to give the member for Hume the benefit of the doubt. After all, we should err towards incompetence over conspiracy. To assist the member for Hume: if he turns to the very first line of the media release from the Prime Minister announcing this policy, it says 'age and veterans pensioners'. The policy announced on Friday in relation to the work bonus bank includes veterans and dependents who receive the service pension—that's the age service pension, the partner service pension, or the income support supplement paid to war widows or wholly dependent partners who are over the qualifying age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community has a clear expectation that veterans and their families will be well looked after. We are committed to delivering a package of practical support measures that will improve the welfare and wellbeing of veterans and families, building on the services already available. In preparation for last week's Jobs and Skills Summit, I've been meeting with businesses, veterans, recruitment agencies and ex-service organisations to develop a veterans' employment white paper. One of the key outcomes of those meetings is the need to support veterans in the civilian workforce, not just as they transition immediately after service but later in life as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy announced on Friday will enable veterans to do more work to earn more money before they start losing their pension, which serves two purposes. At a time of serious skills shortage, it means we can get access through this measure to more skilled labour. Importantly, it will also make it easier for veterans to go back to or remain in the workplace while receiving their pension. In addition to the increased income this provides them, it's great for their mental health as well because it means they can remain mentally engaged and give back to their communities. This is a win-win, and it is something that, despite their rhetoric now, those opposite failed to deliver in nearly a decade in office. What this means is that a veteran on the service pension now could take any job. For example, they might want to work at a local steakhouse, and they could serve the member for Hume a well-done Angus.</span>

First of all, it's not unusual for ministers for workplace relations to write to the Fair Work Commission—not unusual at all. It's not unusual for them to write to the Fair Work Commission in order to update the Fair Work Commission on what's happening with legislation. Later today we will debate the Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2022. The Fair Work Commission received two letters from me in advance of that coming to the House, letting them know, because it had an impact on their workload. It's a completely normal thing to do. In fact, Andrew Stewart, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Law, said only today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's nothing unusual or inappropriate about the minister writing to the Fair Work Commission to indicate that there are going to be some changes to the law which will potentially affect the way in which the commission does its work. It's something that actually happens quite routinely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference, though, between the letters and correspondence that used to go to the Fair Work Commission and what goes to the Fair Work Commission now is a big difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when, for example, the former minister, Christian Porter, wrote to the Fair Work Commission, he wrote to them to be able to cut penalty rates. That was how he wrote to them. When each time came around—I've written four times. I've written to them with respect to the annual wage review; the aged-care wage review; family and domestic violence leave; and unilateral termination of agreements. On all four times, none of those were letters that the previous government would have written. I get that, because all of them advance wages and conditions—every single one—and did so, particularly with the annual wage review and the aged-care review, in areas that disproportionately helped narrow the gender pay gap. Both of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So with respect to the specific letter that the member asks about: first of all, I don't know what application from the New South Wales government she's referring to because there isn't one on that issue. It actually doesn't exist, so I'm not exactly sure what I'm meant to be intervening on. But if you look at the timing of this versus the timing of the letters that went with respect to family and domestic violence leave, on each case the Fair Work Commission was advised once a decision of government had been made. That is the respectful thing to do; that's the appropriate thing to do. Those opposite might not be used to concepts where people are notified of something that is relevant to them. I'm sure Josh would have loved a letter being told, 'By the way, I'm Treasurer too'! I'm sure there's a whole lot of notification, that respectful notification, where those opposite think, 'Maybe that should have happened previously.' But what has happened here is completely orderly and the right thing to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I thank the member for Bennelong for his very important question. As I've said in this place before, small businesses really are the engine room of our economy. Indeed, they do employ millions of Australians and do contribute more than $400 billion to our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're already delivering for small businesses, but we know the significant economic and employment challenges that they continue to face. We know that they've had a tough few years, with fire, floods and the pandemic, but they've been incredibly resilient and it was important that they had a role to play in terms of the Jobs and Skills Summit. In the lead-up to the Jobs and Skills Summit, I hosted several round tables, and I want to put on the record my thanks to the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, the small business ombudsman, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the HIA for hosting those round tables for me in the lead-up to the Jobs and Skills Summit. At those round tables, we heard of course about the skills shortages. We heard about supply chain issues and we heard about the issues and the inherited trillion dollars of debt that we've got—and, of course, increasing energy costs and inflation, and how they're impacting on small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course some of the outcomes of the Jobs and Skills Summit for small businesses are really important to address, particularly when it comes to the migration program and increasing skilled labour. We know that these small businesses have been screaming out for more skilled labour. We also know that the visa backlog has been impacting small businesses, so that is a really important and welcome decision. We know, of course, that the establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia has been really welcomed by small businesses, because they understand that the only way to deal with the skills shortages long term is to have better training and skills for Australians to be able to meet those shortages. Our fee-free TAFE announcement was critical for the small businesses: 180,000 places in the first year, to be able to share with states and territories in implementing those. And of course we've heard about the aged pensioners and the temporary upfront $4,000 income bank credit to allow them to work more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we welcome the agreement between COSBOA and the employee's representatives, the unions. It's great to see workers and small businesses come together on an agreement that the current enterprise-bargaining system is not working for the small businesses, nor is it working for the employees. Indeed, this agreement is really important for all of those people working in small businesses and all of the small business owners. These measures build on what we're already delivering as part of our election commitments. We're building on our Commonwealth procurement changes and our unfair contract terms legislation, which is being introduced to parliament—</span>

In order to reach and exceed the government's 43 per cent emissions reduction target, all sectors of our economy must adapt. That includes how we fund infrastructure projects like the Western Harbour Tunnel and the Beaches Link in my electorate of North Sydney. Will the minister make infrastructure funding for projects such as these contingent on a project delivering a carbon base case which would track and limit emissions over the life cycle of the project from design through to construction?</span>

It can make a substantial contribution, and I thank her for her interest in it. I am aware of the proposal from Infrastructure Partnerships Australia to introduce a carbon base case for infrastructure projects and programs over $100 million. I want to work with industry and with others who have ideas in this space to implement new ways to work towards our goal of achieving a 43 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there is no current accurate and consistent way across the country to actually estimate the carbon base case for infrastructure projects. I am happy to receive proposals and also very happy to work collaboratively with others in this House and industry to explore ways in which we can get to that and increase the sustainability of our infrastructure investments. In fact, that's exactly what happened when Labor was last in office. When the Prime Minister held this portfolio, he invested in seed funding to the infrastructure sustainability rating scheme that was established. It was the first one that had ever been established. That's an independent rating framework that's still used to help assess the sustainability of our infrastructure and the performance of our infrastructure across the nation. At the last infrastructure and transport ministers' meeting this was on the agenda. We agreed to explore further how governments across Australia can consider the carbon base case and establish a consistent measurement of embedded carbon within infrastructure projects.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across my portfolio, in terms of both transport and infrastructure, we have a lot we can contribute to net zero. It did surprise me—maybe it won't surprise others here—that there wasn't actually anywhere within the department of infrastructure and transport where we were actually working on net zero and decarbonising the infrastructure and transport portfolio. I have asked my secretary to establish a unit within the department to start doing that. We will be establishing that net zero unit within the portfolio. I'm also undertaking other important initiatives across the portfolio, including the aviation white paper that will look at this issue, and a jet zero council to establish sustainable aviation fuels in this country as well. I thank you for the question and your interest in infrastructure.</span>

I'm very conscious of his longstanding involvement with Campbelltown and Macquarie Fields TAFE, who do a great job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, we need to provide more investment and more resources for the VET sector, and we need to reform the sector so it's fit for purpose to provide the skills our labour market needs, to provide those skills that employers are crying out for and to provide the skills that workers deserve so they can have secure work and they can actually have decent career progression because they have skills that are in demand. Wherever you look across the economy, you see skill shortages. Quite frankly, it is a skills crisis. There are acute shortages in some sectors of the economy. Whether it's aged care, disability care, nurses, GPs, especially in the regions, or the tech industry, they're crying out for more people to fill vacancies. It includes traditional trades, such as boilermakers, electricians and plumbers, and sectors like tourism, hospitality and retail. So there is almost no area of the economy that is not in need of skills supply, and for that reason the government is focusing on that issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a very good start, I think, when, on the first day of the Jobs and Skills Summit, the Prime Minister announced an investment in TAFE: 180,000 fee-free TAFE places for 2023. This is a great announcement, and it was, of course, one that was in partnership with every state and territory government in this country—an agreement that should have been struck well before the election by the previous government if they had been focusing on these issues. Not only will that investment mean that people will be able to afford and access TAFE places in areas of skills shortage; it will, of course, provide a pipeline, a supply of skills to the economy and the labour market, which are so much in need of that supply. That is, of course, critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say too that the fact is that nine out of 10 new jobs over the next five years will require a post-school qualification, whether that's in universities or whether that's in VET. Four of every 10 jobs in the next five years will require at least a vocational qualification. That's why the investment in this area is so important. But, of course, we have to get it right, and that's why we'll establish Jobs and Skills Australia, which will in fact identify the skills shortages that are there now but also, as importantly, identify the emerging areas of demand so that, when we invest billions of dollars, we can supply the skills that are needed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I thank the member for the question, because it is an important topic. After I was sworn in as a minister, I divested myself of shares by transferring them to my husband. On reviewing the code of conduct and after making some additional inquiries, I realised that that was not an adequate form of divestment. My husband and I at all times fully intended to sell the shares. However, I am the first to admit that that should have taken place sooner. I take my responsibilities as a minister very seriously. We have now divested ourselves of all the shares to ensure that there's no conflict of interest. Since the shares are now sold, I consider the matter closed. At no point did I intend to deceive the parliament. I adequately disclosed, as I was required to, unlike those opposite.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:05</span>):  I want to thank the member for Bean for his friendship and his brilliant advocacy for his community. This is a matter which he has raised with me consistently, because it is affecting the people that he represents as well as all of us in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday and Friday of last week the Prime Minister brought together groups of Australians from right across the country, from every possible corner of our country, to talk about some of the issues that matter most to us. Those 140 people came here because, like the rest of Australia, they are desperate to draw a line under a decade in which nothing that really matters to us really got moved forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the people who were in that room have been in conflict for decades. But we heard a really clear message from Australians at the election, and that is, as the Prime Minister said, they want us to get out of the trenches. They want us to work together, because the issues that are facing our constituents are bigger than any of our political parties. It was fantastic to have at the summit people like the Leader of the National Party, there making a contribution, trying to defend and protect the interests of his constituents. The Leader of the Australian Greens was there, the crossbench were there—everyone except those opposite—who are trying to make a difference to this country, together in one conversation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We face a skills crisis, which is very significantly affecting the lives of Australians. We've got nurses in our community who have been pulling double and triple shifts for two years. They just can't do it anymore. We've got a teaching sector, led by my friend the Minister for Education, where teachers are leaving the sector in droves because they just can't put up with the staffing shortages anymore. We've got people in the regional electorates, represented around this chamber, where fruit is rotting on vines because there is no-one to go and pick it and get it onto supermarket shelves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Labor people, our focus is always on trying to get Australians into these jobs. We do face a very special opportunity to bring people who have been marginalised from work into the workforce, and I want to thank the Minister for Social Services for her work on this. But even if we do all of those things, we are going to have a shortfall of labour in this country of many, many thousands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why a decision was made at the summit that this year's permanent skilled migration rate will lift from 160,000 people to 195,000 people. It's going to mean thousands more nurses for our health system in this year. It's going to mean thousands more workers into our regions to help with the acute crises there. It'll mean 31,000 workers to state and territory allocations going straight into our hospitals, our infrastructure projects and our schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I really would have appreciated, and what I think is in the spirit of the moment, is full participation across this chamber. We didn't quite get there, but I want to thank everyone in this chamber who came along, who pulled the weight of the nation with them and worked together to get those great 36 outcomes that we got from the summit.</span>

Australia faces a shortage of workers, particularly women, with experience in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. What is the government doing to increase the diversity of Australians participating in STEM to ensure a better economic future for all Australians?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr HUSIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  Thank you to the member for Hasluck, because she knows, like many of us on this side know, that we need modern skills for a modern economy. We've had—in particular, through the course of the pandemic—a realisation that technology was required by a lot of businesses to keep those businesses running through the pandemic and beyond, and that we need to find ways to build stronger businesses and more secure work that is much more well-paid. To be able to see a lot of that and that productivity occur, we need investment in skills. We also know that countries beyond our shores are investing in technology, big time, because they know what this is doing for their economies and for their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The big thing from our perspective as an incoming government is to be able to provide support to industry. We've got, in particular, our flagship program—the National Reconstruction Fund—which will transform and strengthen industries and look at longer term growth for the economy and, importantly, provide a platform for employment growth. But, coming into government, we're also having to deal with a few things that are holding back the economy. Notably, we've had these decade-long skills shortages affecting science and technology and the types of skills that are required by modern businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we were looking at, over the course of the Jobs and Skills Summit, was how to ensure that we have those investments, like what the Minister for Skills and Training indicated earlier: investments in TAFE and the like; bringing forward those TAFE fee-free places; making sure that we have that pipeline of talent coming in from school, either through vocational education or universities; and making sure, as the Minister for Home Affairs says, that we can tap into global talent and bring that to supplement the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other big thing is that, with the amount of work that we need to do in this space and to address those skills shortages, we need to be able to call on talents from all corners of the community. For the people who had doors shut on them because people didn't have faith in their ability, we need to open those doors up. We need to provide the skills and training and make sure that women, First Nations people, migrants, older workers and those with a disability all have a chance to participate. The great thing that came out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last week was hearing representatives from business, but particularly from the tech sector, saying that they do want to engage in this area. They do want to provide those open pathways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will open up a review in terms of all the STEM programs that exist across government, particularly in my own area, to see what we can do—the programs that are working well, scale them up; the ones that aren't, fold them in—and make sure that we've got the processes in place to widen opportunity. That is what's going to be important, longer term, for this economy: tapping into human capital and skill to drive that growth and strengthen businesses. And we want more Australians to play a part in that very important endeavour.</span>

He was principal private secretary to the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Works from 1958 to 1963. He was then appointed secretary to the Federal Executive Council. Sir David was head of government branch Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from 1971 to 1973. From 1973 through to 1990 he was the official secretary to the Governor-General. It was during this service that he gained public attention, to put it mildly, when, on Remembrance Day 1975, he read the Governor-General's proclamation dismissing Prime Minister Whitlam.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir David was also the inaugural secretary of the Order of Australia from 1975 to 1990, and he helped design Australia's own honours and awards system. He received numerous honours himself, being invested by the Queen as a Commander of the Royal Victorian order in 1977, appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1986 and knighted by the Queen at Balmoral Castle in 1990. After retirement he held several honorary visiting fellow or visiting scholar positions at the Australian National University. He even worked as a volunteer guide at Old Parliament House at the Museum of Australian Democracy, sharing the rich story of Australia democracy and his unique role within it. He was a delegate to the 1998 Constitutional Convention. He was a celebrated and published author. On behalf of the Australian government and on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I pass on our condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.</span>

He was born in 1933 and began his career as a public servant in 1953. He became private secretary to the minister for interior and works in 1958, and he was made the official secretary to then Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck in 1973. He served with great distinction five governors-general, including Sir John Kerr, Sir Zelman Cowen, Sir Ninian Stephen and, of course, Bill Hayden. He was, as the minister pointed out, the official secretary to former Governor-General Sir John Kerr on 11 November 1975, that famous day in Australian political history. He was the man on the steps, the man who read out the proclamation sacking Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir David played a role in the establishment of the Order of Australia and the transition from imperial honours to an Australian honours system. He retired in 1991, and, to his great credit, was a strong supporter for constitutional monarchy. After political life he worked as a volunteer, including, as the minister pointed out, giving guided tours to Old Parliament House. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1990. He served the office and the Commonwealth with great distinction. He is survived by his wife, June, and three sons. May he rest in peace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The urgency of this matter to justify suspension of standing orders is as follows. The intention of the sessional orders agreed at the beginning of the 47th Parliament was that the crossbench get three questions each question time, in line with increased crossbench representation. Even in the short period parliament has been sitting, this is not the way question time has developed. This is urgent because, now, in five of the seven question times so far during this parliament, the crossbench has received only two questions, and only 18 questions were heard today. Each day that passes, therefore, reflects the denial of the opportunity to question the government on important matters relating to the community that elected this crossbench—the largest crossbench of our time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we begin as we plan to continue in this new parliament, rather than allowing poor habits to evolve or simply turning a blind eye to deliberate, mischievous points of order. It is urgent because this is denying crossbenchers the full opportunity to represent our communities in parliament, in one of the few times we get the opportunity to speak up. It is on that basis that I put this motion.</span>

The 47th Parliament has the largest crossbench yet seen in this House, reflecting the fact that one-third of Australians voted for a representative who was independent from the major parties at the most recent federal election. The millions of Australians who make up our electorates have expressed a desire to see politics done differently. As a new member of parliament, I have been disappointed by the opposition's frequent interruptions and stonewalling in question time in the first sitting fortnight of this parliament. The opposition's points of order are pointless. The time we have here is precious. It is expensive. It should be valued. We hold the trust of the public that we use this time effectively and responsibly. Our electorates want and deserve better than the time wasted in question time. We wish to facilitate a more productive question time in which the important and pressing issues of our time can be discussed in detail and with respect. This country needs an effective opposition and question time needs to include real questions and real answers. The interests of our individual electorates will be better served by a redistribution of questions such as to increase the ability of this crossbench to hold the government to account.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I inform the House that the opposition became aware of this proposed suspension of standing orders around 2.15 today, when the member for Goldstein approached me to provide me with notice of that, and I thank her for doing that. I was then informed that the government intends to support this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just weeks ago the government made changes to the standing orders, through the normal process, to add standing order 65A, which aims to set out a set of new and modified arrangements to deal with the fact that we do have a different composition in this parliament than we have had previously. Standing order 65A, amongst other things, is predicated on the assumption that there will be—when you work through the maths—22 questions, because it refers to a crossbench member seeking the call on the fifth, on the 13th and on the 21st questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Goldstein has rightly said, in fact, today the Prime Minister brought question time to an end after 18 questions. And in the several question times in the last sitting period we saw the Prime Minister bring question time to an end after 18 or 20 questions. We've had conduct from the government which is different from the premise on which it drafted standing order 65A, brought it to the House and secured the support of the House for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make no criticism of the crossbench for bringing this motion forward today, but I do say that these are matters within the control of the government. Given the conduct that we have seen from the Prime Minister today and in several question times in the last sitting period, where the Prime Minister shut down questions after 18 or indeed 20 questions, unless the Prime Minister changes his practices, the practical impact of what is put before the House today—let's be in no doubt about it—will be one less question for the opposition and one more question for the crossbench.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the House, and I say particularly to the government, that this is not an exercise of good faith by the government. The government just weeks ago set out a set of arrangements in the standing orders. There were extensive discussions between all of the parties: government, opposition and crossbench. There were a whole range of discussions on these matters. We did raise concerns with a number of them, but the government set out a set of arrangements, and that has now been set out in the standing orders. Literally a week or two later, in terms of sitting weeks that have elapsed, the government is now proposing, as I'm advised, to support a material change to those arrangements, which will have the practical effect of reducing by one question the number of questions that the opposition receives and increasing by one the number of questions that the crossbench receives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I make no criticism of the crossbench. I do criticise the government. This is not the way that the government should be engaging with the opposition. We've heard a lot about kinder, gentler politics; we've heard a lot about a more cooperative and consultative approach. This is the very opposite of that. This is being done with absolutely no notice to the opposition and the practical effect of it is to reduce by one the number of questions that the opposition is able to ask.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Prime Minister that he could resolve this issue simply by committing that he will maintain a practice of having 22 questions, which is the basis on which standing order 65A was drafted. The opposition will oppose this motion on the practical grounds that its substantive effect is to reduce the number of questions that we receive. The government could very simply solve this issue by committing to having 22 questions in question time.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  That was a valiant defence of the sessional order the opposition voted against. That's what we just had. The Manager of Opposition Business is right that the sessional order presumes we'll get through 22 questions, which most of the time we used to when we got to the normal finishing time of 10 past three. What has happened this term is, because the only question they feel is at stake is the crossbench question, they take point of order after point of order to slow everything down and they don't lose a question. It has always actually been a natural restraint on oppositions that you would feel, if you kept the points of order going, you were going to lose a question at the other end. That would cause oppositions to hold back. On this occasion what they've done is decide, 'Well, it's only the crossbench that's at stake, therefore we'll do points of order.' We had four on one question today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of this will be really simple. If the number of points of order goes back to normal, the opposition will get all the questions that they had every right to expect. But effectively what this change to the sessional order does is say the commitment that was publicly given to the crossbench that they would get three questions is what will ordinarily now occur. That's what this says—and it says, for the commitments that were made to the opposition, it's very much up to you. There is only one reason we're getting through so few questions, and that's in the hands of the Manager of Opposition Business.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  When I came into parliament as a member of the National Party government, in three months I got no questions at all. Now every two or three weeks I get a question. When I did get the question, the whip came down and said, 'You've got a question today, Katter,' and he gave me the question. I said: 'That's got nothing to do with my electorate. I'm not interested in that. What're you giving me that for?' and he said, 'That's the question you're asking.' I said: 'Hold on a minute, am I to understand that the only way I get to stand up and ask questions in this place is if I'm a mouthpiece and a little puppet on a string for you? Is that the way it works?' and he said, 'Yes, that's the way it works.' What we're asking for is a more enlightened approach than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question time was cut short because I had question 21, and the Prime Minister was a bit scared of it; I know that. He's a good bloke. Peter Andren and Ted Mack, the fathers of the third force in politics, said on their first re-election, the first time that a third-party person had ever gotten re-elected, 'The only questions that will be asked in this place will be asked by those of us on the crossbenches, because they are the only meaningful questions.' One side throws banana skins in front of the government, and the government tell us how wonderful they are, which bores the entire Australian public silly. I want to thank both of them, because that's the reason we're here. It sure would be nice if we gave a bit of return on their money to the taxpayers of Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in moving urgency, the intention of the sessional orders agreed at the beginning of the 47th Parliament was to provide the crossbench with three questions in question time. It has not worked. In five of the seven question times since the 47th Parliament began, the crossbench has only been able to ask two questions and not the agreed three.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There appears to have been the deliberate use of points of order to waste time to deny the crossbench the 21st question. For members of the crossbench, asking questions without notice is a key tool to hold government to account. Such tactical approaches to reducing the agreed number of questions is cynical and thwarts the agreement between the government, crossbench and, indeed, the opposition on questions. The agreement is not being treated with good faith by the opposition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is designed to restore the original intention of the sessional order that would be in line with the numbers in the House—the government, opposition, Greens and crossbench. This may seem like a small numerical change, but, if we are to be truly representative, it'll make a big difference for the communities that this crossbench represent. All of us on this crossbench may wish for greater reform of question time, but this is a start. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

The Australian people deserve better from their parliament. They want and expect better from question time. They're disappointed with the rancour and the uselessness of many of the points of order that are raised by the opposition. They want the government to answer questions, rather than asking themselves pointless questions and wasting everyone's time with those. We can do better and we should do better.</span>

I have been here for a little bit longer than some of my crossbench colleagues, but I stand united with them on this issue. The people of Australia are sick of question time. It is performative politics really at its worst. We see mind-numbing dorothy dixers. We see mischievous points of order. The people of Australia demand some transparency and accountability from their parliament, and question time is a time to get that, if we take it seriously.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on the crossbench seek real answers to real questions. We are the biggest crossbench since Federation and we undertook an agreement with the sessional orders to have proportional representation at question time. That's not being fulfilled because of many parts of this awful performative politics that is question time—not just mischievous points of order, not just mind-numbing dorothy dixers, not just question time being cut short by the Prime Minister, but all of it combined.</span>

We can do better, and one way of doing better is making sure that the crossbench get their proportional representation at question time by backing the member for Goldstein. I call on everyone in this parliament to do better and to support this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  The reality is that it's not proportional representation if the Independents get one question and we get two every question time. The reality is that we have about five times as many members as them. The Greens are almost in coalition with Labor, so they've got 12. We've got 58. The reality is that the people in my electorate in Petrie and right around the country expect us to be a very well accounted for opposition, and, if we're not getting questions, how do we hold the government to account?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would expect better from the member for Indi and the member for Mayo and the member for Kennedy and all those members that have been here for some time. The reality is that in my time in this parliament—and I've been here for four terms; three terms in government, the first time in opposition—every member that's come in here and spoken today hasn't been here before. They weren't here when Labor has been in opposition. They weren't here for the points of order that Labor raised, the change in standing orders and the motions moved against the government in the last two terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really not fair for Australians if we have one question from Independents and then, more or less, two questions from the opposition: The opposition should be getting more questions than that. The Labor Party and the Manager of Government Business shouldn't be supporting this motion. They should be making sure that the opposition gets its fair share of questions and, if they don't want to do that, the Prime Minister should sit question time longer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember that, in the last term, in the 46th Parliament, during COVID, the member for Cook, the former Prime Minister, would quite often have question time going through to about 20 to four. Question time did not end at 10 past three; it went from 2.00 to 3.30 and often 2.00 to 3.40 to make sure those questions were answered. So really, for all Australians listening, this is not good for democracy. It isn't representational of the 151 members in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people know that the Greens are more or less part of the Labor Party, and that leaves 12 independents. When I look over there, I count maybe one or two of them who perhaps would sit with our side of the parliament. The other 10, through their contributions here today and their reflections on the opposition, really have shown their true colours, and the people of Kooyong and other seats need to be aware that their members are supporting the Labor Party, will continue to support the Labor Party and are not really true Independents. They're also not grassroots members. Through their language, through the way they behave and through their reflections on the opposition, they wouldn't have the slightest clue of what it means to be down here with the people. I'll be really interested to see how these guys go at the next election—</span>

                  </a>  because the reality is that this is not fair. It's not right. It weakens our democracy. The Prime Minister gets up and talks about the Westminster system, but he wants to change it so the opposition doesn't get its proportional representation of questions. The fact is that they have about 20 per cent of what we have. They should be getting one in every six questions, and the government wants to support them in weakening the voices of the opposition to suit themselves. It's just not on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I heard the words expressed by the member for Indi. Being in my second-term, I do support and agree with some of the statements that have been made by the opposition as well as some of the statements made by the member for Goldstein. I say that the spirit and intent of standing order 65(a) was on the assumption that question time would go to 3.30, which it routinely did in the previous parliament, and it has been cut short in this parliament to date. It was on the assumption that there are 22 questions in the parliament, which is, again, what often occurred in the previous parliament. Both sides of politics have on numerous occasions used question time to interrupt and delay. There was suspension of standing orders during the previous parliament by the now government. There are now multiple points of order. In the last parliament, the Speakers enforced that there would be only one point of order per question. Maybe it is a way of returning to a prompt and more effective use of question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In representing a community, I should say the community does want question time to be more effective. You are kidding yourselves if you don't think the public watches this and cares. We are wasting the public's time and money when it is all show and not a genuine questioning of government. We have now had over 100 days since the election, and this is our eighth sitting day. We are here to hold the government to account and ask serious questions. It is important, and it is important that we have proportional representation here in questions. I support the motion because we haven't been getting to proportional representation. The crossbench is 22 per cent of the opposition and, as such, there is a third question, but I would urge the government to have a proper sitting of question time to ensure that we have a full length of questions occurring.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That standing order 97 be amended by the addition of a new paragraph, standing order 97(c), to read as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is demonstrably a matter of urgency. We have just had a change to the standing orders made on the basis of a series of arguments put by the Leader of the House and, indeed, by the crossbench, which argued that it's been the conduct of the opposition—it was said—which meant there had been a reduction in the effective number of questions that members of the crossbench were able to ask. I make the point, and I do this without any criticism of the crossbench, that the first time this was put to the opposition was at approximately 2.15 this afternoon. here was no consultation with the opposition from the crossbench. More seriously, there was no consultation with the opposition from the government. The Leader of the House made no attempt to raise this matter with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have explained to the House, the practical consequence of the change which has just been made is that there will be a reduction in the effective number of questions which are open to the opposition to ask every day. Standing order 65(a) is predicated on the assumption that there will be 22 questions. But the fact is that the conduct we've seen from the government and from the Prime Minister is, typically, that question time is being brought to an end after 20 questions or after 18 questions. Indeed, today, question time was brought to an end after 18 questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I emphasise that the opposition and the crossbench have a shared interest in scrutiny. We have a shared interest in accountability. The crossbench are here to represent the interests of their constituents. The opposition are here to represent the interests of our constituents. Indeed, in a Westminster system there is a very strong interest in the government being subject to the day-to-day scrutiny of an informed opposition and of an informed crossbench. I think we have a shared interest in as much practical and effective scrutiny as there can be of the government of the day. If we look at what has been one of the direct causes of the concern that the crossbench has raised, and I acknowledge the concern, it is that standing order 65(a) drafted by the government—drafted by the Leader of the House—is premised on the expectation that there will be 22 questions in question time. What we have in fact seen in practice is that question time is being brought to an end by the Prime Minister after 20 questions or after 18 questions. As has been pointed out by my colleague the member for Petrie, who is a student of these matters—all on this side of the House are students of these matters—we have seen from the behaviour of the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, a very strong commitment to question time going for a period that, in practical terms, has been considerably longer than has been the regrettable practice of the current Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I say to you, but more importantly I say to every member of this House: on the opposition side and on the crossbench side we have a shared interest in scrutiny. We have a shared interest in holding this government to account. Our constituents ask us to do that. As to the solution that has been put forward and the change to the standing orders that has just been made by the House—and, again, I must express my regret that there was not a proper opportunity for consultation with the opposition—I say particularly to the crossbench: my door is always open. Our doors are open and we welcome every opportunity to sit down with you, brainstorm these issues and find a way to make our parliament work more effectively in seeking answers to questions from government. We seek to do that on behalf of the Australian people and consistent with what has been the historical role of opposition throughout the Westminster system, referred to for centuries as 'Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition'. That is an important role. It's an important role in our system and, regrettably, it can sometimes be the case that prime ministers—perhaps new prime ministers—can find that scrutiny a little unappealing and a little unattractive. But it's not about how people feel, whether people like it or not, it's about its importance to the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an urgency to this matter. The reason that standing orders should be suspended is that we have just made a change to the standing orders which bears quite significantly on the operation of question time and on how effective it will be as a means of holding the government to account. I acknowledge the concerns that have been raised by the crossbench but I also welcome comments, including from, for example, the member for Warringah, who, in her observations, noted that she felt that some of what the opposition had said had substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So in effect we have before us a partial solution to a clear problem. The problem we have is that the government said there would be 22 questions, and the government said that there would be an allocation of those questions under a certain ratio, under a certain formula, as between the opposition and the crossbench. We made arguments vigorously as to whether we thought that formula or that allocation was right, but in good faith. We've worked under that allocation once it came into effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate, I think, that this government's attempts to deal with this issue—and it is a novel issue; I and the opposition acknowledge that it is a novel issue—have proved to be wanting so early in the life of this parliament. It's particularly unfortunate that a key trigger for the problem here—the reason why the government's attempts to deal with this issue have not worked—has been the conduct of the Prime Minister himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have put—and we say this is a matter of urgency that the House needs to consider now—is effectively the second half of the solution. Let's put two halves together and make a whole. What we're proposing is that, if one part of the solution has been a change in the respective sequencing of questions being asked by the opposition and by the crossbench, another part of the holistic solution here needs to be that we look at the total length of question time. We've been pretty reasonable in what we've proposed. We could have proposed that question time go, for example, to four o'clock or even to five o'clock, but we've proposed, quite reasonably, 3.30. It is not without precedent at all that question time go to 3.30.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I say to you and I say to the House: this matter is urgent because of the changes that have just been made to the standing orders. It is unfortunate that the opposition was notified of those extremely late, but we've put on our thinking caps. We've thought with alacrity and good heart about how we can come up with a holistic solution to the issue that the parliament presently faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That holistic solution is the one embodied in the motion that I am now proposing: that standing orders be suspended so I am able to move the motion that standing order 97 would be amended by the addition of a standing order 97(c), which would say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Question time must not be concluded before 3.30 pm each day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that would do is allow a satisfactory minimum period of time for question time to occur. We would be very open to it continuing later should that be the government's judgement. I suspect it won't be, but we'd be very open to it. This is a practical solution which addresses both the legitimate concerns that the crossbench have raised and the legitimate concerns that the opposition have raised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's unfortunate that we've seen a little bit of game playing from the government and some of those experiences from backroom Labor politics on display today. But we're saying: let's join together for a kinder, gentler parliament where we can work together to achieve outcomes for our constituents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I second the motion, and I'll make a brief contribution because we've got very important business to deal with in the House—two speeches that we're all sitting here very anxious to listen to. But this is an important issue that needs to be resolved before the House can move on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to deal with a couple of points. Firstly, the arrangement that the honourable member spoke of, the amendment to the standing orders, essentially reduced from 10 to eight the number of questions that the opposition could put to the government in this parliament. That was quite a departure from the practice over many, many parliaments. It was driven by the inclusion of the crossbench members, and I acknowledge that; that's fine. But there is nothing to this argument about the proportionality, though—that's the first point. The member for Petrie rightly pointed out that the numbers here in the opposition are 58, and that is roughly five times the numbers on the crossbench. So there's nothing to that argument. It's a facilitation of the crossbench. The government came to an agreement—at about the same time they cut all their staff, of course—that they would have an arrangement in place where the crossbenchers could ask questions. We're in support of that, and we have made that point clear today. But the reality is that we are now moving beyond that to a point that wasn't contemplated initially, and that is to reduce, in effect, from eight to seven questions the number that the opposition can put to the government of the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this were an aboveboard action, if this were something that the government were proud of, if this were something that, in concert with the crossbenchers, was done transparently, if we had have been advised of this cosy arrangement before question time, not during question time, that would have been a different scenario. There might have been some legitimacy to what is being argued here. But that's not what's being argued. The argument around there somehow being a conspiracy by the opposition to pad out question time so that those members on the crossbench couldn't achieve their third question I will just deal with, as it is complete nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met in good faith with each of the members of the crossbench. I extended to them an opportunity to speak with me on issues that are important to them. Not one of them has taken up the opportunity to raise this issue with me. That's because it is not a legitimate criticism. We haven't raised points of order here to try and exclude their opportunity to ask another question of the government. What interest would we have in that? We're happy for questions to be asked of the government. We think they're a bad government. Whether it is us, the Greens or the Independents asking questions of the government, I am fine with all of that. So to suggest, which is the point that the member for Goldstein made, that somehow the legitimacy of her point here and her secret agreement with the government is to try and deal with an issue of our making is a complete nonsense. I am not going to stand for it. I am not going to be besmirched in that way. It is not genuine. If it were a genuine concern that the member for Goldstein or, indeed, the member for Kooyong had, they would have come to see me and raised it. I have said to them that I have an open door in relation to any issues that they have. There's been not a peep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we hear about transparency and we hear about new conduct, a new parliament and a new way of behaving and conducting ourselves, that's not been on display here today. We have seen a government that saw this coming. The manager of government business is an experienced hand. He saw them coming a mile away. What did they come with? They came with an argument that we, as an opposition, would be able to ask one less question of the government. Why wouldn't they take it up? What happens in the circumstance where, as today, there was a condolence motion at the beginning of question time? To the government's credit, today it extended beyond 3 pm to accommodate the time that was taken for the condolence motion in relation to Mikhail Gorbachev. That was an appropriate extension today, but that is not anything other than a discretion exercised or not by the government of the day. That hasn't been accommodated for in the proposition from the honourable members of the crossbench today. There's nothing in the standing orders that says that the government must, when a proper condolence motion is considered by this House, extend question time beyond 3.10, which would be the appropriate way to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think there is a lot of reflection to take place here. The government are not going to allow this motion to get up. They will seek to close it down. But I think it is a very poor reflection on those members who have contributed in a way that misrepresents what this is really about today.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition just referred to the mathematics, the numbers not being true. Could I just draw his attention to this. He said that the numbers of the opposition are five times those of the crossbench. There are 16 on the crossbench. If you multiply that by five, that means you're in government; it means you've got 80 members in the House. That's what they just said. There are 16 on the crossbench, and the proportionality that's reflected in the sessional order does presume we should get to 22 questions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would simply warn those considering this motion about one of the impacts that will definitely come from what the Manager of Opposition Business has moved. Effectively, if part of what the House just voted on was about having an incentive that we don't spend as much time on endless points of order, what this is saying is: push off the finish time, and then the opposition can keep behaving exactly as they have, with absolutely nothing to provide any extra layer of discipline.

                <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2011, the first complete year of the 43rd Parliament, following the introduction of restrictions on duration of questions and answers, it has been about 70 minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the normal length of time for question time. The Leader of the Opposition is right, though: it's right and proper that there be extensions, whenever possible, at the end when there have been significant indulgences at the start. That is something that should happen. But the 70-minute concept simply has the impact that you get 11 questions each side, because some questions are a bit shorter and some answers are a bit shorter. History has been that you get 11 questions each side if you don't stall the whole day with points of order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's what changes as a result of what the opposition have put: either way, we get a situation where, if the opposition want to get all 11 questions, it's on them to raise only points of order that are genuine points of order. If we do the extension, if this motion is carried, then what we saw today and what we saw on the previous days on which this parliament has sat—where you get four points of order in the course of a single question, and it goes on and on and on—will be continued. I don't think that's consistent with the aspirations that people have for this parliament, and I'd urge people to vote against it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you to my children, who have come back, and for everyone's patience. I really appreciate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I address this House with gratitude for what has been and a sense of duty for what we have to do. Menzies is an electorate from the great southern city of Melbourne. It is an electorate named after the founder of the Liberal Party and our longest serving Prime Minister. Few in history get to shape the destiny of a nation. Robert Menzies was one of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the community I am here to represent: 170,000 people, 50,000 families, 44 schools, small shops, places of worship, sporting clubs, Scouts, Rotaries, volunteers and carers—each a Victorian, each an Australian. This is and always will be about them. They have placed their trust in me, and in return I owe them my best effort and selfless judgment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the people who are sitting in the gallery and watching at home. You are my party, my supporters, my friends, my family. I would not be here without you. Before I sit I hope to properly thank you through words, and before this all ends I hope to properly thank you through deeds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two others have come before me: Neil Brown and Kevin Andrews. Both served with distinction as members and ministers. Kevin had the added honour of being the Father of the House. I thank them both for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always loved maps. I remember turning the first page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hobbit</span> and staring at that sketch of the Lonely Mountain. To me, maps represent landscapes of adventures gone and adventures to come. If you look closely at the map of Menzies, you will see both dense development and wide open shades of green. You will see a place where the city meets the country. My party is at its best when it is a voice for both. The Yarra River, save for one exception, is our northern boundary; from Warrandyte to Wonga Park, to Templestowe and to Bulleen, the Yarra has been a sanctuary like no other. For thousands of years it was a meeting place and provider of food. The Wurundjeri people call it Birrarung, meaning 'river of mists and shadows'. From the First Australians to the first find of gold and to the darker days of the pandemic, the Yarra has been a source of prosperity, happiness and solace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you follow the Yarra west you will find the Heide Museum of Modern Art. It occupies the site of a former dairy farm. Young painters flocked to Heide, including Sidney Nolan, John Percival, Albert Tucker and Joy Hester. The original farmhouse still stands, and in the living room hangs one of Nolan's Ned Kelly paintings. It's a series he created in that very room. And outside the kitchen stands a giant oak tree, under which Sarah and I were married.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you move through the suburbs of Doncaster, Donvale, Park Orchards, Box Hill, Blackburn, Nunawading and Mitcham, contours in our landscape give way to the diversity of people. Almost 70 per cent of the people of Menzies are first- or second-generation migrants. Each has a story that began in another country. I am one of them. I was born in Ireland, to young and loving parents. Mum helped support us by working late nights, managing a bar. That meant dad got us to sleep with stories. The ones we liked the most were about his travels, and one place stood out: dad spoke of a land that was full of adventure, beauty and opportunity. It was clear to us that he had fallen in love with Australia and was sure that we would, too. And so in 1988 we landed in Melbourne, with our first night at the Nunawading Motor Inn—a motel that sits within the seat of Menzies. Both my parents worked hard. Dad started his own roof-plumbing business and mum worked for a small company that assembled electronic exit signs. My parents encouraged us to put our hands up to speak and to serve. All of those opportunities were there for me at Ringwood Secondary College, a wonderful public school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Henry Kissinger once said: 'Don't be too ambitious. Do the most important thing you can think of and your career will take care of itself.' For a long time the most important thing I could think of was getting into law school and becoming a barrister. Then, one night, Sandra Sully broke the news of a plane crash in New York. What was previously important suddenly wasn't. I was moved by a speech that the British Prime Minister delivered days later, where he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is a moment to seize. The Kaleidoscope has been shaken. The pieces are in flux. Soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us re-order this world around us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had already qualified as an officer in the reserves and had recently passed commando selection. I was now determined to complete that training and get to Afghanistan before the pieces settled again. Little did I know how long that would take and how much it would impact my life. I qualified as a commando and deployed to that country three times. My greatest honour was leading a platoon of Australian soldiers in combat. They were brave, they were kind and they did Australia proud. I have recently learned that for a brief period in October 2009, the members for Herbert, Canning and Menzies were all deployed to Afghanistan at the same time.  am proud to serve with them again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a duty here to take stock of our longest war. The stocktake starts with a solemn truth: that young Australians of every generation are capable of the most extraordinary bravery and sacrifice, that behind each of the 102,000 names on our War Memorial is a family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marcus Case and Greg Sher were my friends from 2 Commando Company and were killed in Afghanistan. In the gallery is Marcus's closest friend Matt Rowland, who now teaches here in Canberra. I'm honoured to have Marcus's parents, Bernard and Lee, as constituents. Also here are Greg Sher's parents, Felix and Yvonne, and brother Barry. You too once called Menzies home after migrating from South Africa. Next to you is a good friend, Jeremy Lanzer, and I know watching from home are those who loved him and were with him when he died, including my friend Andrew James.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One night after a long day of pre-poll, Barry turned to me after I thanked him and he said this: 'I'll never ask you for anything, but, whenever you can, say his name.' And in that moment I learnt something about the words 'lest we forget'. It is more than a line at the end of a Kipling poem; it is a heartfelt plea, a plea to let those whose lives were cut short live on, to let their memory be a national blessing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stocktake must also preference truth-telling over myth-making. From the allegations in the Brereton report to the fall of Kabul, we have a duty to face up to all that happened. Twenty-one years later, we can fairly ask: how did we reorder the world around us? If we answer that question with humility then we will recognise the limits of military power alone. If we answer that question with honesty then we will have demonstrated that ours is an open and accountable democracy. That is something worth fighting for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not come here to make a career; I have come here to make a difference. Moved by gratitude, I have not come here to tear down institutions but to nourish them. Moved by duty, I have not come to act in my interest but in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be tested, and we will make decisions. You are entitled to know how I will find my way. When you look to a map to guide you, there is a choice to be made. Shall I use magnetic north or true north? Magnetic north is easily distracted, including by devices. From time to time you may find yourself with a crowd but you might be lost. True north is a fixed point and never shifts, even if you find yourself standing alone. My true north will always be family and the values of free enterprise and individual freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it another way, I believe in democratising prosperity and democratising power, to making sure the spirit of happiness resides in the people, that we trust them to assess risk, that we trust them to speak their mind so that the accident of birth will never be the dominant factor in whether a person makes it or not. These are the dreams of opportunity that drive people to come here, to ache for control of their own lives. They are not values to be junked in times of emergency, whether it be war or pandemic. They are values to double down on when our nation is tested, and I believe they play a key role in keeping us safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a child of the eighties, I remember a moment when the cartoon I was watching was interrupted with a newsflash. I thought, 'This was how we find out war has come and humanity ends.' It should concern us that in 2022 the risk of conflict is closer to midnight. We have a duty to respond, to ensure that our military power has the sting of a bee, to build an industry that is resilient—one that has the structure of a hive—and to honour our alliances and stand by our friends. It is at this point that students of strategy and history may ask, 'What about the security dilemma?' If our adversaries feel insecure, then we will be insecure. If we act, they will counteract. This is not a dilemma to ignore. The path to World War I should never be forgotten. But we should analyse the source of that insecurity. It is not that liberal democracy will destroy nations; it is that we exist. When viewed this way, their counteraction is to throw sand in the gears of democratic systems, to feed off our own distrust in democratic institutions. That is why the way we practise democracy matters. The power of our example is a strategic asset. We will be safer if we believe that ours is a nation worth fighting for. Right now, that self-belief is in need of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every four years the US National Intelligence Council publishes the <span style="font-style:italic;">Global trends</span> report. It is intended to provide a review of shared global challenges. One observation stands out: our task is made harder by the division of society into identity affiliations. It is a paradox that at the very time we have grown more connected through technology that very connectivity has divided us. People are gravitating to information silos, where beliefs are reinforced and truth is subjective. This fragmentation has in part led to a gap between what people demand and what governments can deliver. Trapped in our silos, we are tempted to exaggerate our own virtue and see the other as a cartoon villain. This is not healthy for our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me step out of my silo. The census told us many things about ourselves, including that the cohort born between 1981 and 1996 are now our largest generation. I once looked that generation in the eye and asked them to do things that meant they might not live to see 30. I know they are called orders, but that is not why they acted. They did their duty because they believe in this country, and that is a belief I intend to repay. I want to look them in the eye and say that integrity does matter. We may find it in institutions, and we will have that debate, but it must always reside in the hearts of the people we send here and be reflected in what we do, not what we say. I want to look them in the eye and say that, when it comes to the environment, living off the dividends and not the principle is a value every generation should aspire to. I want to look them in the eye and say democratising prosperity is about you. It is about taking less of your pay as tax, feeling confident to open your own business, making firms compete for you and not rent-seek with us, and government living within its means so you can expand yours. I want to look them in the eye and say that homeownership is core business for my party. But we have urgent work to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Robert Menzies who spoke in the darkest days of World War II not just of the forgotten people but of what every generation desires—a home of their own 'to which we can withdraw and in which we can be among our friends'. But I have a plea in return—to join more things. Join a Rotary. Join the Country Fire Authority. Coach a sporting team. Run the sausage sizzle. And maybe even join a political party. If you do, you will see firsthand that the democratisation of power is not a gift from above but the proper design of a society that is driven by people who have the courage to turn up. If you choose my party, you won't find a box for 'moderate' or a box for 'conservative'. You will find a movement that welcomes you with open arms, that can be proud of its history and learn from its mistakes—one that has a true north of principle over power, of hope over anguish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do I possibly do justice to the people who turned up for me? To those who fought for party democracy: you demonstrated that values are meaningless unless we practise them. To the preselection delegates: thank you for placing your trust in me. To the late Hal Grix, who showed me what it is like to live a life of service; to the people who donated; to my field officers; to my staff; to the secretariat, led by Sam McQuestin and Robert Clark; and to my campaign team, led by Stephen Carter and Ian Quick: thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The volunteers bled blue and have surnames I'm proud to say reflect our community. Let me give you some: from Jurcevic to Eminagov to Jakupi, from Wooldridge to Reinehr to Italiano, from Harvey to Tang to Hegde, from Smith to Fakhri to Lam, from Ryan to Roy to Rixon, from Beraldo to De Stefano to Grivokostopoulos, from Palmer to Khoury to Kounelis, from White to Dyson to Oberoi, from Drivas to Lai to Dell'Orso, from Kelly to Pyrros to Barr, from Davies to Gilmour to Connolly, from Greenstein to Mirabella to Byrne, and from Diamante to Dimitroff to Dawei—and so many more. Ours was a grassroots movement too, and I will never forget it. </span>

I'm grateful to have shared this journey with the members for Casey, Flinders, Hughes and Bowman, as well as my friend Senator Paterson. And if we ever lose our map, let us stand at the main entrance. At that point you will see a road that draws a long line to names on a wall. These are the names of Australians who traded all their tomorrows so that we may have today. These are the names that take me back to that newsflash in 1986. It didn't break to news of war.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  It is an honour to rise for the first time in this chamber to make a contribution to the address-in-reply. The opening of a new parliament and the Governor-General's address signify renewal and continuity in equal measure. It is a celebration of both the contemporary and of the enduring. We welcome new members and a new government against the backdrop of centuries-old parliamentary tradition. While our own parliament is relatively young, Australia is in fact one of the world's oldest continuing democracies and, by any assessment, we are one of the most successful nations on earth. But our prosperity, security and stability are not delivered by good fortune or divine providence. Our success has been the product of the industriousness of our citizens, the strength of our institutions and the bravery of our service men and women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm humbled by the incredible honour I've been given by my community to represent them here in the 47th Parliament. But I'm also conscious of the great threat that lies ahead for our nation and the responsibility that falls on all of us in this place to ensure we maintain and accelerate our Commonwealth's extraordinary success. Edmund Burke, one of the great intellectual fathers of conservatism, wrote of society as a partnership not just between the living, but between those who are living, those who have passed and those who are yet to be born. All Australians owe a great debt to the previous generations from whom we have inherited this great nation. Those of us in this chamber have a colossal duty to ensure we pass it on to the next generation in a position of even greater strength and prosperity. My mission, as the member for Bowman, will be to ensure that we live up to our end of Burke's societal partnership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The division of Bowman is named after David Bowman, who led the Queensland Labor Party to state election defeats in 1907, 1908, 1909 and 1912. Mr Bowman is not a household name, but any political leader who had to endure the indignity of four general election defeats in five years deserves the honour of having a seat in this place named in their honour! The division of Bowman perfectly aligns within the boundaries of the Redlands local government area. Without wishing to offend the memory of the unlucky Mr Bowman, it will be my practice to refer to my community in this place as the Redlands—the same way we refer to ourselves at home. The Redlands denotes the rich red soil of Southern Moreton Bay between Tingalpa Creek and the Logan River, the land east of Mount Cotton, out across the water to Stradbroke Island, including the beautiful islands of Southern Moreton Bay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For thousands of years, this land was the home to the Ngugi, Noonuccal and Koenpul tribes. In 1799, Matthew Flinders became the first European to enter Moreton Bay, and over the subsequent decades the Redlands became home to settlers undertaking many different pioneering industries. It played an important role in the start of Australia's sugar industry and it was home to our first ever commercial sugar mill. For over a century, the villages of the Redlands became centres of primary production, described as the salad bowl of South-East Queensland. Rich farmland has now largely given way to suburbs, but the small-town character remains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having grown up in an Air Force family, I've lived in many cities around Australia and overseas and I know that there's something very special about the Redlands. It's more than just our beautiful environment. The Redlands is a community of people who care about each other, and it's a community that's been forged in an aspirational and pioneering spirit. This is the spirit that drove the first Koenpul man to paddle out across to North Stradbroke Island. It's the spirit that drove the pioneers of agriculture in the Redlands, and today it is the driving force that inspires a young couple to break out and form their own gym in Capalaba, start a new restaurant at Wellington Point or even buy a new home in Redland Bay. Those who have moved to the Redlands seek new opportunities to achieve prosperity and establish a better life for themselves and their families. In many ways, the Redlands embodies the values of mainstream Suburban Australia, values I sought and received a mandate to represent in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't make any apologies for being a social conservative and an economic liberal, and in that philosophical outlook I believe in the embodiment of what Sir Robert Menzies sought to bring together in forming the Liberal Party of Australia: the conservative tradition, which seeks to protect our inherited customs, traditions and institutions; and the liberal tradition, which advances free markets, individual liberty and small government, but, critically, big reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My beliefs have been shaped by my life's experiences and the values that were instilled in me as a product of my family's long connection with this remarkable country. My family's story is a saga that seems to have placed us in the thick of some of our nation's worst disasters and greatest moments of triumph. I have great-grandfathers who fought in Gallipoli, one of whom went on to be written up by Charles Bean as a hero of Villers-Bretonneux. My grandfather fought in North Africa, Syria and New Guinea. My father spent 35 years in the Air Force, and other family members achieved great attainments in peacetime as teachers, cane farmers, bankers, authors, carpenters and, in the finest endeavour of all, raising children in a loving home. From my family I learnt the value of good, honest hard work. I learnt that sacrifice is needed to get ahead. I learnt the importance of service and a strong sense of Australia's national purpose. I've learnt that the most important work being done in this country is not done within this building but within the four walls of the Australian home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My values have also been shaped by my own professional experience. Prior to coming here, I built a career as a policy specialist and an industry advocate, fighting to remove obstacles to investment and job creation on behalf of some of Australia's most critical sectors, including property, agriculture and the automotive industry. I've seen many bad policy ideas, new taxes and burdensome regulations. I've seen how they get dreamt up, I've seen how they come to fruition and I've seen the very real impact that they have on Australian businesses, Australian workers and Australian mum-and-dad investors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I reflect today on my own experiences and the past of my family, I imagine the sort of nation that our next generations will inherit. I want to take this opportunity, probably the only opportunity I'll have to speak in this place without being howled down, to outline what I want to work towards while I'm here—or, hopefully, over on the other side at some point in the future!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The guiding principle of my approach to public policy is the sovereignty of the individual. We are sent here by the Australian people to serve them, not the other way around. Australia is great because her people are great, and Australia is at her greatest, at her most just and at her most prosperous when individuals are allowed to flourish without the long arm of government creating unnecessary obstacles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More government is too often the prescription that's offered for the problems our society faces. Too often, government programs are assessed on their expenditure and their intentions, as opposed to their value for money and their results. The revenue the federal government collects through the laws passed in this chamber belongs to the Australian people. They have worked hard for it. Every dollar we take, every law we pass and every new regulation imposed comes at a very real cost. So far this decade, Australians have endured an unprecedented increase in government interference in their daily lives and a sharp erosion in their individual freedoms. We have been left with a more divided society and an intergenerational debt that will weigh us down for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that we have to recast the relationship between government and the governed in this country, and core to that is respecting the inherent rights of the individual. Every single human life is sacred. We are all made in the image of God. Every Australian has the capacity to make a significant contribution to our economy and our society. It is in the national interest that every Australian be given the opportunity to reach their fullest potential, but our people are being held back by heavy regulations, inefficient taxes and bloated bureaucracies. I want to use my experience and my knowledge of industry to help reshape the economic narrative in this country. We can supercharge Australia's growth trajectory, but to do so we have to have an appetite for some big, bold reforms and to continue to lower taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, Prime Minister Rudd commissioned the Henry tax review as a root-and-branch review of Australia's tax system. Like many government initiatives, that report is now gathering dust somewhere in Fyshwick in a government warehouse. But while I'm in this place you can consider me to be undertaking my own perpetual Henry tax review—always on the lookout for opportunities to cut tax, to flatten tax, to make the tax system more efficient, to create tax incentives and establish a tax system that rewards effort. I want Australians to keep more of what they earn, to re-invest it, to take risks and realise their full promise. But a business-as-usual approach won't get us there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one can look at the ways our governments operate and say that Australia's federation is performing as intended. I want to see less power invested in Canberra and more power entrusted at the point of delivery for government services. I want to see the Commonwealth draw clear lines around what is our responsibility and what is the responsibility of other jurisdictions. But as we empower localised decision-making the Commonwealth should use its leverage to drive national reforms, to remove inefficient taxes, red tape and increase our national productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see our states and territories compete against each other to be the most attractive places to live, work and do business. I want a race to the bottom on inefficient taxes and a race to the top on economic growth. I'll be working towards this goal because I believe this to be the path to a more prosperous Australia, an Australia where we can afford to provide more for our communities and where our households can provide more for themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homeownership has long been an intrinsic and admirable feature of Australian society. Menzies described homeownership as giving citizens a stake in the country. It has been a national rite of passage, the cornerstone of the Australian family unit, and the opportunity for Australians to grow their wealth and achieve authority over their own future. But it is a dream that has slowly become less attainable for a large number of Australians in recent decades. In 1971, 64 per cent of my age cohort owned their own home. Today that figure stands at only 50 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many factors that have influenced this change, and of course there's no silver bullet, but my experience in the property sector has led me to apportion the cause of this generational erosion in affordability to years of planning-system failures and rising property taxes. These failures have not just affected the private sales market but have been felt across the housing continuum. In my community, we are facing a rental crisis and waiting lists for social housing have never been longer. We need to do better as a nation to house our citizens, and the answer isn't more government. The answer is not new federal government interventions, which pump demand, or new tax arrangements, which restrict investment. The answer is more supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While our states and territories control most of the policy levers which control supply, I believe the Commonwealth has a role to play in bringing the states to the table on a reform agenda which streamlines our planning systems, removes inefficient property taxes and sets national affordability goals. Housing affordability needs to be on the national agenda because it goes to our national character. It goes to the type of society we want to create and the autonomy and financial independence of our citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be a leading voice in this chamber to keep the Australian dream alive, for future generations, by boosting the supply of housing across our country. But this supply needs to be matched by investment in roads and other infrastructure, in our suburban communities, to maintain our quality of life. Major projects in the inner cities have received the lion's share of government expenditure, while our suburban communities have been neglected. For my community, my focus will be to secure more investment in our local infrastructure. The Redlands has experienced massive population growth, but we are suffering without adequate investment in our roads, schools, hospitals and island infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's now less than a decade until my region helps host the 2032 Olympic Games. If governments allow that opportunity to pass my community by without a significant legacy investment in local infrastructure, then it will be to our eternal shame. I intend to be an unapologetic advocate for suburban Australia where the majority of our citizens live, where much of our wealth is created and where the moral heart of our nation resides. The true spirit of modern Australia is not found in our boardrooms or lecture theatres. It certainly isn't found in the twittersphere. It is found around our kitchen tables, on the sidelines of our district sporting fields, in shopping centre cafes and school pick-up zones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will champion the issues that matter to the people in my community like rising energy costs, the impact of inflation on household budgets, the challenges of raising children in the modern world and protecting Australia's heritage and way of life. There are many in this building who hold these suburban values and our national traditions with disdain. They conspire to change our flag, our head of state, our national day and our services of remembrance. But our traditions, our heritage and our way of life aren't relics of the past. They've been core to our nation's success. We need to protect what has served us well and take a natural Australian scepticism to big symbolic gestures that promise so much but deliver so little. Empty symbolism isn't harmless. It distracts the attentions of government, the media and the public away from the real issues that affect vulnerable Australians and delivers a false sense of achievement, which undermines efforts that will get real results.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm an eighth generation Australian but, whether your people have been here for eight generations, 80,000 years or you were sworn in as a citizen eight days ago, I believe that every Australian should be equal. No Australian citizen is anyone's guest in this country. Arguments over our national identity at home threaten to undermine our capacity to respond as a united country to external threats. Over the horizon, we face a challenge like we haven't seen in eight decades. All sides of this chamber need to be awake to the realities of this danger and united in taking the action required to prepare for it. This will be the greatest public policy challenge that my generation of Australians face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been the Australian way ever since the birth of our federation never to kowtow to tyrants and never to leave a friend in need of assistance. Australia must never trade her sovereignty for economic convenience, and, equally, we should never stand by and watch our freedom-loving friends in the Asia-Pacific be swallowed by authoritarianism or be reduced to vassal states by the actions of local elites. Australia must have the capacity to respond to threats as, when and where they emerge. While I sound this warning, I do hold out great hope for the future of our region. I believe it is inevitable that the people of the world currently living under authoritarianism will seek to cast off their yokes. It is not just the West that yearns for liberal and open society. The spirit of freedom is inherent in every human being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A time will come when the light of liberty burns too brightly for central committees to control, and history has taught us that external pressure is key to igniting the embers of internal change. I posit that Australia has a role to play in sparking the flame of liberty in our region. Our abiding national purpose in this century should be to prosper in the face of economic pressure, to defend against expansionist aggression and to stand as a symbol of hope, aspiration and mateship to all the peoples of the Asia-Pacific. While I'm in this place, I intend to do what I believe is right and say what I believe is the truth without fear or favour, safe in the knowledge that we have a higher judge than just our voters. If He is for us, who can be against us?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I have been assisted by many friends and supporters on my journey here, and I want to name just a few of them today, many of whom are in the gallery and have been in the gallery for several hours this afternoon. Bear with me; there are a few of them: Robin and Cynthia Archer; Josh Bull; Chris and Loretta Reeves; Marcel and Paula Doedens; Bob Neich; Greg Jamieson; Ronda Gladwell; Savanna Labuschagne; Fred and Gloria Olsson; Nathan and Laura Althaus; Karl Sharples; Rajiv Saha; John and Gael Howie; Ian and Ella Marshall; Kent and Jo Wilcox; Samuel Chamberlain; Catherine and John Stynes; Alistair Coe; Mathew Graham; Ben Damiano; Sam Jackson-Hope; Tom White; Jimmy Kiploks; Nathan Percy; Ged and Rachel Connors; Rob and Val Simmons; Santo Santoro; Cheryl Boyce; Alan Mason; Andrew McEwan; Peter and Von Hosking; Peter and Linda Grieve—I told you there were a few of them!—Mark and Julie Robinson; Jarrod Noble; Vicki Sloman; Adam and Amanda Stoker; Senator Matt Canavan; Zed Seselja; David Goodwin; Rohit Pathak; Mitchell Dickens; Alan and Janice Lucas; Phil Richards; Councillor Jacob Heremaia; Linda and Robert Bucci; Rob Murray; Gaye White; Barbara Bentham; Adrian Addicott; and Frank Mawson.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, most of all, I want to thank my family, who have done more than anyone to get me here today. To my mother and father, Toni and Jon Pike, whose example of service and sacrifice taught me so much: you set me up for success and have always been there to support me. Thank you for all you have done. My darling wife, Kate, has dealt with the pressures of being a political spouse with wonderful grace. She is the most generous and kind-hearted person I've ever met and I don't know what I ever did to deserve her.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2022. This bill provides an entitlement to 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave in a 12-month period for full-time, part-time and casual employees. The bill builds on the measures put in place by the former coalition government following the independent Fair Work Commission's 2018 decision to grant five days of unpaid family and domestic violence leave to employees covered by a modern award. The Fair Work Commission made its decision after carefully considering extensive evidence and submissions from unions, employers and other interested parties. The Fair Work Commission's proposal at the time meant that the approximately two million Australians on awards would be eligible to receive five days of unpaid family and domestic violence leave. This earlier Fair Work Commission decision would have created a complexity for Australian businesses, particularly small and medium businesses, that had collective or individual agreements as well as award-reliant employees. This complexity would have seen workers who were on an award entitled to five days unpaid family and domestic violence leave, while a worker in the same organisation who was on a collective agreement might have been unable to access such entitlement unless it was provided in their agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising this, in December 2018 the former coalition government passed historic legislation enshrining five days unpaid family and domestic violence leave in the National Employment Standards, which set out 11 minimum employment entitlements to ensure a consistency of entitlements for employees. The former coalition government's reforms matched the decision of the Fair Work Commission for award-reliant employees. This new entitlement ensured, as far as possible, consistency in entitlements for employees in the national system and reduced complexity for businesses. Reducing this complexity was welcomed by, and has been beneficial for, businesses as it reduced the time businesses spend having to ensure the appropriate allocation of leave. Legislating in the National Employment Standards a right to unpaid family and domestic violence leave was an important step and was part of the various measures put in place by the former coalition government to support family and domestic violence victims and to address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a strong and proud record of investing in measures to support women's safety. From 2013 to 2022, the coalition invested over $2 billion in women's safety, including a record $1.1 billion, under the 2021-22 budget, to prevent and respond to violence against women and their children. Our investment in women's safety was a key part of a $3.4 billion package of new measures to improve outcomes for women in the 2021-22 budget, along with investment in economic security, leadership, health and wellbeing. Key measures in the 2021-22 budget included up to $260 million for a two-year national partnership with states and territories to boost local frontline services and trial new initiatives during the transition to the next national plan; $164.8 million over two years to establish escaping violence payments, which provide up to $1,500 in cash and a further $3,500 in kind for goods or direct payment of bonds, school fees or other items; $416.2 million to build on existing support in the family law system, including through family advocacy and support services, children's contact services and increased legal assistance funding; $129 million to ensure that women can access support for a range of legal issues, including much-needed family law and family violence assistance; $101.4 million to enhance existing, and establish new, children's contact services, which provide a safe, reliable and neutral place for supervised contact and facilitated changeovers to minimise conflict between parents and reduce safety risks for families; $85 million to expand the geographic coverage of the Family Advocacy and Support Service, commencing 2022-23, to ensure that the service is accessible to all family law litigants who need it and is responsive to their needs; and $17.1 million to increase access to legal and mental health support services to women across Australia who have experienced, or are experiencing, family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government built on these measures in the 2022-23 budget, announcing measures including $87.9 million over four years to expand the important Lighthouse Project and improve culturally responsive support for First Nations Australians; an additional $52.4 million over four years for the Family Violence and Cross-Examination of Parties Scheme, which protects victims-survivors of family violence from being directly cross-examined by their perpetrators; and $14.8 million over five years to support a nationally coordinated approach to education and training on family, domestic and sexual violence for community frontline workers, health professionals and the family law and criminal justice sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the 2022 Fair Work Commission decision on paid domestic and family violence leave. In its March 2018 family and domestic violence leave decision, the Fair Work Commission decided to vary modern awards to provide employees experiencing family and domestic violence with an entitlement to five days unpaid leave. It also proposed to revisit the question of whether provision should be made for paid family and domestic violence leave in June 2021. In May 2022, the Fair Work Commission handed down its decision recommending 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave for award employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question of what workplace leave should be available to victims of family and domestic violence was considered in extensive detail by the independent Fair Work Commission in its 2021 inquiry. These considerations included whether leave should be paid, how much leave was appropriate, how it should accrue, the rate at which it should be paid and who should have access to leave. The Fair Work Commission reached its decision after consideration of evidence, and the decision was based on the input and advocacy of a range of unions and employer representative bodies. Submissions were made and hearings were conducted for every single step of the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its May 2022 decision, the Fair Work Commission recommended:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. Full time employees and, on a pro-rata basis part-time employees, should be entitled to 10 days paid FDV leave per year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. The entitlement to 10 days paid FDV leave per year should accrue progressively across the year in the same way as for personal/carer's leave accrues under the NES … The entitlement should accumulate from year to year, but subject to a 'cap' whereby the total accrual does not exceed 10 days at any given time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. The FDV leave entitlement should be accessible in advance of an entitlement to such leave accruing, by agreement between an employer and employee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">4. The FDV leave entitlement should operate on the basis that it is paid at the employee's 'base rate of pay' as defined in s.16 of the FW Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">5. The definition of 'family and domestic violence' should be in the same terms as the definition in s.106B(2) of the FW Act (and not extend to FDV perpetrated by a member of the employee's household who is not related to the employee).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6. In all other relevant respects the model FDV leave term should reflect the terms of s.106B.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is 106B of the act, the current unpaid family and domestic violence leave provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with the decision of the former coalition government in relation to unpaid family and domestic violence leave, this entitlement should be enshrined in the National Employment Standards to ensure as far as possible consistency in entitlements for employees in the national system and to reduce complexity for business. The coalition respects the integrity of the fair and balanced process the Fair Work Commission undertook in making its decision, taking into consideration all the evidence before it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House goes beyond the model recommended by the independent Fair Work Commission and implements many of the claims made by the ACTU during the hearing into the matter. There is a need to recognise that many business stakeholders, whilst supporting the Fair Work Commission's decision and the enshrining of that model in the National Employment Standards, have raised concerns in relation to areas of the government's bill that differ from the Fair Work Commission model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's legislation goes further than the model proposed by the Fair Work Commission in its decision in the following ways. Firstly, it provides 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave in a 12-month period for casual employees. Secondly, in relation to the accrual, employees would gain 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave from the commencement date of 1 February 2023 rather than have it accrue like other leave entitlements. Thirdly, it provides for employees to access paid family and domestic violence leave at their full rate of pay for the hours that they would have worked had they not taken the leave. Fourthly, it extends the definition of 'family and domestic violence' to include conduct of a current or former intimate partner of an employee or a member of an employee's household. Fifthly, it extends the full paid entitlement to all employees when the International Labour Organization convention No. 190, concerning violence and harassment, comes into force for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to what the Fair Work Commission found in relation to these particular issues following its extensive research and consultation. The Fair Work Commission considered all the issues proposed in the bill, many of which were put forward by the ACTU. In reaching its decision, the Fair Work Commission was clear that it did not support the breadth of the ACTU proposals and found against a number of them. The full bench stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compared to the ACTU claim, the <span style="font-style:italic;">provisional </span>model term provides better alignment with existing NES entitlements and will have less impact on business in terms of employment costs and the regulatory burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the accrual of leave, the Fair Work Commission said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the entitlement to 10 days' paid FDV leave per year should accrue progressively during a year of service—in the same way as for personal/carer's leave under the NES … The entitlement should accumulate from year to year, but subject to a 'cap' whereby the total accrual available does not exceed 10 days at any given time. This will have the effect of operating as a phasing-in mechanism for the entitlement for the first 12 months after the entitlement takes effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the extension of 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave in a 12-month period for casual employees, the Fair Work Commission did not recommend this as the National Employment Standards do not recommend paid leave to casuals. The Fair Work Commission also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the FW Act provides no precedent, nor a model for a workable scheme, for the provision of paid leave to casual employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant operational difficulties in extending paid family and domestic violence leave to casuals, as noted by the Fair Work Commission and acknowledged by the ACTU during the hearings, with the ACTU saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACTU accepts that there are some operational challenges associated with extending paid FDV leave to casuals, including in relation to those casual employees whose hours of work are genuinely uncertain …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Fair Work Commission said in relation to casuals is extremely important to note. This is because the government is fundamentally changing the way the Fair Work Act deals with paid leave and casual employees. As the Fair Work Commission said, the Fair Work Act provides no precedent nor a model for a workable scheme for the provision of paid leave of any type to casual employees. Casual employees are often paid a casual loading to compensate them for the lack of entitlements they receive such as paid holiday and sick leave. Casual loading is extra money paid to casual workers over and above the normal hourly rate that full-timers or part-timers get paid in the same job. Even the ACTU acknowledged that there are significant operational difficulties in extending paid family and domestic violence leave to casuals, as noted by the Fair Work Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the rate of pay, the Fair Work Commission recommended the calculation of the payment should be based upon the employee's base rate of pay, not their full rate of pay, in the same fashion that the National Employment Standards pay leave entitlement operates. The Fair Work Commission also contended that it would be overly disruptive to the integrity of the safety net if it were to depart from the way all other paid leave entitlements operate, which the National Employment Standards provide. The Fair Work Commission also noted that the Fair Work Act applies this rationale even to needs based leave entitlement such as personal or carer's leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Business and employer stakeholders in the main limited their support to the terms set out in the Fair Work Commission's model for paid domestic violence leave. They agreed to the enshrining of the 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave in the National Employment Standards, to ensure a consistency of entitlements for employees. They have, however, raised significant concerns with the government's departure from the Fair Work Commission's proposed model, which, I've indicated, goes much further than the model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the positions as advocated by the major employer groups. Ai Group states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed legislation departs from the carefully considered approach proposed by the Commission in various ways that undermine its workability and reasonableness. It instead adopts elements similar to the ACTU proposal that the Commission had rejected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill should be amended to reflect the sensible and considered views of the Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike the approach adopted in the proposed legislation, the Commission envisaged that the new 10-day entitlement should apply to permanent employees rather than casuals; be calculated on a pro-rata basis for part-time workers; and should accrue progressively during an employee's first year of employment unless an employer agreed to grant it in advance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission also proposed that employees should be paid their base rate of pay when accessing the leave. This is the approach taken when an employee accesses personal/carer's leave. The Bill would instead require employers to pay employees amounts including penalty rates, overtime rates and various allowances when they access the leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will be much more costly for employers than the approach proposed by the Commission and there are significant questions about how the rate of pay that must be provided to an employee could even be calculated in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry supports the inclusion of paid family and domestic violence leave in the National Employment Standards, it raised similar concerns to Ai Group. As a party to the commission's 2021 review, ACCI advocated for family and domestic violence leave to accrue progressively but not accumulate from year to year. ACCI submitted that providing paid leave upfront will have practical consequences, particularly for small and medium businesses with limited cashflow and cash reserves. The Fair Work Commission itself, at paragraph 842 of the decision, agreed:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are persuaded by the submissions of ACCI and Ai Group that the paid FDV leave entitlement should not accrue 'upfront' in the way proposed by the ACTU because of the potential cost consequences this will produce upon the commencement of the entitlement and in respect of new employees. In particular, we accept, as ACCI contends, that the provision of paid FDV leave 'upfront' will adversely affect small and medium-sized businesses with limited cashflow or cash reserves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACCI also opposed the ACTU's claim for family and domestic violence leave to be paid at an employee's ordinary rate of pay, noting that annual and personal carer's leave are calculated at an employee's base rate of pay. Again I note that the Fair Work Commission agreed with these concerns, stating at paragraph 860 of the decision:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, we consider that it would be overly disruptive to the integrity of the safety net to establish, on an across-the-board basis, a new paid leave entitlement which operates on a radically different basis to the paid leave entitlements for which the NES currently provides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, ACCI raised concerns regarding the extension of paid family and domestic violence leave to casual employees. This is a position that the independent Fair Work Commission agreed with in its decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia in its submission urged the government to consider the needs of all micro and small businesses as it introduces the 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave into the National Employment Standards. They asked the government to recognise that the circumstances of family and domestic violence and the varied nature of small businesses make regulation in this area complex. Many small businesses do not possess the requisite knowledge, resources and expertise to provide support to their workers at the very time when they are reaching out for help. We need to be mindful of how small business owners will work through the compliance required in these situations and how they will be provided with appropriate information and support. COSBOA says that this support should be accompanied by funding to support trusted advisers and trusted organisations, the pathways small business owners already turn to for help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COSBOA also has concerns that sole traders and microbusiness owners have not been considered, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are over 700,000 sole proprietors in Australia. If they themselves are a victim of domestic violence, under the current bill before parliament they have been forgotten. We need to fix that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a crucial consideration for government; how do we support women who are sole traders or managing a small business?  How do they access support, particularly in sensitive situations where an abuser may have control or access to the business?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the Senate committee inquiry and note that a number of very sensible observations were made by coalition senators on the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee in the report tabled on 1 September 2022. Coalition senators noted that the proposed government legislation has gone beyond the provisional model of the Fair Work Commission decision and raised in particular how the additional requirements will affect businesses, particularly small and family businesses. At paragraphs 1.27 and 1.28 of their additional comments coalition senators noted the complexity of introducing paid family and domestic violence leave for businesses, particularly the small and medium business sector, and they advised:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the Government's legislation departs significantly from the decision of the FWC in relation to FDVL, the Government needs to urgently clarify how the additional requirements will affect businesses, particularly small and family business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At paragraph 1.25 of their additional comments coalition senators noted that the proposed legislation is also silent on the reporting obligations of employers:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this ambiguity only creates further uncertainty and guess work for small business operators, who are already experiencing a challenging economic and labour shortage environment. In this regard, sole traders and small business owners may be in a family-owned small business or partnership, where one partner is the FDV perpetrator, and the other is the victim. According to COSBOA … 35 per cent of business owners were female and accessing paid FDVL will not assist them if sole-trader or micro businessperson is the primary income maker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition senators also noted at paragraph 1.26 of their additional comments concern around the ambiguity of the new provision with respect to perpetrators of family and domestic violence accessing the new entitlement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">During the committee hearings, department officials indicated that the provision for the entitlement was for those 'experiencing' FDV, nevertheless, deliberately vague, or not, the government must clarify its intent within the actual legislation regarding perpetrators of FDV.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition senators in their additional comments made the following recommendations:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the Government provide greater details about the impact of the FDVL model on small and family businesses, particularly regarding casual workers, and provide additional assistance to ensure these businesses are not adversely affected by the administration of the scheme or worse off financially;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by observing that the coalition notes the rationale provided by the Fair Work Commission in handing down its model for 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave. The coalition acknowledges the concerns raised by business and employers in relation to the provisions of the bill that go beyond the Fair Work Commission's recommended model. Notwithstanding the research and consultation carried out by the Fair Work Commission, the government has opted to legislate a scheme for paid family and domestic violence leave which is far broader and, potentially, more costly than the Fair Work Commission and industry previously contemplated. These issues must be worked through with employers and in particular, small-business employers prior to the commencement of the operation of this entitlement. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I am pleased to rise today to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2022 and am incredibly pleased to be supporting this bill. This bill will deliver on our election commitment to provide employees with access to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave per 12-month period under the Fair Work Act. If the bill does proceed, this will start from 1 February 2023 and provide this to so many people that may need it. There is a provision to allow for a longer period of time for small business to put their processes in place, but from 1 August 2023 all employees—regardless of whether they are employed in a small, medium or large business, regardless of whether they are employed on a full-time, part-time or casual basis—will be able to access paid family and domestic violence leave. This will mean more than 11 million Australians will be eligible for this entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am at pains to say that I hope not that many people will have to take up this leave. This is for extraordinary circumstances where someone will need to take paid family and domestic violence leave to help them, whether it is to escape, relocate, obtain counselling—a range of issues that come as a result of family and domestic violence. This is an important entitlement, and while we hope that the take-up of this is low it is important that Australians can access it. Whether they need to escape or deal with violent home lives, family and domestic violence, this is an important safety net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new leave entitlement applies to casuals, but there will only be a paid entitlement for shifts that they are rostered. All casuals will have upfront access to up to 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave in a 12-month period when the new entitlement comes into effect. It was disappointing to hear those on the opposite side talk about this as if it was a problem, because, as I said, these are not usual circumstances. These should be extraordinary circumstances in which we are providing support for those most vulnerable. Payment will be at an employee's full rate of pay, worked out as if the employee had worked the hours in a period in which the employee was rostered. This means that casuals, when they take leave for the period they were rostered for, will have a national employment standard of leave entitlement and will receive payment for the shift they would have worked at the rate that would have been paid, including applicable loadings. This is to make sure that casual workers are included in this scheme, because domestic and family violence doesn't discriminate in who it affects. Whether they are casual workers, part-time workers or full-time workers, women escaping family and domestic violence should not find themselves having to choose between paid employment and escaping domestic and family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the results of the 2016 ABS Personal Safety Survey, women are more likely to take time off work after experiencing violence by their current or previous partner. The various impacts on victims-survivors arising from family and domestic violence mean that victims-survivors may quickly exhaust their leave entitlements, such as annual leave and personal leave. This is especially pronounced for casual employees, who may already experience insecure work and typically don't have other leave entitlements to draw upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides universal access to paid leave, greater accessibility and, importantly, more financial security. The community has been calling for this important entitlement for years. The Business Council of Australia support this work, as do women's legal services and other family and domestic violence support services. Of course, the Australian Council of Trade Unions have been campaigning for this for over a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not too long ago, it was commonplace to accept community assumptions that domestic violence was something that should be dealt with in the privacy of people's homes—that it was an issue to be kept in the shadows and not spoken about openly. But we know this isn't true. We now need to look past the home and into the workplace. Workplaces play an important role in not only supporting and protecting people experiencing violence—mostly women—but also enabling them to leave violent relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget the moment when the intersection between workplaces and domestic violence hit home for me. It was 11.15 am on Wednesday 17 November 2004 when 61-year-old Carole Schaer was shot dead as she worked in the handbag and shoe section of the Myer department store in Adelaide's Rundle Mall. I was then an organiser for the SDA and was acutely involved in the response to that horrific incident. I vividly remember Carole's funeral and the impact not just on her family but on her friends, her colleagues and her employers as well. Carole's tragic death brought home to me that we cannot separate the workplace and the home. Domestic violence and family violence ripple throughout our community and ripple across our society, including in our workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workplaces, employers and unions have a very important role in ending the unacceptable rates of violence against mostly women and children. Approximately 68 per cent of victims-survivors experiencing family and domestic violence are in paid work, and maintaining employment, financial independence and social connections can be key factors in ensuring that they have the courage to leave a violent situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, one in six women and one in 16 men have experienced gendered violence by a current or former partner since the age of 15. On average, one woman dies every 10 days in Australia at the hands of their former or current partner. This is absolutely unacceptable. They're not just statistics; they're employees, they're colleagues, they're bosses and they're mentors. These experiences of violence can result in victims-survivors requiring time away from work for a variety of reasons, such as injury, seeking safe accommodation, attending police or court services, attending counselling or medical appointments or caring for children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not circumstances that are ordinary. They're not circumstances that can be dealt with in the normal way that workplaces deal with things like carer's leave or sick leave. These are extraordinary circumstances, and we need to treat them that way. No-one should have to choose between a job and managing the impact of an abusive relationship. This entitlement will provide important additional practical support within a broader suite of options available to help victims-survivors heal as well as to promote their economic security.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister for Social Services, I am responsible for the government's broader response to domestic and family violence. I have worked very quickly in our time in government to work towards ensuring that the escaping violence payment is fit for purpose and that 1800RESPECT and other important measures, including keeping women safe in their homes and the DV-alert training for workplace employers, are meeting the need. This entitlement will join a suite of valuable tools to fight to end violence against women and children. It further clearly demonstrates that our government stands with victim-survivors who experience family and domestic violence and is providing Australia with the national leadership that is needed to end family, domestic and sexual violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also amends the definition of family and domestic violence in the Fair Work Act to cover family and domestic violence perpetrated by a member of an employee's household. The new definition covers violent, threatening or other abusive behaviour by a member of an employee's household or close relative, including sexual violence. Close relatives includes immediate family members and relationships according to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kinship rules. An extension of this definition of family and domestic violence includes conduct of a member of an employee's household, to recognise that Australians are living in more diverse and different arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also aligns with the objectives of the Draft National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. It has been a priority of mine to finalise this plan and to make sure that there is a response to this horrific incidence of this violence in Australia and that it does support the response and recovery of the healing process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to making sure that we are investing in women's safety as well as delivering on our election commitment to generate 500 new frontline and community workers to support women and children experiencing domestic violence; $100 million for crisis and transitional housing to assist women fleeing violence; and, of course, establishing the new Family, Domestic and SexualViolence Commission to act as an advocate for victim-survivors. The benefits of offering paid family and domestic violence leave far outweigh the associated cost to business and community, and there are many businesses that already recognise this and offer paid family and domestic violence leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that is working to end violence against women and children. However, all parts of Australian society, including the government, community and workplaces, all have a role to play in addressing this. Let's work together to aim to ensure that the next generation of men and women don't have to deal with the tragedies we are seeing now.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022 is part and parcel of an amendment of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation 1988. Basically, what it's about is that in the past we had a step down that, after 45 weeks, what you were paid in your education process of getting back onto civvy street was reduced to 75 per cent. This is pertinent to around 600 veterans that we currently have. We currently have in Australia about 343,000 people who have done service and are back on civvy street. This is part and parcel of what the coalition was bringing forward. It was in our budget. We allocated $7.1 million to it in the budget, and it is good to see that there is now consensus and the government has brought it forward. It's a shame that the government didn't sit earlier and we could have had these payments start earlier. I acknowledge that people will get back pay. The parliament is going to sit seven weeks, which is patently absurd, but it's good that this has come forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredibly important that someone who has served our nation manages to get back into society in a cogent way and a way that fulfils their requirements of a long life after they have left the service. I reflect also in the rehabilitation section on the service of the member for Herbert, who I'm sure will have a lot more to say about this in a more formidable way than I can espouse. I also acknowledge the other servicemen. The member for Braddon is here. No doubt he will have something to say about it as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My own father was repatriated after his time in the services. He was smashed up. He always reminded me about this. An anti-aircraft gun was dropped on him by the American troops when they were loading as part of the process of embarkation to the Italian peninsula, which he never got to, thank God. That's why I think I'm here. He was a lance bombardier at that stage. After warning people—'If you stand underneath that crane and something breaks, someone is going to get badly hurt'—something broke, and the person who was badly hurt and put into a wheelchair for a period of time was my father.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His path back into society was to study very hard. He got accepted into Sydney university, where he did vet science. That's pretty good for a person who left school when they were 14. He reminded me that he had to teach himself chemistry and physics. As he started teaching himself chemistry and they started talking about ions he actually thought they meant irons for ironing clothes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He and others at that time were at a place called Neringah Hostel at Wahroonga. The process for those ex-servicemen, whether they had been in the Air Force or the Army, was to go to university. That's where they stayed. They were being repatriated. They went back to university. There were not just the physical issues—the hurt. He reminded me of the ex-fighter pilots who had been under incredible stress in their service and who had been mentally affected as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is noncontroversial. We look forward to assisting the government to get this through as quickly as possible. I've had discussions with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel. I appreciate and commend him for reaching out. We will make sure that we work together so that we look after people who have served our nation. There are circumstances before our nation right now that mean that, unfortunately, once more we have to build up our services, by reason of the quite obvious threat we are all aware of and we can see on the television most nights. To do that we have to show people not only that we look after them in the services but, very importantly, that we look after them after their service and we bring them back into society in a way that allows them to be in sight of those who have not served.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are those who have paid the supreme sacrifice and those who have been psychologically tormented by it. There are other issues pertinent to that as well—by reason of them being away, families have broken up. There is immense stress that goes onto the partners when someone is away. Naturally enough, as people are away for long periods of time, people's lives can in some instances go in different directions. This causes immense fervour to people on both sides of that marriage or partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that is very pertinent of course is that when people go away other people get on with their lives and become successful in business or become successful in their career. There is a sense of umbrage when people come back and say, 'I served my nation and you became very wealthy.' This is not really fair, because, by serving their nation, they gave that person the right and the protection to take the career path that they took. One of the ways to keep this within sight is to make sure that people have the capacity to be educated. This bill, with the amendment pertinent to the two sections of the acts which I mentioned—the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998—will also mean that it stays within the international covenant on economic and social issues, I think it is, which also speaks about this issue. It will make sure that we are complying with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I won't delay the House. I think the people who are waiting for this payment have been delayed long enough. I thank everybody for their attention.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  It is pleasing to see that this Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022 does have bipartisan—in fact tripartisan, as it may be—support. We all support our veterans. I too would like to acknowledge the service of members of this place and, indeed, the other place; I see the member for Braddon is here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all owe our veterans a debt of gratitude and of course we value their ongoing commitment. Too many of them continue to come home damaged—emotionally, mentally—after their service and it's up to us in civvy street to do all that we can to make sure that they transition back into having very productive and, indeed, happy lives. These are people who have sacrificed everything that they have. They're willing to put their lives on the line for their country; the least we can do is make sure that we are there for them when they come home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a pretty simple bill. As the former Deputy Prime Minister said, the coalition had this in their budget. And I can't let his sledge go unremarked upon—and it's a shame, because this has consensus support. He can't have a go at us for bringing this on within the first few months of our government. We're just over 100 days into government and they were on the benches for nine years—nine years! They could have extended this pilot when they were in government but they didn't. I'm sure it wasn't because of malice or anything else, it was just sheer incompetence. They didn't get through the workload that they set for themselves; they just didn't do it! So it's no good having a go at us when we're onto this in the first few months of our term in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is sitting here showing his commitment to this process, and this will extend the payments to make sure that people are not unduly affected by them being cut. It's vital that this legislation is progressed to support the 370 veterans who are currently experiencing a payment reduction due to the inaction of those opposite. It helps them transition, as I said, and we are committed—we are absolutely committed—as a government to delivering a comprehensive employment program for veterans, to support personnel as they make that transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the former government introduced this as a pilot program to support veterans. It was a good pilot; unfortunately, pilots come to an end. The former government had the chance to extend it and they didn't get around to doing it, and that left too many people unnecessarily affected. The government—as, I'm sure, the entire parliament—cares about the 370 people affected by this. We couldn't simply let it end; that would have meant an immediate reduction of up to 25 per cent if it weren't fixed. We can't leave these people hanging.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation 2004 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 to provide for all eligible veterans covered under these two schemes. It will enable veterans undertaking an eligible course of study to access the beneficial arrangements for an additional year, to 30 June 2023, where the calculation of incapacity payments is based on 100 per cent of the veteran's pre-injury earnings. That's important: it ensures that student veterans who should have been eligible for the higher rate of payment can receive back payments to cover the period from 1 July 2022. So these payments are compensation for lost earnings incurred as a direct result of a physical or mental injury sustained while serving and incurred as a result of protecting Australians. As I said, far too many veterans come home hurt and damaged, and we all deal with them as constituents in our electorate. I was in this place when the member for Braddon made some of his fine speeches and contributions on this matter. In the last parliament, we spoke about the ultimate sacrifice Teddy Sheean made, and the member for Braddon made a very fine speech on that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We owe these people everything. I can't express this in words. I've not served in uniform, except for a very brief stint as a 14-year-old in Army Cadets—not the most successful career in the services! We owe them everything. They are willing to put everything on the line. Far too many of them come home damaged. We need to do everything we possibly can to ensure that they have a happy and productive life once they're back home in Australia, and this bill will help that journey.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022. I'll start by acknowledging my colleague the member for Braddon for his service to our nation and by acknowledging the other members of this chamber who are veterans. It was a particular privilege and pleasure to listen to the first speech of the member for Menzies earlier in the evening. It reminded us how lucky and honoured those of us who haven't served in uniform are to have their experience in this chamber and, more broadly, in this building when we're making these decisions. I think it's vitally important that we have their firsthand experience, and their contributions in these debates make these decisions all the stronger for them. So thank you very much for your service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As previous speakers have pointed out, this was a pilot program that had been in place for around four years and that came to an end on 30 June. It was never the former government's intention for that to happen, but, of course, the political election timetable meant that the extension this bill provides couldn't be enacted until now. It's a little bit disappointing that we're only getting to this in September, but I accept the challenge and appreciate that this will compensate those affected by the bill not being in place in time for it to be an ongoing extension. No-one affected will ultimately be out of pocket. It's regrettable that that's come to pass, but we're in a position to rectify that, and I'm confident of the swift passage of this bill through this House and the Senate so that we can get on with this important measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of parliament, I deal, as we all do, with our veterans' communities. They're the most inspiring people in local community. All of them served our country, and some of them have come back from their service with various challenges but an enormous capacity to contribute, after finishing their service in uniform, in other ways in their community. Sometimes it's important to make sure we're supporting them through education pathways et cetera so that they can go on to have whatever career they want after the career that has been such an immense service to our nation. This bill, of course, ensures that they are not adversely financially affected by the short lapse in the incapacity payments they receive whilst they undertake the study needed for the next opportunity in their career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're no different to any other country: we haven't always had the best understanding of how to support the people that have served our nation when they return from that service. I think that has been the case for the entire history of this nation since Federation and before. It's the case in most nations—we haven't always properly understood the full impact of service in the armed forces, particularly from a mental health point of view. We're lucky to live in an era now where there's a much greater understanding of mental health challenges and, more importantly, acceptance and support for dealing with those challenges. That has regrettably meant that, in the decades and the generations gone by, although not out of intention, we certainly haven't done what we should have done for those who have served our nation and not received the support they should have in the period beyond their service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really a good example of the opportunities we have in this chamber to keep doing better by our veterans, who have served this nation. We should be looking always for opportunities to better understand and support them so that the service they've given to this nation is properly respected and valued. This is clearly one of those opportunities. It would be regrettable if a program that had been successful for the past four years were not extended. I don't know what the new government's plans are beyond this financial year's extension, but I'm very pleased to be standing here now to support this bill. I know that it's got the support of the entire chamber. It's a great example of us finding another way to support those who have done so much to serve our country. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  I rise tonight to wholeheartedly support a bill that makes sure we support veterans who are studying to make a better life for themselves, for their families and, in turn, for our communities. I'm on the record in this place as speaking time and time again about the support we must provide veterans and, in particular, about the lack of support veterans have felt over the past 10 years. I'm not going to labour the point, but the actions of the previous government and the sheer lack of appropriate support for veterans really did bring shame on the previous parliaments in our nation. Fortunately, though, a lot of that has changed with the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We are seeing a breath of fresh air in the way veterans are treated and the respect they're given. We are taking a hard and serious look at what needs to be done, and we all know there is a lot that needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022, and in others soon to be debated there are real changes for veterans and their families. We on this side of the House know that it is a solemn duty of government to support our veterans. In this bill we are supporting veterans and their families as they leave the Defence Force, enabling them to continue their commitment to service in civilian life in different ways. It's not an easy transition for anyone, but for those who are injured there are additional challenges, and that means support is critical, necessary and, generally, urgent. Here we are extending a four-year pilot program which has supported eligible veterans into full-time study. It's disappointing that the former government failed to introduce this legislation before the dissolution of the last parliament, resulting in inconvenience and uncertainty for 370 Australian veterans. Sadly, it was what we learnt to face over many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard it firsthand. Veterans have told me of the pain of waiting for a thousand days just to get their claim heard—not sorted, not done, just heard—and it really troubled me that they were in that situation. I've got to say that Darren Chester, the member for Gippsland, was very good to speak to and deal with. He's no Matt Keogh, by any stretch of the imagination—</span>

                    </a>  But I will say that, working together, we were able to get some outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one example that really strikes me, and it pains me very much to think about how close this came to happening. I was doing an Anzac Day service with a young fellow named Jeb Summers, who runs an organisation called Save Our Services. It's about dealing with people with PTSD and dealing with injury. Jeb won't mind me saying that he's a Middle East veteran. He came up to me and said: 'I'm so disappointed. I'm going to hand my medals back.' People who know me know that I hold Anzac Day and Remembrance Day to be the most important days on our calendar, so to have that happen really got to me. I did not want to take his hard-earned medals back. I begged him not to do it, and he didn't, but I had to make the commitment that I would continue to fight, with him and for him and for everyone else, as hard as I could for as long as I had the honour and privilege of standing here. And that's what I'll continue to do. I continue to work with and support veterans through associations of the likes of MC Labour, a labour-hire company that's running programs for veterans in Victoria to help get them into construction. A lot of veterans have had experience with running machinery in theatres of war and in disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we know that, whenever there's a disaster—we felt that in Black Saturday in 2009—there is a level of angst amongst communities that have lost everything. We were meeting with people who'd had the same clothes on their backs for four days because they couldn't get in and couldn't get out because of the disaster that was unfolding. But no sooner had the Army arrived with the then CDF, Angus Houston, coming in, you could see the level of angst physically drop. People took a sigh of relief. 'You're here to help.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the way we respect our serving ADF personnel. We respect the work that they do and what they bring with them. When they have finished their time in the service, the difficulty is then how they transition into life, and it's not that easy. I heard one of the previous members talk about their short time in cadets. I did six years in cadets and I swore I would never, ever join the ADF, because I was sick of polishing boots, getting Brasso out and using that starch to make sure my shirts were all clean and tidy, but it did give me some very valuable things that I carry with me today, including the key to our ADF: integrity, how you value that and how you hold that so dear and so close to your heart. That's why it's important that we make sure that, when veterans leave the ADF, we do look after them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Physical injuries we see. Mental injuries and mental scars we can't. Some physical injuries can be repaired, but mental scars often never can. I know you, Deputy Speaker Buchholz, and many members in this place on all sides will meet with veterans who do have mental scars that don't go away. I know that we all stand together to support them and help them. It's so important that we do that, because we ask them to do something most people wouldn't want to do. I think there have been many occasions where we hear about theatres of war that happen because, as the saying goes, it's old men that make decisions about young men's lives—young men and women these days, more and more. So it's important that we do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I do praise the minister for bringing in and doing this. It's just one of those steps in the pathway to addressing what we know is a problem and putting it together. That's something that I see in Victoria, as I said, with MC Labour and with Rob Curry and the likes out there getting veterans back into employment. It's work that is being supported by the Victorian government through the minister, Shaun Leane. What scares me is that a change of government means an end of this program. That's something I don't want to see, because I think we need to ensure that we continue to do this and support the men and women who we put our faith and trust in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extra financial support is vital for eligible veterans as they transition to a rehabilitation program focused on gaining sustainable employment in the civilian workforce. I think that's the key. It's not about tokenism; it's about getting people something for them to do in the future. There is a wide variety of things that our ex-ADF personnel do. Most contribute a lot to society. Some end up in here; that's a different story!</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Doing this sort of thing is not about bolstering our workforce. It's supporting our veterans, and it means that we've got people getting more and more opportunity to fit into society and to do more. We know even from the Jobs and Skills Summit last week that we need more trained up and ready to work, and it's initiatives like this that will support getting people into work. We all know as well that programs like this not only support veterans financially but result in the most important bit: positive mental health impacts. These things are so important. They should be sacrosanct to make sure that we do that. We ensure that our veterans can continue their education as they transition from service, ultimately increasing their capacity and opportunity for success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we are acting on this where the previous government sadly didn't. I think if we continue to work together on these things, we're going to see far greater outcomes. And I do appreciate the opposition's support for this bill. I don't think there would be anyone in this place who doesn't support our veterans and I don't think there's anyone in this place who can't see the results of the actions that previous governments have taken for our veterans. I'm not just having a crack at those opposite. I'm talking over years and years, from our Vietnam vets all the way through. But we have an opportunity to fix this with all of us working together, and I think that's what's going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the minister bringing more life-changing legislation into this place, supporting our veterans and supporting our families. I commend this bill to the House, and, again, I say thank you to the opposition for supporting us in this way.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Buchholz. I rise in support of this bill, which continues the important initiative that we started in the coalition in support of veterans. As has already been outlined, this bill ensures eligible veterans, who are undertaking approved full-time study as part of their return-to-work rehabilitation program, continue to receive 100 per cent of their pre-injury earnings instead of that payment dropping to 75 per cent after 45 weeks of study. There is nothing more important when transitioning out of the military than meaningful engagement or meaningful employment. This bill makes sure both those things can be easily achieved for those who unfortunately find themselves in a position where they have to leave the ADF because of injury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I took some time to reflect on my journey, which is similar to a lot of my friends. I found myself in the Middle East in Afghanistan in 2009, as a 21-year-old, blown up by an IED that was detonated within one metre of me. I went into this really turbulent time. I felt like I'd failed my friends. I felt like a coward. I felt the moral injury of all my tribe still being overseas, whilst I was at home. I had injuries that were non-visible. You can't see a lot of my injuries, but I have a traumatic brain injury, I'm deaf in my right ear and I was subsequently diagnosed with a mental illness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember sitting at home and being told I didn't have to go to work and parade anymore in the battalion, which in hindsight was probably the worst thing that could have happened to me because my accountability, my desire to get up to do something that I loved, my meaning, my engagement and my employment wasn't there. So at 21, I got these injuries, I was upset that I wasn't overseas with my tribe and angry that I was injured. I didn't have friends to lean on and to talk to. My best friend, who was my best friend at the time and now my wife, gave me a kick in the backside, but I felt like she didn't understand what I was going through because she hadn't served. Then I had my hierarchy saying, 'You must go to an appointment,' but I just didn't go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was at a time when our Defence Force didn't have complex injuries, didn't have people coming back unwell and didn't really know what to do. So I lost my meaning, and this spiral went on for a long time. It went on for years and years. But at the start, they would throw ideas at me, saying things like, 'Do you want to be a security guard when you leave?' 'I don't want to be a security guard.' 'Do you want to go back to concreting?' 'No, I don't want to go back to concreting.' I got into the Defence Force because I wanted to have a purpose, something to get up for, to love and do. I had to put myself through night school to get into the Defence Force, so I didn't have an education anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat there in this big bowl of self-pity until my wife, or girlfriend at that time, and some of my friends when they started to get back gave me a big kick in the backside and said, 'Is this who you want to be? Do you want to be the person who just blames yourself and everyone else?' But I wasn't blaming people; I was just blaming how I was feeling and what I was going through, saying, 'I can't hear in my right ear. I have a brain injury and a mental illness.' I had a mental illness, and I was like: 'I don't want to do that. I want to be better. And I want to do something.' Looking back now, I could have easily been a statistic; I easily could have been on a wall somewhere. As someone who had had suicidal ideation, I could have gone down that path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education: I, who'd gone from a troubled kid to a ratbag barracks soldier to someone that causes trouble, found some solace in education. This bill wasn't around then, but education kind of opened my mind to what else could be there. So I decided: 'You know what? I'm going to do a degree in psychology.' Well, that didn't last very long! I was way out of my depth. Then I said, 'I want to do a bachelor's in something else,' and that didn't last long. And then a diploma fell over. Then I did a Certificate IV in Training Assessment, and I was like: 'You know what? I can do this now.' That cert IV then turned into a diploma, and after that diploma then I got another one. I found that education gave me meaning—a reason to get up in the morning. It gave meaning to a life that had a black hole in it. It gave me something that I wanted to get up and do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the big scheme of things, our veterans go through a very complex journey through their military career. Not all veterans are broken, but even veterans who are can still punch through and find some meaning in their life. Nor should anyone think that veterans who have served or who are transitioning, wounded, injured or ill from their service are all going to study; let's not think that. But let's think that all veterans, and everyone, should have meaningful engagement and/or meaningful employment—something to get up in the morning for, something to love, something that you want to do, something that gives you that drive—because the absence of that creates negative wellbeing in our society. And, to be very frank, it means I'm probably going to attend another funeral. So everyone needs to have some meaning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For that, I believe, education is fantastic. There are many groups that promote the educational side. The soldier now is different from when I was there. But the 'must' is the meaning; the must is the something to love—otherwise, it really can end in tragedy, as we've heard through the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. One veteran told the royal commission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My honest opinion is there needs to be some form of tertiary education or proper employment program so soldiers within combat corps have a chance to find meaningful employment and not just become labor hire for the rest of their lives …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meaningful employment and genuine gratitude for veterans is i believe the key to solving the veteran suicide issue in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you take that, that's the purest comment that you can get, from a veteran who just looks at the world and goes, 'Tertiary qualifications.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I often get labelled a little bit of an officer-hater, because, around the country, there are different pathways for senior officers to a degree—by RPL, or getting gifted something. It becomes an easier pathway into university. As a private soldier, there was definitely not that option for me. I tried to join the APS. They told me I'd be an APS2. So it would've been much less than what I was getting when I was serving, but the experience was much greater. There has always been this view that when you hit a certain officer level, you can RPL a degree, or get a degree, or find it easier to find employment, whereas the soldiers find it harder. And the majority of our wounded, injured and ill are our lower ranks or our lowest ranks—my rank. So it's being able to get an education, whether it's at a tertiary level or whether you go through a pathway, like I did, and get a cert IV. It's not being gifted it but doing it, because that's how you grow. Getting gifted something is not how you grow. I think that's a really positive step in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge you, with the Returned from Active Service Badge, over in the corner, and I appreciate your service. I appreciate the minister being in here. I think it's fantastic. And the former shadow minister for veterans' affairs is here as well. That's because this isn't about politics. This is the furthest thing from politics. It is a time when we debate and disagree. As Shane is moving around, I note there might be some politics in his speech. But the key to this is putting the veterans first and also their families, which are the backbone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Allowing a veteran to receive 100 per cent of their pre-injury wage is the most positive step that we can take in getting people into a tertiary education, giving them an incentive to learn and to grow. It's not an incentive to do nothing. It's an incentive to explore a different world, to find something that they'll be able to do when they leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got people like Curtis McGrath. He found love and meaning in sport. He has gone to the Paralympics. He has won gold medals multiple times. He lost both of his legs. This is a guy who's had all the bad things happen and he's found love, want and meaning in sport. Paul Warren lost his leg. He was an Australian champion Muay Thai boxer, so his profession was his legs. He went into Defence. He quickly went over to Afghanistan in 2009. On 18 July, Ben Ranaudo was killed and Paul lost his leg and transitioned out into this big unknown. He worked for defence industry. He found a want, love and meaning, and now he's going to be taking on study. These are fantastic things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But not all veterans get blown up by IEDs, not all veterans see frontline combat, not all veterans have the same injuries, and we are all not broken. I think something that's extremely important is this whole 'broken veteran' narrative. This whole thing of feeling sorry for our veterans needs to stop. We empower our most bravest, and they have done us proud overseas and on the battlefield, as well as at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville, there are more than 30,000 ADF members, veterans and their families. It's the largest garrison city in the nation. We have plenty of veterans that are doing awesome stuff. We have veterans who are running businesses. One of those really good businesses is Australian Expedition Vehicles. It's run by Michael McMillan. He was also the winner of the most Outstanding Veterans' Employer of the Year in last year's Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Awards. Mick is a veteran himself and doesn't just employ veterans because they are good workers. He doesn't just employ them because they know how to operate military equipment or vehicles. He employs them because of their heart, their want, and his passion for supporting our ADF men and women. He knows the value of a veteran and the mutual benefits that come with being a veteran. Almost all of his employees, veterans, and their work family are just that—a family, a tribe. When I started, I told you that I felt that I'd lost my tribe. These businesses, these awesome companies that are employing veterans, are creating the tribe again. It's like all these ex-service organisations. They all come together because they want to create the tribe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We just need to go that extra step, and I believe this does that. It offers the tribe the ability and the opportunity for education. The hole that is left when you leave the military, especially if you're medically discharged, is one that never gets filled. It is an itch that can never be scratched. I miss being in defence. I miss my mates. I miss going overseas. I don't miss the field. I don't miss the food! I miss the good times. But stories like Michael McMillan's show us that we can actually find hope. We can find hope in our defence tribe and in businesses that want to support people in their next stage of life, because as the door closes on your military service another one opens. Being given that opportunity to get into employment is extremely important for the wellbeing of our brave men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And a lot of these jobs require an education, particularly in areas like mine, where none of my mates that I served with had degrees. This changes that. This provides that encouragement and that purpose to study, and I think that this bill is overdue. I think that this bill brings us, as a parliament, closer together and it brings our Defence Force into a new realm. The Joint Transition Authority is going to help people transition better. We know that it's a whole, but a part of that process is meaningful engagement and meaningful employment, and the way to get there is by having a bill that encourages people and supports people in that education journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While they have families and while they have people there, this is so that support isn't dropped. That's why I am a big supporter of this bill and I commend it to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  Recently, I caught up with Sam Kavanagh and his partner, Annette, who run Bootstraps, a wonderful veterans' organisation based in Gatton in the Lockyer Valley. I caught up with them in Gatton but I also caught up with them before that in Ipswich, at the Cooneana Heritage Centre. Sam was in the military since 1994 and he set up a wonderful charity to help people who are veterans living with disabilities, or indeed people who are not suffering from mental incapacity or physical incapacity. It's about helping them, and in a great way in terms of the service they provide. There were many people at their open day, from Mates4Mates to the RSL. The local media were there and many organisations, including councils and the like. But Sam and Annette have done a great job. I came across a variety of people from my electorate who were there learning leathercraft. It was about dealing with the incapacity that they'd experienced and how they had transitioned out of the military.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to speak on this Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022, to support people living with incapacity who are veterans—people who are, indeed, part of the charity of Bootstraps in the Lockyer Valley. It also helps people from Ipswich who transition. We owe a debt of gratitude to our Defence Force personnel, veterans and their families, and we have a solemn duty to look after them. The recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report on veterans' wellbeing shows that former defence personnel are a tremendous asset to our society. It's our duty to provide the necessary support, like Bootstraps in the Lockyer Valley, to veterans and their families who leave the Defence Force, enabling them to contribute to our community in many ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends by one year a four-year pilot which is supporting eligible veterans in full-time study, from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. We're doing this really because of the ignorance, idleness and inertia of the former coalition government, which, not just with this bill but with other bills, failed to bring it into the House of Representatives or the Senate in time to be passed in the 46th Parliament. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is sitting there on the bench and he has a big job to do, because he's going to have to pass bills that have been sitting from the last parliament which the coalition didn't pass and should have passed. This was a budget measure—let's not forget about that. I accept the words from the member for Herbert and I believe he's genuine in what he said, but the truth of the matter is that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in this chamber today is dealing with a budget measure from last year which created uncertainty in the lives of veterans and their communities. Hundreds of veterans—370—participating in the program were left in the lurch and out of pocket, copping an immediate cut of 25 per cent to their payment. If the previous coalition government under Prime Minister Morrison had got around to actually doing its job and passed the bill these veterans would not have been out of pocket since 30 June 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall as a local MP and also as the former shadow minister receiving representations from concerned veterans about this measure before the last election, so I'm pleased that the Albanese Labor government is now in a position to fix up the mess created by the Morrison government in this area. This bill reinstates the program and allows the calculation of incapacity payments to these veterans, once again, to be based on 100 per cent, not 75 per cent, of their pre-injury earnings. It's imperative the legislation be passed. It is a matter of urgency to financially support veterans. We're here today because of the failure and inaction of the former coalition government. We're about giving veterans certainty and financially supporting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill complements the work that the minister will do in the $24 million Veterans' Employment Program, which we announced in the last campaign. It was a comprehensive veterans package. Too much of what we've done in the past has been about awards, and not enough has been about concrete work on the ground to help veterans in the transition to civilian life. We know many veterans struggle to find work when they transition to civilian life, and that can lead to other problems—mental health issues, homelessness, incarceration and even suicide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a royal commission, which Labor strongly supported and had to drag those opposite kicking and screaming into doing. We saw the interim report. Those recommendations, if picked up by this government, I'm very confident, will go a long way to supporting veterans who are living with incapacity and who need to be transitioned into civilian life in an appropriate and supported way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Housing Australia Future Fund has $30 million geared to veterans' homelessness services. One in 10 people who slept rough or slept as a homeless person last night was a veteran. It's not enough to give platitudes and honour people on Anzac Day; we've got to support them in practical ways, and that's why it's important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the royal commission picked up on the legislative framework. It said that legislation that deals with incapacity and deals with veterans' compensation and rehabilitation needs to be coalesced into one usable form of bill—a code, shall we say—that the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act can be included in as well. Those veterans advocates helping veterans living with incapacity—in my electorate, for example, in the Ipswich Railway sub-branch, in Kilcoy, in Lowood or elsewhere—do a great job, but they're dealing with a piece of legislation that's challenging. So today we've got a bill that will help veterans in incapacity, and we should pick it up and support it in the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important to do this, and it's important that bills that we pass in this chamber are not tokenistic. Too much of the legislation that was brought in by the previous coalition was tokenistic. It lacked clear goals and targets and evaluation, provided little incentive for employers and relied on goodwill and PR. There were not enough practical supports for employers and practical supports for veterans to transition into community life and into serious employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very happy to see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs convene a series of round tables on veterans' employment in the lead-up to last week's Jobs and Skills Summit. There were some great outcomes, and I commend the minister for that. The great outcomes for veterans from the summit include a one-off income credit so that veterans on a service pension over retirement age can earn more before their pension is reduced. For working-age veterans, there will be additional digital apprenticeships in the Australian Public Service targeting disadvantaged groups, including veterans, providing more jobs and training opportunities. That's really critical, particularly if veterans are living with any form of incapacity, physical or mental. The reality is that veterans and defence partners are a highly skilled yet relatively untapped workforce, and don't we need them now! We need to do more things like we're doing today—boosting recognition of their skills and experience and getting them into good-quality jobs. That's absolutely critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also support them in veterans hubs around the country, including in my electorate, in the Ipswich to Springfield area, which was sadly neglected. Labor pushed that, year after year after year, and the coalition refused to do it. We even had then Prime Minister Morrison coming to my electorate but refusing to announce one in my electorate, even though he was announcing them around the state and around the country. That's just another aspect of supporting veterans living with incapacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the minister will be discussing the recommendations of the royal commission with veterans' ministers in states and territories. I urge all those people to make submissions to the royal commission. They should be encouraged to do so by 13 October 2023. I note the final report will be handed down on 24 June 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fantastic to see the willingness of veterans ministers around the country in the states and territories to get on board with programs to support veterans' education and training. I personally saw at the launch of the Student Veteran Support Program at the Australian Catholic University campus on the north side of Brisbane how important that was to help veterans in that transition. Tertiary education is critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, it is initiatives like this pilot program that we're debating today that will support veterans financially and boost their capacity and their mental health as they transition from the military. There are a lot of things we need to do. The previous government dropped the ball and we saw at the royal commission the $430 million that was cut from veterans entitlements and out of the budget. The previous ministers, Minister Chester and Minister Gee, failed to disclose those cuts that they had to disclose at the royal commission. We saw the former minister threatening to resign before the last budget. You talk about transparency and accountability. We need to do better, and we will do better. I'm very confident that the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs has veterans at his heart. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is part of a suite of policies of this government, including 500 full-time frontline staff, ending the privatisation, outsourcing and labour hire in the Department of Veterans' Affairs that were perpetrated and perpetuated by those opposite. It's very important that we get those full-time experienced public servants to assess those claims. This legislation is important and is part of a suite that the minister will deliver to help veterans around the country. We need a better future for our current serving ADF personnel and a better future for former defence personnel and their families. That's why this bill is so important today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282306" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak in favour of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022, but I don't want to politicise the issues at hand. I think this is far too serious an issue for any political gain or political snipe. However, I want to give people a better understanding of the implications and the background—the underlying issues for many of the paradigms talked about within the legislation. This legislation talks about our MRCA, our Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, and our DRCA, our defence related claims act. The technical parameters of the bill were detailed by previous speakers. It allows our defence veterans to be paid their full compensation whilst still studying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former military instructor I took young kids off the bus and turned them into soldiers. It's from that perspective that I speak today. These aren't just any kids. These are our best. They are chosen through recruiting and tested. These are the top two per cent of Australia's youth. They're motivated, because they put their hand up of their own volition and took themselves into a defence recruiting office where they raised their hand and swore an oath to our country, its Queen and its people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They then go to their recruit training establishment. I speak of Kapooka, the 1st Recruit Training Battalion. Once they come to us we take them from that civilian way of life to a very different way of life. It's a way of life that is unique. It's very difficult for those who haven't served to understand and contemplate the changes that go on within a young person's mind and heart to change them from a civilian to a soldier. We must remember at all times that our role in the military is to keep Australia safe using lethal force, to seek out and close with our enemy, to kill or capture him. These are the lessons we teach our young people, and they're very difficult lessons to get across.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also teach our young people that the person on their right and the person on their left are the most important and that the value of the team is far greater than the value of the individual. Again, this is a very difficult concept to get across to average Joe Blow on the street. But, once that transition is made and that trust is placed in that person on their right and their left, that's a very valuable bond, and that young person's life changes forever. Many people ask why. Why would you trust that person so much? Why would you give your life for that person on your right or your left? The answer is very simple: it's because that person on your right or your left would give their life for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't help but think of when the member for Herbert talked about the tribe. He used the word 'tribe' to describe what we have as an organisation—that trust and that bond, those changes that I talked about earlier, that we have in our military, right across the entire ADF. But, once those bonds are made, when someone leaves Defence, then they have to leave that tribe. In the member for Herbert's case, he had no choice. In my case, I was medically discharged after 20 years service. Once you have to leave due to a medical issue—to leave the big tribe that you've grown so accustomed to and that you think so much of—that's a very different transformation. That's the transformation that this bill plays a very important part in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned before that knowledge is power. Knowledge is key. Knowledge builds confidence. I talked briefly about the change in those young individuals that we get off the bus at Kapooka. You can see them after their recruit training course. They're a different person. They stick their chest out; they pull their shoulders back; they're confident. They're confident in their team and their mates. They're proud of being in the Army. They're proud of serving the country. They're proud to protect that person on their right or their left. You can see it in their eyes, and you can feel it when you walk into a training area and you've got young recruits. After a while, you can feel that culture, and it's very strong. But once that tribe is broken and that individual leaves the tribe, then they feel as if they're an outcast in life, and that's where the problems start. Bills like this help give that confidence, through training, through rehabilitation and through taking that purpose and changing and shaping that purpose into a different purpose. That's where we can unlock the future of that young person's success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other elements, I think, that come into play when we talk about transitioning. I talked briefly about the importance that that training and knowledge brings—training like what we're talking about within the confines of the bill—but I also want to make the very succinct point that families play an important part in this. A veteran's family is going to be the mechanism, the conduit, by which that veteran makes that transformation. As a government and as a nation, I think we need to embrace the entire family unit. I think that that soldier, sailor or aviator's spouse, their child or their children, and their family are going to be their future. When we start talking about transition and rehabilitation and training, I think we should involve the entire family unit. At the end of the day, that family unit is going to be the new tribe. It's going to be the connecter between their military service and their new service, which, of course, will be meaningful employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear—and I've heard them here today—anecdotal stories about veterans who do it tough, and sadly many do. But, as has been proven time and time again, the vast majority of our defence personnel transition very seamlessly. They transition very smoothly. In fact, when they enter their new world—their new role, their new job, their civilian employment—they transition so well that they excel. They have a skill set that is second to none. They have, over the duration of their service, built up things like teamwork, leadership skills and communication skills. They understand what integrity really means. They understand what it's like to work in big teams and small teams. They understand their commander's intent and the importance of understanding what your boss wants from you. They are very proud people; they take pride in what they do. They like to see a good job done, a proper job done, a professional job done. So my point is: to all prospective employers out there right across the nation, employing a veteran is good for your business. It really is. If we can better translate the skills, knowledge and attitudes that they learnt in the big tribe of the military into the industry-centric language that most bosses would understand, then they'd have a veteran in a heartbeat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the state of Tasmania, where I'm from, I'm pleased to say that we've delivered $7½ million for veterans' wellness centres, with $2½ million of that money spent on the North West veterans' hub. We talk about success stories and making a transition—well, the guy that runs this particular veterans' hub is a guy that I served with. He was an ammunition technician, a major in the Army, an officer. For retraining, for resettlement, he decided that he would stick his hand up and become a general practitioner. He wanted to be a GP; he wanted to be a doctor. He wanted to help people. So he did. And now he's one of the finest GPs that we've got in the great state of Tassie, and he's helping us out with this North West veterans' clinic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He's teamed up with other great organisations, like Open Arms, like Soldier On, like Mates4Mates and many others. What that clinic does is provide a way of life and a mechanism by which veterans can pre-empt the rigours of that change. They arm them with the skills, knowledge and attitude that they need for their new mission, for their new role. They give them purpose again, and, in doing so, they encourage that confidence. And the results speak for themselves! The incredible amount of positive feedback that we get from that organisation really makes us proud—proud that we can provide that support. And it's given by, as I said, veterans. Veterans are helping veterans, and you'll never find a better scenario.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to refer also to another organisation which works with the North West veterans' hub, and that is Disaster Relief Australia. It's run by a young bloke called Geoff Evans, and he's an ex-military engineer. He's got a volunteer organisation which helps out in many areas during floods, fires and other disasters. In fact, we had a terrible storm in Tassie some months ago, and 60 of these volunteers were down there helping people in communities, cutting trees off houses and helping people who couldn't ordinarily help themselves. The teamwork and camaraderie and esprit de corps that existed in their group took me back to my Army days. By doing that, the mentorship and the peer support that existed was therapy in itself, and the end result was that the community was proud of the help that they'd received from Disaster Relief Australia. I can't speak highly enough of them. But it also put pride on the faces of those ex-Defence personnel, those veterans, who did the work, and that's what it's all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess the main point that I want to get across today is that family is going to unlock the future for our veterans, and everybody needs a family. I think that knowledge is key, and I think that knowledge is empowering. I think that the more training and the more knowledge we can give our veterans, then the better their chance of success will be.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as a nation, I want to reiterate exactly what the member for Herbert said, and that is: the time for feeling sorry for veterans is over. We should not pity our veterans. We should be proud of them. There are veterans who, yes, will tug at our heartstrings, with the extreme nature of some injuries that still exist. But, for the most part, our veterans transition very well. They're an asset, so give them a go. If a veteran comes knocking on your door, at least give them a go because they come highly recommended and with a set of skills that are second to none.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to say that the royal commission has been difficult. I want to thank every single last witness who has given evidence to that royal commission. I want to recognise the hardships they would have had to endure and the gumption they would have had to build up before they went and gave that evidence. To relive that trauma would have been unbelievably difficult. I want to recognise that formally. I want to recognise that from my own perspective and from the parliament's perspective. I want to thank you for that. I want you to recognise that the work that you've done in doing so will save lives. I can't thank you enough for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great bill. It comes at the end of a long road, and I'm pleased to see it's finally coming to fruition. We can't fix veterans' issues overnight; I think the royal commission will identify that. But we're moving in the right direction. I want to look across the chamber today at the minister and I want him to be reassured that, if there is anything veterans from this side can do, he has our support. At the end of the day, our aim is to look after our fine community of veterans.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I'm of course speaking in support of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022. I'm glad that this bill is receiving bipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the previous government let veterans down in a number of ways. They resisted calls for a royal commission into veteran suicide, and, of course, we know their pointless staffing cap on the Department of Veterans' Affairs has meant that we now have a crisis in terms of the backlog of compensation claims that exist in the department, which is causing serious mental health issues for a number of veterans throughout the country. The great shame about that crisis we have developed in veterans' affairs is that it could have been avoided if the previous government hadn't let ideology get in the way of the management of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. By putting a staffing cap on the number of people that could work on resolving compensation claims for veterans, they artificially ensured that we had a crisis develop. It will now be up to the Albanese Labor government to try to fix that crisis, and that is what we are trying to do. It's a commitment that we have to veterans that should be shared by all of us in this place because we all have a duty to look after those who have served our nation, and that means being there for the occasion, when it counts, for Australian Defence Force personnel, veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular bill resumes access to the beneficial calculation of incapacity payments for eligible veterans. For veterans undergoing rehabilitation, we know that ongoing financial security can be a concern. A lack of financial support can impede their rehabilitation, particularly when they're working towards long-term rehabilitation goals such as engaging in tertiary education. The Maintaining Incapacity Payments for Veterans Studying pilot program was launched in 2018 to enable incapacity payments to continue to be paid up to 100 per cent of normal earning for veterans undertaking full-time study as part of the DVA-approved rehabilitation plan. Normally those payments would have stepped down to 75 per cent after 45 weeks. The aim of the pilot is to ensure veterans who are undertaking full-time study as part of a DVA vocational rehabilitation program receive ongoing financial support equivalent to the income they would have earned had they remained in the Australian Defence Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Provision was made in the 2022 budget for a one-year extension of the pilot program until 30 June 2023. Unfortunately, under the previous government, the necessary legislation wasn't passed in time to extend the pilot before it expired on 30 June this year. The department has attempted to contact all of the veterans in the pilot program—there are around 417—to discuss continued support by DVA following the expiry of the pilot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence, Veterans' and Families' Acute Support Package Bill was introduced here on 3 August to improve the existing family support package, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. This package will expand eligibility for families and widowed partners under all three acts, including by removing requirements for a veteran to be participating in rehabilitation or to have rendered warlike service, by providing greater flexibility by introducing an annual financial cap on services rather than a limit on each category of support and by including more practical services that help a family to function well. These practical services include activities such as child care; counselling and financial counselling; household assistance, meal preparation and cleaning; services to build capacity such as relationship skills and mental health first aid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already seen significant progress in helping to build this capacity. Last month, I was proud to announce a partnership between DVA, the Department of Defence and Phoenix Australia Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, which led to a world-first research project on the development of an innovative new treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The research explored a new form of intensive exposure therapy, and results showed it to be as effective as a standard treatment whilst offering greater lifestyle choices for veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The improvement comes in the length of the rehabilitation course. Ordinarily, a veteran undertaking PTSD therapy and rehabilitation would enter into a 10-week course, undertaking a session once a week over 10 weeks. This study looked at the benefits of compressing that course into a two-week period of attendance every day over 10 days, and the results were significant. They found that the outcomes were the same, but, importantly, the dropout rate from this particular form of therapy was greatly reduced by the compressed nature of the course. Up to 40 per cent fewer participants dropped out of the course when they undertook the two-week intensive course compared to the longer 10-week course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that our veterans experience PTSD at higher rates than the general population, and that's why we're committed to offering veterans experiencing PTSD the best range of treatments possible. This Rapid Exposure Supporting Trauma Recovery, or RESTORE trial as it's known, investigated a new method of delivering that PTSD training over a two-week period. The RESTORE trial found that the intensive exposure therapy is equally as effective as the standard therapy and the dropout rate was lower, as I said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The innovative new therapy, which has been developed in Australia, is now being offered to veterans and their families through Open Arms, the veterans and families counselling service. Open Arms provides these high-quality, evidence based, accessible and tailored healthcare packages that respond to the unique nature of military service and its impacts on veterans and their families. It's another example of how the Albanese government is committed to veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence, Veterans' and Families' Acute Support Package Bill will deliver more flexible support in the nature of that RESTORE trial quickly to vulnerable families. The bill goes further than the one introduced by the previous government by providing review rights and extending support to former partners. We have an obligation to ensure all of our Defence Force personnel are kept safe here and abroad, mentally and physically. The same goes for when they come home, and the same goes for when they retire from the service. These changes will help deliver more positive outcomes for many defence and veteran communities, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  I wish to sum up this debate, if I may speak briefly. Firstly, I'd like to thank the members who have contributed to the debate on the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill 2022 this evening. In particular, I'd like to thank all parties in the House for their support of this bill and for its prompt passage. And I thank the honourable members for their commitment to supporting our service personnel, veterans and families, especially the contributions that we have heard tonight from those who have served in our defence forces. I'd like to acknowledge the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for New England, who spoke about the service of his grandfather and his recently deceased father, and also about the national obligation to our veterans that falls upon us. In particular, he picked up on the point that it's the way that we treat our veterans and support them after their service that will be reflected in our capacity to recruit to our defence forces as well, especially at a time when we are seeking to significantly grow the size of our Defence Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for McEwen made the very interesting observation that despite his service in the cadets it proved to him that he did not have a future career in the Defence Force because of his desire to avoid having to continually polish boots! But he did speak very favourably of the organisation that he is aware of, Vets in Construction, and that organisation's support for the employment of veterans—their support in the construction industry and the importance of employment generally for our veterans. He too wanted to see better support for our veterans, particularly to make sure that they don't feel—as veterans had said to him that they did feel—that they were, and had been in the past, ignored. Of course, our government is committed to making sure that no veteran feels that they are being ignored by their government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for Herbert for his contribution to the debate this evening. He spoke, and not for the first time in this House, about the 'bad time', as he described it, that he had from his injuries both physical and mental. He spoke about the importance of connection to and continuance of having purpose in one's life and in what one does post service with the Defence Force. It was why he joined the Defence Force and it was what he was looking for after it. It was that which showed him the importance of education and being able to see a different future that would also provide purpose. He made the very astute observation, that was repeated by many—and which we do need to reinforce and remember—that not all vets are broken. Indeed, the report last week from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare did highlight the many positives for our veterans and our veteran community in the way in which they exceed the general Australian population when it comes to their rates of employment, their homeownership and their income levels, and that is a good thing. It is a very good thing and we should celebrate that and continue to promote that. But of course that doesn't mean we can ignore those who do need special and additional assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Blair spoke about veterans' charity work in his own electorate and the great work that they do in supporting the community there, and the very important aspect of making sure that what we talk about here and in other places is not where it ends—that we have practical supports put in place to support our veterans. I very much want to acknowledge the work of the member for Blair, as the shadow minister for veterans' affairs during the last term of parliament, in putting together a policy suite that we took to the election and that I now have the honour of seeking to implement. It is all about providing practical support measures for our defence personnel, veterans and families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Braddon also spoke of his own experience in the Defence Force, the work that he did in training soldiers and the special bond that exists between soldiers. This repeated the words of the member for Herbert in describing them as a 'tribe' and the difficulty of transition—in leaving the tribe and the need to undertake a transformation for the soldier as they transition out of defence. He also referred to something which we absolutely embrace on this side, as the government: embracing the family unit and its importance to a successful transition out of defence. It's partly why we have made the decision to refer to what were previously 'wellbeing hubs' as Veterans and Families Hubs. This is because it's about supporting not only the veterans but also families, because getting that right is so vital to seeing a positive transition into civilian life and an ongoing successful transition to civilian life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also spoke about something that's very close to us over here, which is the importance of highlighting to business the skills that veterans bring to the private sector—skills that they've developed in the Defence Force. They are soft skills like leadership, teamwork, being able to work under pressure, having agility—things that we do want to make sure that our employers are very well aware of—as well as the hard skills they have developed in Defence, whether that's in a trade or in some other technical area. It's why we committed, in the last election, $24 million to developing a veterans' employment program that is partly about highlighting these very important soft and hard skills that our veterans bring and are able to provide to businesses who may employ them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kingsford Smith—and I want to thank him for his great work and commitment to our veterans as the Assistant Minister for Defence and Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs—spoke about an excellent program that Defence, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Phoenix have been working on: a new PTSD treatment, which is now available through Open Arms, the mental health and counselling support service for our veterans. That is a new program. We're very happy to support it. It's proving to be very efficacious. In particular, as he referred to, because of the way it operates, the drop-out rates from the program are much lower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this feeds into how we as a government are making sure our veterans and their families are well supported and looked after as they transition from the Australian Defence Force, and this is an important task and responsibility of government. Indeed, it is a solemn commitment that we must make. The previous government did not, before the dissolution of the 46th Parliament, introduce legislation to deal with the issues that are being dealt with by this bill, and that resulted in financial uncertainty and distress for some 370 veterans. The Albanese Labor government has prioritised this important legislation. This legislation will ensure our commitment to veteran employment, as it supports education opportunities to upskill veterans who currently have a reduced ability to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment (Incapacity Payments) Bill will resume access to the beneficial calculation of incapacity payments for eligible veterans. This means that eligible veterans—those undertaking approved study under a rehabilitation plan—will again have their incapacity payments restored to 100 per cent of pre-injury earnings. The lack of action on this pre the election has meant that veterans receiving such payments had them unnecessarily reduced from 1 July, but this bill also backdates payments for those veterans, making good on the loss they've sustained because of the inaction of the previous government. We're committed to delivering a comprehensive veterans' employment program, as I referred to before, to support personnel as they transition to civilian life. This program that we are debating in this legislation is a key part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's initiatives like this that not only support a veteran and their family financially but can support a veteran's mental health as they undergo their transition from service. We have an obligation to ensure all our defence personnel are kept safe here and abroad, mentally and physically. The same goes for when they come home. This pilot program will ensure that veterans can continue their education as they transition from service, ultimately increasing their capacity and, indeed, opportunities for employment, which is a key predictor of success as they return to civilian life. It will ensure they are best placed to succeed. It will help address some of the issues that have been presented to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide and that are referred to in its interim report of only a few weeks ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our serving personnel put themselves in harm's way to protect our national interest. We want our service personnel, veterans and families, to know that Australia is proud of them and that our country will always be there for them, and so I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  As a constructive opposition, we will assess proposals on their merits, but we will not be giving the Albanese government a blank cheque on anything, including this bill. Whilst we accept that Jobs and Skills Australia will be established, we are sceptical of the new arrangements given there is still no clarity on either how the organisation will be structured or its full remit and responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government introduced the Jobs and Skills Australia Bill 2022, the JSA bill, and the Jobs and Skills Australia (National Skills Commissioner Repeal) Bill 2022 in the last sitting. We note this legislation gives effect to one of Labor's election pledges: to establish the Jobs and Skills Australia, or JSA, agency. The government's stated objectives are to drive vocational education and training, VET, and to strengthen workforce planning by establishing an organisation that includes employers, unions and the training and education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that this is the first of two tranches of legislation regarding JSA. This bill merely establishes the agency within the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. It's unfortunate that the Labor Party were not able to outline the full remit and scope of this agency, or how it will operate, before they pressed ahead with establishing a new part of the bureaucracy. As a result, over 100 days into this new government, we still don't know how this purportedly vital organisation will function. There are also some worrying signals coming out of the government when it comes to the role of the unions in the JSA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While delivering better information, coordination and leadership of Australia's workforce and skills needs is a noble aspiration, this function is already being provided by the National Skills Commission, established by the former coalition government in 2020. The NSC currently, under the leadership of National Skills Commissioner Adam Boyton, monitors, reports, researches and analyses employment dynamics across different groups, industries, occupations and regions. It considers how changes in the labour market will impact jobs and how those changes will impact the economy's education and skills needs. It also has an important role in simplifying and strengthening Australia's VET system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Skills and Training has actually stated that JSA will build on the NSC and has, given the resource profile, indicated that NSC staff will come across to JSA. In fact, we are told that JSA will be cost neutral because the existing funding for NSC will cover the work for JSA. So is the new agency doing more than the old one, or is it doing the same amount of work? Either Labor are just rebranding the NSC, or they have discovered a magic pudding that will pay for all the new work the agency will apparently be charged with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be watching, because we do know that the NSC has already done exceptional work. The NSC was a key part of how the Liberals and Nationals got the Australian skills sector on an even keel. The Liberals and Nationals cleaned up the mess across our skills sector caused by Labor when they were last in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're over 100 days into the Albanese government, and what has become increasingly clear is that, rather than wasting not even a single day when it comes to skills, they've in fact wasted every single day. The Labor Party inherited a booming skills and training sector from the coalition government. There was real momentum in skills and training, thanks to the Liberals and Nationals. And what have Labor done? They've introduced uncertainty into apprenticeships. They've signalled they may cut skills funding for apprentices to pay for their pet projects. The few announcements that they have made have been delayed, to align with the much-hyped Jobs and Skills Summit, where the Prime Minister announced an additional 180,000 fee-free TAFE places for 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It sounds good but belies the truth. We've since learned the Prime Minister misled the Jobs and Skills Summit. His much-vaunted training blitz is nothing more than marketing spin, with the vast majority of funded positions not new or additional at all. Reports in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> suggest, of the 180,000 committed places, over 66 per cent already exist and will only be further subsidised. Just 45,000 will be new, and all of them were already announced as part of Labor's fee-free TAFE pre-election commitment—most incredibly, 15,000 aged-care places announced in the coalition government's March budget through its JobTrainer Fund. So the Labor Party have re-announced 15,000 new places that we announced when we were in government in March. The Prime Minister's big skills reveal at his summit is a facade, which is fitting for a summit that was ultimately run by unions, for unions, with predetermined outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is also concerning is the Prime Minister's explicit statement that funding will go to public training providers only. This has sent a shiver through the industry-led training providers, because we know private RTOs do 70 to 80 per cent of training across our VET sector, and they're estimated to train 79 per cent of all women across the skills system. We need an even-handed approach to the entire skills sector that provides choice for our next generation. We would be extremely concerned if JSA embedded a bias for any part of the skills sector, so we need to safeguard and prevent unions from dominating this agency and turning it into an entity that only backs public providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want this agency to succeed because, if it hits the mark, Jobs and Skills Australia will play an important role in the skills system. We know this because, right now, the NSC plays a vital role. If Labor are intent on abolishing a body doing good work for another body that could do good work, any failures, any bad outcomes, any delays to the progress we were making will all be on their heads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's record on skills is embarrassing. Everything the Labor Party has ever touched on skills has made things worse. When they were last in government, Labor delivered systemwide policy failures. Apprenticeship numbers took a nosedive. The reality is, when it comes to skills policy, Labor failed. When they last left office, apprentice and trainee numbers were in freefall, with the number in training collapsing by 22 per cent, or 111,300, between June 2012 and June 2013. This was a direct result of funding cuts by the Gillard Labor government in 2012. They oversaw widespread rorting of training incentive payments that were supposed to help apprentices get a skill but, instead, just subsidised existing workers' salaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's VET FEE-HELP disaster saw the reputation of the Australian skills system hit rock bottom as tens of thousands of Australians were loaded up with debt for doing courses that would never land them a job. The taxpayer is still picking up the tab for this enormous public failure, a tab which is now over $3.3 billion. The scheme, established by the Labor government in 2008 and expanded in 2012, was plagued by systemwide rorting, with some training providers exploiting loose rules and charging students substantial debts for training that they never undertook or benefited from. It also targeted people with disabilities and substance abuse issues, public housing residents, non-English speakers and others with offers of free laptops and other incentives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories are harrowing, such as of a young single mother who travelled to Cairns to enrol in what soon became apparent was a dodgy diploma taught by a teacher that didn't have a clue. She racked up $12,000 in debt, with nothing to show for it. There are literally thousands of stories like this. And who presided over all these failures? None other than the former—and now returned—skills minister, the member for Gorton. So what could go wrong? I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 75 years, Australian Lions members have come together as ordinary men and women within their clubs and aligned with their motto of 'We serve' and they've done extraordinary things for their local communities across the states and territories of Australia, and, with their fellow Lions from across the world, they support those in need whenever disaster strikes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 months, as we have come out of lockdowns, Australian Lions members have served 3.8 million people across 35,000 completed service activities, volunteering 1.1 million hours, and they have donated $9.3 million back to their communities. For most of us, all we know about Lions is that they are great at cooking up and serving a sausage in bread, but there is so much more to know about these men and women who serve throughout our communities. Lions across Australia come together as members who are passionate about volunteering and making a difference in their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Lions member in Australia and across the world pays a membership fee to cover the costs of running the association. This ensures that every single dollar raised through fundraising efforts donated by the community goes to the causes, which is a tribute to every member of Lions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lions members are always there to support their communities when disaster strikes. Australia's first Lions club, in Lismore, was there on the ground in its 75th year supporting its community during the floods, along with other local clubs, whilst Lions clubs across Australia ran fundraising events and tin-rattled, raising funds that went directly to those clubs serving those in need during the floods and beyond today. Since Cyclone Tracy, the Australian Lions Foundation has donated many millions of dollars towards disaster recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My own Lions V5 district club supported the community of Kalorama in the Dandenong in June 2021 after the disastrous windstorms destroyed one in three homes. In my own electorate of McEwen, immediately after the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009, the Whittlesea Lions set up a camp area for displaced families to stay and Lions members cooked many, many meals for them with the assistance of local and distant Lions clubs across the state and country. Those families were provided with desperately needed clothing and other vital essentials. As the weeks went on, Lions members set up tool trailers with fencing equipment and mobile tool libraries, which my good friend Alan Haywood was central to. This provided valuable resources that allowed affected community members to start the process of clearing and rebuilding homes for families and communities. There are countless more stories where Lions members and clubs have continued to step in and serve those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lions members support a number of important youth programs. Lions clubs sponsor Leo clubs, which comprise of either schoolchildren as alpha Leo members or young adults as omega Leo members who serve and develop community service and leadership skills. The Lions Youth of the Year Program is another fantastic program that is designed to foster, encourage and develop the leadership qualities of our youth in conjunction with other citizenship qualities at the age when they are about to enter the fields of higher education or employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lions from across Australia and internationally have five global causes. These global causes present significant challenges to humanity, and Lions members believe it's their turn to meet them. They are children's cancer, diabetes, vision, hunger and, of course, the environment. As well as these global causes, Lions from across Australia have contributed to our country in so many ways, like their involvement in the cochlear implant and the Gardasil vaccine. The contribution Lions members from across Australia have made and continue to make within our communities continues to be significant. The 75th anniversary campaign is based on the theme 'Always'. Lions have been there for our communities. They stand ready to help and will always be there in the future when needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to Lions members that the diversity of their club mirrors their community, and they're so proud to have a number of growing specialty clubs, ranging from young volunteers in the Leo clubs to virtual clubs, ethnic clubs, autism clubs and a range of other special interest clubs that are being established. I would like to thank and acknowledge this wonderful group of Lions volunteers, past and present, in this 75th year of service, for their work over this time and for always being there, now and into the future, to support those in need. As I wear my Lions tie, I truly remember they truly serve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I'd like to take the liberty tonight just to use this adjournment debate to acknowledge two very special things that are happening in my community at the moment. The first is that the East Lismore Hockey Club are celebrating their 75th year as a club this year. It was established in the late forties to form a breakaway hockey team to enter the Far North Coast reserve-grade competition, and the women's side joined a year or two later. Today, 'Easties', as they are known, are one of the strongest clubs in the Far North Coast competition. Several current and former members have played for Australia, including former Kookaburra Grant Smith, who won bronze at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. To celebrate their 75th year, they've had all games from junior levels to seniors reserves, both men and women, played on their home field in Goonellabah on 5 and 6 August. They called it the 'festival of the Easties'. They've had many contributors to hockey in the region. But the standout, a wonderful community contributor, is Clint Mallett, who was inducted as a life member into Far North Coast Hockey Inc. for his work on and off the field, and particularly for his role in 1987 as the founding secretary of Far North Coast Hockey Inc. A great lover of the game is Clint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to the committee: president Daniel Hughes, secretary Sonya Buchanan, treasurer Jo Mackney, vice-president Andrew Helmood, June Blunn, Clint Mallett, Roxanne Tickle, Demi Flynn and Jane Parrish. They are a great club. They do a lot of good work in our community besides teaching people to play hockey. They are a great community organisation, and I thank them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I'd like to acknowledge—as there are lot of sporting finals at the moment—the grand final winners from the weekend senior rugby league competition. At the North Coast Group 2 Rugby League Competition that was played on Sunday, the South Grafton Rebels—go the Rebels!—played the Orara Valley Axemen. The Rebels came out on top, 36 to 8. I want to congratulate the team, coached by Ronald Gordon: Keiron Johnson-Heron, Luke French, Nick McGrady, Tom McGrady, Brian Quinlan, Hughie Stanley, Jordan Gallagher, Lewis Cooper, Cooper Makings, Jack Pitkin, TJ Walker, Grant Brown, Grant Stevens, Ryan Binge, Luke Walker, Tyrhys Brown and Aussie Cooper, and the reserves, Damon Kirby, Waylon Caldwell and Keaton Stutt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting story about this is that, while the Orara Valley Axemen missed on the day, they had taken out the minor premiership, and they're coached by the former NRL player Sam Burgess, who came to the club after retiring from the NRL in 2019. He helped resurrect the Axemen—they'd had a few bad years. He built a great team. They won the minor premiership, energised new fans and got great crowds to the games, as well, which is a great celebration for them this year. So to their team—Liam Dunn, Ronan Singleton, Luke Beaumont, Lathan Hutchinson-Walters, Steven Cetinich, Buddy Hart, Dan Robinson, Cain Bunt, Zac Makelim, Matt Wakefield, Ryan Gill, Macauley Dawson, Justin Hull, Jedaiah Katal, Harry Davey, Vikram Atwal, Oscar Watson, Alex Bunt and Jarrod Hall—congratulations. I congratulate the Rebels on their win and the Axemen for having had a great year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:38</span>):  Reflecting on my father's wisdom yesterday for Father's Day, I remember him always saying, 'Don't worry about the fog. When it clears, it'll always be a beautiful, sunny day.' That wasn't the thought that I had last Thursday as I sat at Newcastle Airport, looking out into a real pea souper where you couldn't see much beyond your arm, and waited to get on my flight here to Canberra, which was also enveloped in fog. I was desperate to come to Canberra to be part of the jobs summit. Well, the fog started to clear enough, we took off, and I was able to land and get to the summit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that analogy made me reflect on the summit itself. It seems to me that, particularly for the last 10 years, we have been enveloped in a fog of industrial relations. Among the people who attended the summit, there was a great variety of business titans, of union leaders, of community advocates and of progressive forward-thinkers. Whilst there's still disagreement on some elements of the Jobs and Skills Summit outcomes, one of the key things that was agreed upon was that our system needs to change, particularly our system relating to industrial relations. Looking at wages, looking at bargaining and looking at the outcome for Australian workers, everyone in that room agreed, largely, that we could do better—that we must, in fact, do better. And, as promised, the Albanese government isn't wasting a minute. It was a very special and productive feeling in that room, and I think that unless you were there it was very difficult to get the feeling that everyone had. It didn't come across necessarily on the live broadcast, but in that room there was a real willingness to make change. I jokingly said to a couple of the participants, 'What a shame we can't draw up a phial of the willingness that's in this room at the moment and use it to inoculate people, perhaps, when that willingness dwindles in future months!' But it was there and it was palpable, and I did consider it a great privilege to be at the jobs summit on Thursday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we bring industry, unions, workers and the government together we are seeking a more cohesive future for Australia. As a union member myself, I was extremely proud to see 20 union representatives in the room. I was also so pleased to see people who come from very diverse backgrounds talking to each other. As someone was talking about in one of my meetings today, there were people who should be working together that didn't even have each other's phone numbers. So I feel that the summit meant so much more than just a talkfest, as it has been labelled by many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am looking forward to seeing the outcomes that are going to result from the summit. One of the immediate wins that we had—and I was particularly pleased to see it—was the initiative coming out of it on the Friday allowing seniors and pensioners to earn $4,000 more this financial year. I think they are an enormous well of largely untapped potential in a very tight jobs market. These people have a lifetime of experience and skills and, as we know, 70 is the new 50 and 80 is the new 60! They're energised, they want to contribute and we know that they can contribute. It's great to think that the Albanese Labor government is tapping into that capital, that labour, and that we can put people who want to be working and earning a few dollars more in their later years to productive use. I think that's just a great thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes too we see that when that happens, obviously, the interaction between older workers and younger workers can be really fantastic. The summit was a success and I'm really so pleased to have been part of it.</span>

In terms of disadvantage and need, we have three times the Indigenous population of Victoria, we have an older demographic, our weekly income is two-thirds of that of the average Victorian and health needs are higher. We have 50 per cent higher asthma sufferers; higher numbers of those with cancer and heart disease; and 25 per cent higher mental health needs than the average Victorian, and yet we have fewer GPs. We have almost 20 per cent fewer doctors per 100,000 people than Melbourne.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a disturbing story to tell and will be using my parliamentary privilege to do so. Tristar Medical Group was established by Dr Khaled El-Sheikh in 2003 and offered bulk billing at its clinics. The ABC reports that, at its peak, Tristar operated 59 clinics across Australia, with 440 employees and 165 doctors. But in the past five years, 35 clinics have shut down. In 2019, Tristar was under significant financial stress and had been so for the previous 18 months. At the time Dr Khaled El-Sheikh stated, 'However, I am guaranteeing you that payments and all moneys owed for services rendered are secure now and into the future.' A credit report into Tristar's main operating company by Equifax shows it was deemed a high credit risk. A payslip for a Tristar doctor, obtained by the ABC, shows they have been paid under a separate company name with a different ABN. This reporting included that doctors had gone weeks and even months without pay, and that staff on temporary visas were nervous to speak up for fear of repercussions. Some of those doctors contacted me desperate for support, which I gave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tristar Medical Group was placed under voluntary administrator McGrathNicol Restructuring on 24 May this year. Many of the doctors in Mildura were not paid for up to 10 weeks, and $6.3 million was owed to Tristar employees across their 12 clinics. All Tristar services ceased on 19 August this year, when the sale of Tristar Mildura was unsuccessful the night before. The doors closed without warning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, the ABC reported a Fair Work Ombudsman investigation is now underway—thank goodness! The Fair Work Ombudsman is investigating Tristar for potential breaches of the Fair Work Act for the second time, after inquiries were made in 2019. The administrator's report says Tristar was likely insolvent from 2019 or earlier. The report goes on to state Tristar's records detail: $1.9 million of unpaid payroll tax; $4.4 million in unpaid superannuation; outstanding tax payments of $5.1 million; Tristar had not lodged any tax returns since 2019; some unpaid service fees owed to doctors date back to July 2020; and balance sheet accounts had not been maintained since 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical outcome here is that the sudden closure of Tristar with less than 24 hours notice has left 15,200 people in Mildura without a doctor. There is no capacity at other clinics. All clinics have already closed their books. There are 15,200 patients who cannot access scripts, test results or medical records, and there is no phone number. There are people who are unaware they have a serious diagnosis. I was at the Tristar clinic the week after it closed, and people were still turning up not knowing it had closed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Khaled El-Sheikh was a director in the company when he owed $6.3 million in wages. I've been told he has been reported to ASIC. This also is good. However, the process normally takes 12 to 18 months. I wait to hear what the FWO and ASIC find. I hear his brother is now going to run two new clinics in Mildura and Red Cliffs, with his brother Khaleed El-Sheikh practising. This plan had undoubtedly begun months ago. Dr El-Sheikh is today advertising his new practice on Facebook, calling it the Kure Clinic, which is now open, where previous Tristar doctors are joining him. This kind of business behaviour ought never to happen in Australia. However, the current dearth of doctors in regional centres means unscrupulous business practice can follow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  Ted Dickson has kept the wheels in motion at the Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum for nearly three decades. He not only helped establish the museum; he gives up more than 20 hours of his time every week to maintain and manage the important historical site. That unwavering effort has seen him named Blue Mountains Volunteer of the Year in the 2022 New South Wales Volunteer of the Year Awards. As a patron of the museum, I was especially proud to present him with his award, which he accepted with humility—and maybe a tear—in front of his peers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Zonta Club of the Blue Mountains has a terrific team of 18 volunteers, who have played a huge role in women's advocacy and support during the pandemic. They've supported seven women in their educational journeys, and they provide practical and emotional support for women in crisis accommodation. Congratulations to this relatively new club, the Blue Mountains Zonta, for their exceptional work and for being named the Blue Mountains Volunteer Team of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrea Lang was named Blue Mountains Adult Volunteer of the Year. She gives up her time to keep more than 500 RSPCA staff and volunteers up to date with information, policies and procedures to promote and protect animal welfare. I congratulate all the nominees and award winners and I thank the Centre for Volunteering for supporting and recognising our magnificent volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When a flood comes and then goes, it isn't actually over; it's often when a lot of the really hard stuff starts for the community. The Hawkesbury community has suffered through multiple floods, and we know the cumulative effects that's having on people's mental health, particularly young people. We're certainly seeing higher levels of anxiety, and the weather forecast for the rest of this year is just enhancing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Albanese government will deliver $1.1 million early to fast-track a headspace for the Hawkesbury. That means better access to mental health services for young people aged between 12 and 25—something that has been sorely needed in the Hawkesbury for so many years, and something that I've been fighting for for more than a decade. That's also why our government will deliver $4 million to make Head to Health a permanent service in the Hawkesbury. That means adults in our community will be able to get free help when they need it, close to home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Flood has followed flood and that followed fire in the Hawkesbury in the last few years, and all of it came to a head with the pandemic. The trauma of natural disasters has a significant direct and indirect impact—from homes being inundated to businesses feeling the pinch because roads are blocked and customers and supplies, ironically, dry up. I've fought for improved mental health services for our community for years, and I'm very pleased to see this government delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The arts is sometimes seen as something nice to do, but anyone who knows someone who works in this sector knows that they are driven, they're passionate and they work as hard as anybody else in any other job. As Special Envoy for the Arts, over the last few weeks I've been really privileged to do community consultations in regional areas on our new National Cultural Policy. I've listened to artists and creators from the New South Wales Central West to the Kimberley in Western Australia, from regional Victoria, in places like Bendigo, through to North Queensland and Darwin. I've also done First Nations forums for northern Queensland and northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the Minister for the Arts, I've had more than 800 people attend around 14 or 15 town hall consultations and online events, and there have been more than 1,200 written submissions. This is all to ensure that we really get a terrific National Cultural Policy by the end of this year. Typically it takes Labor governments about four years to do a national cultural policy—I'm not going to talk about how long it takes the other side to do it. We like to do it well. This time we've decided that we really need to move fast and the minister has very wisely picked up the policy we had when we were last in government that had barely six months of implementation. It's going to have five pillars, where First Nations are at the heart and the artist is recognised as a worker. We want to look at how we can extend the reach for Australian artists. I'm looking forward to working on this in coming months. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:53</span>):  I'd like to take the time to honour a man who was loved by all who had the privilege of knowing him. That man was Samuel Gunsser. He was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of man. He lived a life that impacted countless others, and those who knew him were forever changed by the impact that he left on their lives. Sam was born on 1 March 1977 and, sadly, on 14 April this year, at the age of just 44, Sam lost his 14-month battle with cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first had a sit-down meeting with Samuel Gunsser in 2019. He came to my office to see me as his federal MP. I remember being struck by his wisdom, his compassion for people and for the community, his integrity, his love for his family and the positive attitude he brought when I spoke to him. I had a lot in common with him. He was truly a humble man, Sam. He was a wonderful problem solver, but if he didn't have the answer he always knew a person who would. Despite only knowing Sam for three short years, it really felt to me that he was a friend of mine, and you don't get a lot of friends. He just had a remarkable impact on me and the other people that he met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sam is remembered by his wife of 19 years, Karolina, and their four children, Maja, Layla, Judah and Jesse. His children were his pride and joy. Yesterday was also Father's Day. At his life's celebration service in April, Sam's 13-year-old daughter had this to say of her dad: 'I've never met another person who had all the time in the world for other people yet still managed to make it home in time for dinner every night.' The fact is Sam's children know that their father loved them. It's a sign of a great father. Family was the bedrock of all Sam did, and he loved them wholly and completely. He only ever spoke in a positive way about them to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sam's wife, Karolina, has said that Sam 'helped her to become more than she could ever have imagined' and that he loved her more in 20 years than many do in a lifetime. Sam, along with Karolina, was a pastor in the Petrie electorate, on the Redcliffe peninsula. Helping her become her best and building her up was an attribute of a great husband. I remember saying to Sam, after hearing Karolina speak, that she was a wonderful speaker. He said, 'Yes, I know.' Marc Eslick, a local business owner within the Petrie electorate, said about Sam: 'He was impactful; he was intentional. He moved people individually and collectively. Sam loved God and he loved people.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sam faced many battles in his final year, but not once did I hear him complain. He would say, 'It's all good,' and he had a peace about him. Sam was a leader in the community, and he was always thinking of ways he could help others, because he saw the bigger picture. If I asked local people who knew Sam to describe him, they would truly say that he was a good man, a man who left a legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cancer is a leading cause of death by disease in adults and children in Australia. One in two Australian families will be affected. I'm sure that there isn't a family in the Petrie electorate that has not been touched in some way by the disease via a friend or family member. In 2020 my uncle Ken Bryant passed away from cancer, at the age of 68. He also was a great man. Despite being 20 years older than me, he was a groomsman at my wedding. Like Sam, he was committed to his wife, Tonya, my aunty. I remember I was a teenager when they celebrated 20 years of marriage. I said to my uncle, 'Twenty years—wow, that's a long time,' and he said, 'Luke, it's a good start.' Both men were great men. They knew where they were going. They had an inner strength because of their Christian faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition committed, if re-elected, to an investment of $375 million plus to build a state-of-the-art cancer centre in Brisbane, a place specifically designed for the early detection, treatment and prevention of this horrible disease. It would create new jobs for Queensland, provide support for families carrying the hardship of diagnosis and fund more scientific and medical research. I know the government is committed to that as well. As the member representing the people of Petrie, I know that any additional funding we can spend on scientific and medical research so that loved ones who are diagnosed with cancer have a little bit more time with their families would be welcome.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Under the cover of darkness in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic being used as an excuse, the Centrelink office in Benalla was closed. The local community were promised consultation on future services for Benalla, but that never happened. Instead, they were told a year after the closure, with just two days notice, that they would have to settle for an agency model—basically an office with a computer and a phone, with no staff who can actually make decisions on their payments. This caused major issues for people in Benalla. The closest Centrelink offices are in Wangaratta, an 80-kilometre round trip, and Shepparton, a 120-kilometre round trip. Fuel is incredibly expensive, and public transport options are unreliable and irregular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure makes no sense if you understand Benalla. The population of Benalla is significantly older than the general population and less likely to have finished year 12, and the median household income is 32.2 per cent lower than the Victorian median. Almost one in five people in Benalla are on the age pension. This all points to a community already facing significant disadvantage, with higher likelihood to have low digital literacy, to rely on government support and to have complex cases that need personalised attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I highlight the challenges Benalla faces, don't be mistaken: this is a special town. Since the Centrelink office closed, locals have rallied to make the case for it to be reopened. They've written letters to ministers and editors, made freedom of information requests and more. This is a community that gets involved and gets stuff done. People like Des Moylan, Hamish McPherson and Linda Tullberg, and many more, have stood up for community in a time of need. They've started a petition, which has been signed by more than 2,100 people, and more than 200 people have completed a survey about their experiences since the office closed. I seek leave to present this petition asking the government to reopen the Centrelink office in Benalla. </span>

                  </a>  I present the document. The current Minister for Government Services, Mr Shorten, visited Benalla during the election campaign.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  Last week in this parliament we saw a very strange sight indeed—shocking, even, to those who might have observed parliament or Australian politics for the last decade or more. We saw an Australian government led by a prime minister behaving like an adult, who brought together leaders from right across the country in the national interest. Now, this shouldn't be something to remark upon. It should be the ordinary business of government. But what we've seen after a decade of dysfunction and division from those opposite has left the country in a serious, precarious situation in terms of the economy, the budget and the big national challenges. So we saw business leaders, union leaders and experts actually listening to professors who spend their lives thinking about these things. Workers were sitting down in the same room, listening to each other and talking about the big national challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was there for the first part of the first day, and, talking to leaders from right across the country, I found that the overwhelming emotion was relief—relief that the dreadful Morrison government was gone and that there was a government that was actually interested not just in listening to them but in bringing people together in a civil way to hear different perspectives, powerful perspectives. You saw leaders of big business sitting in the room and listening to the perspectives of the vulnerable. That should be ordinary business of government, but Australia lost its way under the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The big national challenges are serious, though. We heard our economy—the budget—faces crisis. There are record levels of inflation, falling real wages for the last decade, and a skills shortage crisis exacerbated by $3 billion of cuts to TAFE, training and apprenticeships under the previous government—</span>

                  </a>  He's yelling out funny little program names. That's the problem: there was never a structural response to anything that the nation faced. There were bandaids, sticky tapes and cute little announcements. Does anyone remember JobMaker? It was going to create 450,000 jobs. It created one per cent of the target, if that—JobFaker! It was a decade of dysfunction and division, with a trillion dollars of Liberal debt that the next generation's going to be asked to repay, and a budget riddled with waste and rorts. It was a test, though, for Opposition Leader Peter Dutton. Had he heard any kind of message? Did he realise that the challenges were serious and that Australians wanted a different kind of politics? No. It's a test that the Liberals failed. He chose to hide at home, to hide in the dark, isolated and humiliated.</span>

I was delighted to see real practical outcomes at the end of the summit. There will be 180,000 new fee-free TAFE places to strengthen TAFE; income credit for aged pensioners who want to work to earn extra—$4,000 this financial year; work on housing; and restoring a national consensus in favour of permanent skilled migration that does our nation well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  Thirsty Chiefs is a small brewery in my electorate of Petrie that has been operating for seven years. It's a one-of-a-kind establishment brewing beer, cider and ginger beer, all in house, and employing local people. They host local musicians and food trucks every Friday and Saturday night, and they support the wider community in North Lakes. In fact, many community organisations have held events there—organisations like Save North Lakes Golf Course, local environmental and koala centres, and other community establishments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, Thirsty Chiefs received a letter from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water advising them of success in their application for $25,000 under the Energy Efficient Communities grants. On hearing this news, I went personally to the brewery to congratulate them on receiving the grant. I asked the owner of Thirsty Chiefs, Dean Nolan, what he would use the funding for. He told me that the $25,000 would help them replace their current seven-year-old LPG-run boiler with a more energy-efficient electric boiler. They are currently spending $15,000 a year on LPG, and they're spending 10 times the amount that households spend on energy each year. The new boiler would be run off the solar panels that are already on the roof, and the installation of this new boiler would not only decrease emissions but also increase the bottom line of the business, making it more viable to employ more staff and serve the community. This is at a time when small businesses are already struggling to keep up with the week-to-week expenses under the increased inflation of the Albanese government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only months later, after the election, what happened? They got a letter from the Albanese government saying that their grant, which was approved by the department, was under review. The Labor government went to the last election on a foundation of climate change and reducing emissions by 43 per cent by 2030—in fact, the legislation has now passed the House—so it doesn't make sense that this government would send a letter to grant recipients saying that their grant is under review and might not be funded. It's absolutely absurd. Dean has told me that he was gutted when he received the letter saying that the grants were under review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday, I made a visit to Thirsty Chiefs with the member of for Fairfax, our shadow minister for climate change and energy, Ted O'Brien. It is our intention to bring to light the other 800 businesses around Australia that, like Thirsty Chiefs, were fully approved by the department even without a local member's input—it all came down to the assessment by the department. These 800 businesses are being left in the dark, and many of them are now waiting with worn down, broken technology. They deserve answers and they deserve them now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  There is a disturbing trend across Australia. It's the closure of many of our bank branches, particularly in regional areas. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia recently announced it is closing the Drysdale branch on the Bellarine Peninsula, within my electorate. That is an especially bitter blow for the people of Drysdale, coming in the wake of the National Australia Bank closing its Drysdale branch earlier this year. The Drysdale CBA is an important branch for many in that community. There is a sizable elderly population in Drysdale, many of whom have banked with the CBA for decades. The closure will especially impact those who are less skilled at online banking or who don't even have access to online technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CBA said to the Drysdale post office that it would be the outlet to handle withdrawals and deposits on its behalf. However, there are many times when people need to go to a bank for personal assistance. Many bank transactions are more complex than simple deposits or withdrawals. For some, it's the regular contact—it's the face-to-face contact, the chat—that really matters. Local businesses in Drysdale will still need to have weekly or daily banking. To announce the branch will now become part of the Ocean Grove branch, 15 kilometres away, is not only impractical; it's insulting to the many loyal Drysdale customers. I'm also concerned not just for the elderly but for those with disability. For them, travel is not always practical or possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm told that the CBA in Drysdale closes its doors this Friday. ATMs at the branch will also close. I'm also concerned about the future of staff at these banks. It's hard to fathom why this is happening, when both the CBA and the NAB are making bumper multimillion-dollar profits, as are the other banks. Transitioning to internet banking might make sense to executives in head offices, but it is disenfranchising our most vulnerable. I believe customers deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other bank branches in my electorate are also closing. Bendigo Bank, ANZ and Westpac have permanently closed or will permanently close a number of their branches in the Geelong region. So that's six fewer branches in the region. I suspect Corangamite is not the only electorate across the nation experiencing this. I ask the banks—I urge them—to carefully reconsider their decisions about branch closures in light of the huge impacts, and I remind banks of their social licence from the community and their customers. It's disappointing that at this stage customers appear to have become, with all banks, a distant second to profits. That is far more important to the banks than the people they serve. They need to get their act together.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I'm delighted—absolutely tickled pink—to be standing in the Chamber today talking about the future of New Acland Mine with a smile on my face. It's fantastic news. You see, one week ago the state Labor government finally bowed to reason and granted the necessary mining approvals for New Acland's stage 3 expansion to go ahead, a fantastic result. It's brilliant to see miners being transitioned back into their jobs in the seat of Groom. Now, there's one caveat: we do still need to wait for the associated water licence to come through. But, given that this mine has met every test that's been put to it over a prolonged period, over 15 years, I'm absolutely confident that New Hope Group's predictions that this mine will be back up and running at the start of next year will come through. That 15-year battle we saw cost hundreds of local workers their jobs as redundancies ran out through the workforce there. So it's fantastic to finally have a pathway of hope in front of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was doorknocking through Oakey, the message was loud and clear: 'Great news. Where do I sign up?' People want jobs and people tell the stories of how New Hope has supported the local community and done so much. They're a great community asset. It's a feeling shared on the high street. I caught up with a great country pie shop owner, Vicki Reeves—I bought a wonderful cottage pie from Vicki's pie shop, the best in Groom— and we were talking about just how important it is for the mine to be coming back to life. We've got a wonderful Army base out there and we've got meatworks out there, but the mine has been essential to Oakey and to Acland for so long. It's absolutely brilliant to have it back. Hers is just one of many businesses in Groom that will receive a much-needed boost from this project going ahead. It's estimated that New Acland will generate $1 billion for our local economy over the next 10 to 15 years. That's around 10 per cent of our gross regional product. This is a huge investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just about the businesses. Let's talk about the workers: workers who live in Oakey, in Goombungee, in Highfields; workers who will enrol their kids in the local schools and sporting clubs; workers who will put a little bit of money back into their farms or their mortgages. According to New Hope Group, there will be 400 long-term jobs on the mine, and 600 short term in the ramp-up. This is fantastic. And, while, rightly, we'll be aiming to bring back the people who lost their jobs through those redundancies, there are still going to be hundreds of new jobs out there for other people. So this is not just great news for Oakey; this is great news for Queensland and Australia. If you want a job in the coalmining industry, come to Oakey. There are fantastic opportunities waiting there for you. There's no better place to live, work and raise a family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the start of a whole new decade of investment for Oakey. It's a town that's had a really tough last couple of years, with the redundancies, with PFAS issues. But here we are now with a great announcement. We're so close. I call on the Queensland government to commit to their decision, grant the water licences and let Oakey get back to business. </span>

The adoption of electric vehicles in Australia will be akin to switching from analog to smart phones. It will be a step change in transport that will liberate us from the irritations of the nozzle. But that's not all. We can look forward to breathing cleaner air, free from particulates and carcinogens that come from Australian cars burning some of the cheapest but dirtiest fuel in the world. Australia is only one of six countries in the OECD to not have vehicle emissions standards. For example, our unleaded petrol has 15 times the level of sulphur in similar fuel in Europe. As a result, we have been denied the most fuel efficient and environmentally friendly cars by European car makers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous, coalition government established a ministerial forum on vehicle emissions in 2015. And what did it deliver? Nothing. As a result, Australians fell further behind in the electric vehicle race and are now in the pincer grip of high fuel prices and cost-of-living pressures. The lack of policy certainty has meant that, while consumers in the UK have access to 26 low-emissions vehicles under $60,000, in Australia we have access to only eight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is determined to change all of this. In the way that we have a world of choice at our fingertips, we want to give Australians a world of choice when it comes to electric vehicles. At present, getting these cars is like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hunger Games</span>. Meagre offerings are selling out in minutes, much like grand-final tickets. However, the EV roadshow is getting underway, and tickets are selling fast. We have acted to make EVs cheaper by removing the five per cent import tariff for cars below the luxury tax threshold. The removal of fringe benefits tax will make electric vehicles more attractive to employers by shaving $12,000 off the cost of a Tesla Model 3, for example. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also committed $500 million to establishing a national EV charging network with charge points every 150 kilometres. In Higgins, we have seven public EV charge points. It's an embarrassment, but it's going to change. We will create a national hydrogen-fuelling network, and flip the Commonwealth fleet, aiming for 75 per cent low-emission vehicles on new leases by 2025. This will have the ancillary benefit of boosting the second-hand car market once these leases expire. Improving our fuel standards is also on our radar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely conceivable that the young Aussie kids of today will learn to drive on EVs—lucky them. But it's the commitments that we make today, not luck, that will make this a reality. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  On 23 August this year I hosted the Hasluck green energy jobs and skills roundtable in Perth in order to help inform the Jobs and Skills Summit and the government's white paper process. Around our crowded table were industry representatives, union leaders, heads of training organisations and delegates from state ministries and departments. I was ably assisted by Brad Weir from IMS Consulting as facilitator, and I was impressed by the candour of the participants and by the breadth and depth of experience in the room. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard constructive ideas from all present, including Rio Tinto, Woodside, Province Resources, METS Ignited, Penske Australia, Synergy, Horizon Power, Future Battery Industries CRC, JET Charge, Hofmann Engineering, Intercontinental Energy, NHOA Energy, Thales New Energy, Connect Source, Adarsh Australia, the CFMEU, the AWU, North Metro TAFE, and the state ministers of education, training, tourism, science, innovation, mines, petroleum and energy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The roundtable, which focused on opportunities and challenges in the renewables sector, identified many areas for further consideration, including setting additional interim targets to net zero at state and federal level; setting both domestic and export targets for the production and manufacture of renewables; reservation of a supply guarantee for essential minerals; review of government investment risk parameters; guaranteeing government procurement at useful levels across all departments; and providing long-term government contracts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We discussed the need for frameworks for more livable communities in the regions where the new industries will flourish; improving the alignment of VET and university courses with workforce planning data; nationwide licensing standards and competency tests; modular training and more work placement programs for students; retention risk measures for firms taking on apprentices; improving apprentice pay and conditions; and reviewing the visa system to allow easy access to skilled migrants for businesses that have a healthy apprentice program in place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all participants in the Hasluck roundtable and hope to carry on this work with them in the future. In the end, what do industry really need from government? Sometimes they do need support and in a timely manner, but what they need at all times is consistency and leadership. They need clear intent. They need overarching goals and targets that are set, stuck to, regularly reviewed and, if possible, improved over time. Our government has already started this work, at the Jobs and Skills Summit, with leadership and goal setting, allowing for periodic review, heeding recommendations and, all the time, being receptive to innovative ideas and solutions. There is another word for this. It's called governing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  A bull rider I ain't, and anybody who saw the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders </span>yesterday would have noted, with some humour and mirth, the fact that I couldn't stay on one of those electronic bulls for longer than a mere few seconds. But I raise this point because the bull riding was in vogue at the Parkes show, and the shows are back in town. It's so good, when you go across the countryside, across regional Australia, to see the agricultural shows back in force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I visited the Trundle show. What a fantastic event that was. They had dog trials and dog jumping. It was so good to see people getting out and about once more, enjoying the shows for what they are. There were poultry exhibitions. There were schoolchildren doing their best colouring-in and winning, potentially, certificates and the like. There was cooking. Flo's pumpkin scones have got nothing on some of the show exhibits that people go to so much trouble to bake and make! Indeed, it is good just to be getting together after two years of COVID, when our country shows weren't able to be held. Pleasingly, in that time the former government put together a package of $52.9 million to support shows, and many of our country shows put in place the infrastructure that is going to benefit their show communities for decades to come. This is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited the Parkes show. I visited the Ganmain show. These country shows are what make some of these little towns—and not-so-little towns; we've got the Wagga Wagga show coming up—really vibrant and happening places. I mentioned the grants and the infrastructure. Lockhart received $75,360 to upgrade their livestock sheds and construct a ticketing booth. Those ticketing booths are staffed by people who have, in some cases, been there for decades. It's their place in that community. They turn up, they sell the tickets, they hand out the tickets, they man the gates, and it's so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Ardlethan they refurbished their kitchen with a $46,000 grant. Bedgerabong had $70,000 to upgrade their watering system. Cowra had $67,000 for new air conditioning and solar panels. Illabo had $118,000 to upgrade their pavilion kitchen. All of these things have made these little community shows what they're going to be in the future, and they're loving it. I look forward to going back to Parkes and, hopefully, staying on the electronic bull for longer than three or four seconds, and I look forward to getting to as many shows as I can.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  Last week the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs made an important announcement: the Albanese Labor government will invest $36.1 million into visa processing to clear the backlog, to decrease waiting times and to welcome more people who decide to call Australia home. This investment will surge staff capacity by 500 people over the next nine months to address the crisis crippling our visa system. When the Albanese government was elected in May, nearly a million visa applications were awaiting processing. The previous government, the Liberal government, cut resourcing, drove department culture into the ground and intentionally slowed down processing times. They knew that, the harder and longer they made the process, the longer people would be living in limbo and uncertainty away from their loved ones. The longer businesses and workers couldn't make decisions, the more likely people would be to give up. What has this gotten us? We have a visa-processing system in crisis. We are facing critical skills shortages and lagging in the competition to attract talent, and we have a reputation unbefitting a proud multicultural nation built off the back of generations of migration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already addressing this issue. In the short time we've been in government, we have already cleared 100,000 applications. Last week the Minister for Home Affairs announced an increase of approximately 35,000 additional permanent skilled migrants, lifting the annual cap to 195,000 places. This means more skilled migrants to help fill worker shortages in critical areas like nurses, engineers and tech experts. Wait times are also down. Instead of being 53 days on average, the wait time for a skilled migrant is down to 42 days. Instead of 37 days for new businesses for sponsorship, it's now 18 days, less than half the time under the former government. Student wait times are down from 40 days to 31 days. And more than 50 per cent of working holiday visa applications are now finalised within a single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean for Australia? It means that businesses can have certainty and can fill areas of skills shortages quickly. It means that families, some of which have been separated for many years because of the pandemic, can be reunited sooner. It means a boost to our economy, as migration has proven time and time again to create more jobs and investments that benefit all Australians. And it means that we can reclaim the true spirit of the Australian story, as a country that has welcomed people from across the seas, like my parents, who migrated from Egypt and worked hard every day not only to give their children—me and my sister—a better life but to give back to the country that gave them so much. They settled here as permanent migrants, as Australians, as new Australians. This story is common across the country. In my electorate of Wills, communities, whether they be generations of Italians and Greeks or Vietnamese, Lebanese, Iraqi, Indian or Pakistani—people from so many countries around the world—have come here to make a new home. We all know someone who was given the opportunity to call Australia home. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Last Monday, 29 August, my beautiful wife, Yolonde, and I had the pleasure of attending the 2022 Hostplus North Queensland and Northern Territory restaurant and caterers awards. This is the first time for a couple of years that the awards have been held. There was a little thing that crept into our society, called COVID, that had caused some delays. It was a fabulous evening, with plenty of fierce competition across 27 categories, and there were 98 nominees. I'd like to take the opportunity, first of all, of congratulating all of the winners in their specialist categories, from Darwin, Port Douglas, Cairns, Palm Cove and Townsville. I would like, in the Chamber, to make special mention of Chris Buckley from Chriso the Personal Chef and of CC's Bar and Grill, because both of those businesses took out multiple awards. I would also like to make special mention of Craig Squire of Ochre for taking out the lifetime achievement award, something that, of course, I wasn't particularly surprised by, given his contribution to that industry. So congratulations to all the award winners and to all the nominees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity to speak to many people that evening. While the industry had very appropriate government assistance during COVID, with the measures we put in place to insulate them from the disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, there's still a lot more that we need to do. Staffing has been a significant challenge in the industry. Some consideration needs to be given to the visa arrangements for hospitality workers. It's clear that this and other measures, such as increasing the hours of work that retired people can undertake before their Services Australia payments are impacted, would be very much welcomed. I also welcomed the focus on that at the last jobs summit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of sitting with the association's CEO, Belinda Clarke, to celebrate the achievements of the industry. The association represents 55,000 venues and 350,000 jobs. There are currently 122 jobs on offer online. It's disturbing to know that, despite this massive contribution, they were not offered a seat at the recent jobs summit. It's hard to believe that, given the significance of their contribution, this was just an oversight. It worries me that it may well have been a government putting politics before common sense and that this was another way of punishing the association for their support of WorkChoices all those many years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>I understand that the Hotels Association was also omitted from the invitation. Fortunately, at the last moment, they did get an invitation, but the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association missed out. I hope that my concerns are proven wrong. I'd again like to thank the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association and Hostplus for putting on a great event.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299498" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I rise to support the member for Riverina's motion regarding foot-and-mouth disease, a disease that has been spreading throughout Indonesia, including the holiday destination of Bali. Roughly half of Australia's cattle population lives in Queensland, and roughly one-third of that lives in Central Queensland, which includes my electorate of Flynn. Many graziers have contacted me concerned about what a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak would mean to their businesses and, more significantly, to Australia in general. If foot-and-mouth disease reaches Australian shores, it will devastate the agricultural industry and associated industries and cost the Australian economy tens of billions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2001, in the United Kingdom, foot-and-mouth disease forced the destruction of more than six million pigs, cows and sheep at an estimated cost of eight billion pounds. Australia's agricultural industry is worth much more than the United Kingdom's, with our beef industry being worth more than $20 billion alone. A new report commissioned by Regional Development Australia Central and Western Queensland has predicted catastrophic economic consequences if an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease were to occur. This disease would inflict a $1.1 billion hit to the Central Queensland and western Queensland economies and cause almost 34,000 job losses. The RDA report shows that western Queensland and the banana regions account for more of Australia's cattle herd than any other regions and would suffer gross regional product losses of 37.3 per cent and 10.1 per cent, respectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the Labor government simply does not get it. In the short time since coming to office, Labor has a biosecurity crisis on its hands. The Labor government's response to FMD has been marred by indecision, uncertainty and embarrassing backflips. Since the FMD outbreak in Bali, the federal government has been slow to react. Labor's approach to an $80 billion risk to the Australian economy is dangerously indecisive at a time when Australian farmers are crying out for tough measures. A prime example is that Labor took over four weeks to put foot mats at airports, allowing tens of thousands of people to waltz through our borders from Indonesia despite our calls. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor state Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia has been saying that an outbreak of FMD in Australia would result in cheaper meat and milk. These comments from a state Labor minister about a disease that threatens tens of thousands of livelihoods are appalling and offensive. Agriculture ministers have a serious job. They are meant to understand the industry and then support and promote it. This minister has shown that she is incapable of this. It demonstrates yet again that the Labor Party does not understand the needs and concerns of the agricultural sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our agricultural industry needs to be protected against biosecurity threats such as foot-and-mouth disease, and this requires leadership. On 22 July New Zealand introduced a ban on travellers from Indonesia bringing in animal and meat products. If this measure was good enough for New Zealand, why not Australia? Every single arrival from Indonesia needs to be screened. This does not matter whether arrivals have visited cities or rural areas in Indonesia. The foot-and-mouth disease threat is too great.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, the coalition has been calling for this Labor government to immediately offer 3D X-ray technology to Indonesia to help combat the threat of the disease at their airports. This state-of-the-art technology works, and the Labor government must urgently move to establish a similar screening program with Indonesia. Labor must act swiftly and work constructively with Indonesia to get this technology operating for incoming luggage. If we are to have the technology, why not use it? Offering 3D X-ray technology to Indonesian airports and banning travellers from carrying food products from Indonesia are all necessary, particularly when the federal government's one million vaccines for Indonesia have only just arrived, a shameful seven weeks after they were promised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to explore the possibility of temporarily suspending all but essential travel to Indonesia, including Bali. The same protocol was implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19. Industry groups are calling for border closures because they are not convinced the Labor government has a plan to adequately manage this major issue. To restore public confidence in the management of this, the Labor government must explain why border closures will not be considered and why existing measures are adequate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  We can all appreciate the seriousness of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia and the devastating impact FMD would have on Australia's livestock industry. Thankfully, there is no evidence that FMD is currently in Australia. As my colleagues made mention of the last time this motion was debated, we certainly plan on that remaining the case. Without the continued vigilance of this government, FMD poses a massive risk to Australia's livestock industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia has a thriving livestock industry—including, I'm proud to say, in parts of my electorate of Hasluck. The WA meat and livestock industry runs into billions of dollars of domestic and exported product. We are a world leader in meat exports of high-quality beef, sheep and pork, as well as in superfine wool production. In Hasluck we are very much alive to the importance of vigilance when it comes to biosecurity. The Swan Valley and the Perth Hills both run through my electorate, and produce world-class wine, cheeses, table grapes, stone fruit, apples and much more. The threat of pest and disease is ever present. The prosperity of the region and the massive contribution it makes to our economy is reliant on everyone, including this government, doing the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I met Graeme Yukich at Oakover Wines in the Swan Valley. He is not only growing vines for wine production but also distributing around 250 different types of cheese to retailers around WA. He is relying on the measures that this government is taking to protect the dairy industry in Australia. Just outside my electorate, in York, my sister and her husband run a flock of sheep. They, too, are relying on the action that our government has taken to protect our industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know all too well the potential dangers FMD presents. This is why I'm happy to talk about the action our government is taking to ensure the safety and success of industry here in Australia. The measures begin with providing support to Indonesia to combat the outbreak. Indonesia and, specifically, Bali are a short flight away from Perth Airport, and few people love heading over to Bali for a bit of R&amp;R more than us sandgropers. The Australian government has committed $14 million in immediate funding to manage the increased threat of foot-and-mouth disease and lumpy skin disease, in addition to $1½ million to supply vaccines to Indonesia and $550,000 to support the industry led assistance made available by Meat &amp; Livestock Australia. This is in addition to providing biosecurity officers, granted extra powers under the Biosecurity Act 2015 to direct returning travellers to use the sanitising foot mats in Australian airports; increased education resources such as fliers, airport announcements and online advertising to ensure travellers are made aware of their responsibilities; and biosecurity detector dogs in Darwin and Cairns airports, risk-profiling 100 per cent of passengers that come into Australia from Indonesia. By providing this expert technical advice, vaccines and financial support to Indonesia, we can significantly minimise the risk of introducing FMD while maintaining positive bilateral relations with our important, close neighbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will continue to listen to the experts and work with industry to make sure we have the best possible calibration of our response to this very serious situation. It cannot be overstated just how seriously this government is taking this issue. We are led in this area by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Murray Watt, and his record of swift action speaks for itself and has kept Australia free from FMD. I am sure the minister welcomes any constructive advice that this parliament or the public have on this issue. It's right to raise the valid concerns of people directly engaged in the livestock industry, without becoming unduly alarmist or playing politics with what is a very serious matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns have been properly raised about the effect that populations of feral animals such as pigs might have on the spread of FMD if it got a foothold. The need to address feral animals has been covered by the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report and is a matter this government takes very seriously. In the midst of our valid concerns about industry, I would like to add that we should spare a thought for the animals themselves. I know firsthand that for many farmers this is the most immediate and distressing part of having to deal disaster, whether it be disease, flood, fire or other. People who work with animals never want to see those animals suffer. We should also recognise and thank the overwhelming majority of travellers who are doing the right thing, taking their responsibilities seriously and playing their role to keep FMD out of Australia. It is greatly appreciated by the government, by farmers and by everyone who relies on crucial agricultural and livestock industries. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249764" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion. In the nine short weeks since it came to office, the Labor Party has had a biosecurity crisis on its hands, with a potential outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease—a crisis of its own doing, due to inaction and ineffective decision-making. Regional and rural electorates like Capricornia will be on the frontlines of a potential outbreak. An outbreak would be devastating to the Central Queensland economy and Australia's $80 billion livestock industry. But don't just take my word for it. Regional Development Australia Central and Western Queensland commissioned a report titled the <span style="font-style:italic;">Economic </span><span style="font-style:italic;">significance of the livestock industry to Central and Western Queensland</span>. It painted a dire picture of what could happen to the region should an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occur. I want to congratulate RDA Central and Western Queensland for taking the proactive step of releasing this report. This report states that an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease will cost the region $1.1 billion, which is 5.2 per cent of the region's economy. In my electorate, $214.4 million would be written off Rockhampton's economy, and $121.8 million would be written off Livingstone Shire. Jobs would also be at risk. If an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occurs, approximately 7,034 jobs in Rockhampton and 3,960 jobs in the Livingstone Shire would be lost. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beef is important to Capricornia. Rockhampton is known worldwide as the beef capital of Australia. Rockhampton hosts Beef Australia expos every three years, and people from all over Australia and the world come to Rockhampton to see the quality of Australian beef and discuss cutting-edge agriculture practices. Beef 2021 was a record year, with a total attendance of 115,886 people, an increase of 15 per cent from the 2018 event, with the average person visiting the event for 2.81 days. The coalition government proudly supported the event with a contribution of $3.9 million. All that progress would be at risk, and we simply cannot afford this potential hit to our local economies and to our local jobs. I remember seeing the images from the United Kingdom in 2001 of the carcasses of cows and sheep piled high, with flames engulfing them. Over six million sheep and cattle were destroyed to contain the spread. I genuinely fear we could see the same here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we now have an agriculture minister from the Gold Coast who fundamentally does not understand what foot-and-mouth disease can do to electorates like the one I represent. I have previously called on the Prime Minister to take direct control of biosecurity measures after Minister Watt's failures on containing foot-and-mouth disease and his slow response in rolling out measures to prevent the spread. Senator Watt was more than happy to throw criticisms around when he was a humble senator in opposition, but it seems he has proven to have a glass jaw when rightful criticism is levelled his way. I have sympathy for the minister. Being in government is serious, and people's lives depend on your decisions. I understand he might not be used to the responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to recent foot-and-mouth disease detections in Melbourne and Adelaide, Labor has made an embarrassing backdown to finally introduce sanitised foot mats at international airports. This is a move that is weeks overdue and an important measure that the federal coalition has been calling for since FMD was first detected. Labor's dithering and delay in implementing this simple but important measure is unfortunate. In recent weeks, tens of thousands of people have come into Australia from Indonesia without having to disinfect their shoes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are failing this basic—but serious—test on biosecurity, and it's time for them to toughen up and take control of this crisis on our borders. Unlike those opposite, the Liberal National Party understands the risk of foot-and-mouth disease because we live in the communities where an outbreak would damage them severely. We call on the government to immediately ban passengers bringing any food products into Australia, and we also call for the installation of 3D X-ray machines at major international airports and for offering one to Indonesia. We also call for the bringing forward of $20 million in funding for a traceability program for ear tags and the bringing forward of $10 million in funding for the national livestock gene bank. It is our view that consideration needs to be given to stronger measures, including introducing border controls that restrict travel from Indonesia. The opposition will continue to be constructive on this developing situation, but, at this new juncture, there are biosecurity and border questions that need to be answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian farmers need to be confident that our borders are secure against the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, and their patience is wearing thin. This disease would be catastrophic for our farmers, for the Australian economy and for the everyday cost of food. No stone should be left unturned, and no option left off the table in protecting Australia from foot-and-mouth disease.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I knew that the LNP members federally were out of touch, but I didn't realise they didn't understand how the calendar worked as well. The truth of the matter is that April actually exists in the calendar before 21 May, and the reality is that foot-and-mouth disease was detected during the time of the Morrison coalition government. So they're prognosticating and preaching to us today about an issue that happened on their watch, when, in fact, they did nothing about it and biosecurity was let down in this country under the coalition government. We know that Indonesia had been free of foot-and-mouth-disease since 1986—a point that was made to me when I was in Indonesia a few short years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Organisation for Animal Health reported that the first suspected outbreaks of FMD took place in Indonesia's second-largest city, under the coalition government's time in office on 28 April 2022, and further cases were detected on 1 and 3 May 2022. So, if this was a problem, why wasn't the coalition government acting in terms of biosecurity protection in this country when they were last in office? It has spread like wildfire, it is true, in Indonesia, and by June the Indonesian government launched the nationwide vaccination rollout. Nearly one million livestock had been vaccinated, 7,700 animals had been slaughtered and nearly 5,000 had died. It's a very, very important issue, and it affects my electorate and electorates around the country—particularly my electorate where there's a very large beef cattle industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous coalition government should have had this on its radar, and I find it curious that those opposite criticise us about alleged indecision concerning disinfectant foot baths at international airports, when they did nothing about the issue when they were last in. If there were any concern about biosecurity measures, you would have thought that the previous minister for agriculture and the coalition government would have been on the front foot on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government—the Albanese Labor government—is doing things: the use of sanitised foot mats and shoe cleaning for all incoming flights from Indonesia, including Bali; additional questioning by border officials; biosecurity detector dogs in Darwin and Cairns; additional signage; social media; and training additional staff. I want to acknowledge the work done by Meat &amp; Livestock Australia for its support in making funding available for vaccine projects to support importers to vaccinate Australian cattle entering Indonesian feedlots, and we know how important Indonesian feedlots are—to feed them and the live cattle exports as well from this country. I acknowledge the work of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This is a very, very important issue in my electorate. Agriculture is important in rural Ipswich and the Somerset Region. The ABS data reported in 2021 that the local government areas of Ipswich and the Somerset produce over $166.6 million worth of agricultural commodities. Of that, livestock slaughter equates to $95.4 million. My electorate of Blair is home to the two largest meat processors in the country: JBS at Dinmore and Kilcoy Global Foods in Kilcoy. In fact, JBS played an important role in the Blair jobs summit I held on 10 August this year. It employs nearly 1,400 people and, at capacity, can employ nearly 2,200 people. There's an issue in relation to certification and health in the Chinese market as well. This is the largest private employer in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP members and senators have done what they can to politicise this issue. This motion gives the impression that everything happened chronologically on our watch, when it started under their watch. They're very quick to blame Labor for any cracks in biosecurity issues, including walls, when they were responsible, of course, until 21 May this year. I find this whole motion curious, because those opposite loudly called for borders with Indonesia to be closed when the same members cried, when borders were being closed interstate in relation to COVID, that we should open borders. The member for Nanango, who has talked about this in my local newspapers, was vocal on multiple occasions, calling on the Annastacia Palaszczuk government to open borders, but now they're talking about closing borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are suffering from 'foot-in-mouth disease' in relation to this issue. They're playing politics. I call on those opposite to work collaboratively with the federal Labor government and the Palaszczuk state government as well in relation to these issues. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I rise to support the motion. I do find it interesting that the member for Blair seems to think this is an issue that is over—that this is something that happened—and I think that probably explains a lot of what we're seeing, quite frankly. But, since we were last in this place, to be frank, the uproar around Australia's response to foot-and-mouth disease has died down. While it may no longer be dominating news headlines, the threat of this disease remains front of mind for regional communities like mine. Groom has a couple of hundred thousand head of cattle on feed sitting in it. This a concern that is not new to us. This is something that we've been watching for a long time. Although it hit the news headlines quite prominently, this is something that we have to plan for and to watch and prepare for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll continue to watch intently the spread in Indonesia and the actions of our respective governments. We do this because the impact of foot-and-mouth disease simply cannot be understated. An $80 billion meat industry is on the line, along with every locally owned business that supplies the industry. In my electorate, that includes trucking companies, vets, lawyers, accountants, mechanics and so many more. Agriculture still underpins so much of Groom's local economy. I was lucky enough to open the sales at Dorroughby Speckle Park a couple of weeks ago, and it was fantastic. This is the second sale they've had of the Speckle Park breed—a relatively new breed. There's a build of enthusiasm among people coming into the sales. But, amongst all that optimism, there's a cloud on the horizon that everyone's aware of.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease here would prevent trade for at least a few years in a best case scenario, according to department officials, and could require the mass slaughter of animals as we saw in the UK in 2001, when more than six million animals were lost, at a cost of $13 billion to the economy. In addition to the animals' suffering, imagine the mental health impact of such an exercise here in Australia. Again, I reflect upon the millennium drought. I was working at the Northparkes mine at the time. I remember speaking with local farmers in the area about the very real prospect they faced of having to shoot their stock. This is something that takes a heavy toll on people. This isn't something that is thoughtless or mindless at all. I'm not saying this to cause alarm or panic but rather to keep the reality of the situation in mind as we decide our strategy going forward and as we work to keep the general public on side and compliant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's vital that the government does not let its guard down or take its foot off the pedal in this rollout of vaccinations and biosecurity measures. I do acknowledge the arrival in Indonesia last week of the first shipment of one million FMD doses, supplied by the Australian government. It's an important step and one that I'm very, very glad to see taken, but the reality is that the heightened threat on our doorstep could be with us for a very long time. There are countries where FMD has become endemic. Our assistance to Indonesia and our home-soil protocols must be maintained for as long as necessary, but there is still scope for our response to be improved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would call on the Labor government to continue to seek new solutions to this issue and to remain open to this conversation. For example, while the department of agriculture has rolled out awareness campaigns to Australia's livestock producers, agricultural industry, travellers and a range of other stakeholders, I would argue that greater education is still needed in metro areas before people even step foot on a plane. From the concerned letters, phone calls and visits that I've had, I'm quite sure the agricultural industry and regional residents are well aware of what's at stake here and why compliance with biosecurity measures is so vital. However, I'm not confident that those who don't interact with this sector regularly are so well versed, and this isn't a city versus country matter; it's essential that everyone is educated and can work together for the protection of our nation. From the comments I've seen, including from the WA state minister for agriculture, I'm concerned that the seriousness of the situation was not clear. It may be out of the press, but this is still very much in the minds of residents in my area. The message is simple—very simple: the price of food will skyrocket. People in the suburbs and the bush are already feeling intense cost-of-living pressures. I'm sure they'll understand the seriousness of prices pushing higher. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to revisit the conversation around 3D X-ray screening of luggage entering Australia and the need to establish a program with Indonesia. We're doing this, and it's good, and we support the move to do this for mail from high-risk areas. It's a very simple question: why not do this with suitcases as well? Again, this is not the voice of panic. This is a sensible proposition, and we would ask the government to consider it. It is very important. We have gone 130 years in Australia without foot-and-mouth disease. That's not been an easy task. It's not going to be an easy task to keep us that way, but it's a task that we absolutely must stand up to. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  Again, this is classic of the Liberals and Nationals, claiming that they're the only political parties that represent regional electorates. I represent the electorate of Bendigo, which has significant livestock. Like the member for Blair's electorate, we have meat processing. Hardwicks, in my electorate, processes sheep and cattle. I also have significant cattle farms, piggeries and sheep farms in my electorate. The reason why I flag that is that this isn't a new issue. It's newish to Indonesia, but my farmers were first raising concern about this at least five or six years ago, and any member of parliament from a regional area who does their job would have been hearing the same concerns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foot-and-mouth disease was still a problem in Europe, and was Australia ready? The reason that is relevant is that it goes to the true character of those opposite and what they actually did when they were in government to prepare Australia, to prepare our borders and to prepare ourselves if there was a significant outbreak in one of the countries in our region. The fact that they can stand in here and move a motion like this, criticising us for picking up where they left a massive mess, cleaning it up and getting an action plan rolling within days of being elected is just extraordinary. It screams politics. That's all they are. If they were genuine representatives and if they were genuine about their legacy, they would have come in here saying, 'We got ourselves ready in government; now it's the new government and they're rolling out the job.' The fact is that we were left short, and it was a Labor government—and, thankfully, a Labor government was elected in May—that could be here to roll out the plan that we are now seeing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foot-and-mouth disease devastates livestock industries and it devastates throughout the supply chain, whether it be the farmers or the food processors or the retailers. If this disease were to hit Australian shores, it would be a problem. But, again, demonstrating the rhetoric of those opposite, they went straight to closing the border with Bali and banning tourists travelling there and banning people from Bali entering Australia. They were not listening to the science and not listening to the facts. The fact is that the majority of the disease that has entered Australia has entered through animal products from overseas being brought into Australia. That's the reality. It's not coming in on people's feet; it's coming in through the food. And there we have to look at what the previous government did in terms of our borders. They cut funding to the testing of products coming into this country. That's what they did. They focused so much elsewhere that they actually stopped food and other products from being imported. They actually reduced Border Force's budget in this critical area. They prioritised and put it somewhere else. So our government inherited a legacy problem. But, rather than scream about it, like those opposite are, we got straight into doing the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response that we have seen from the minister for agriculture and from the Labor government has been phenomenal. They've introduced the toughest measures we've seen when it comes to this disease and other diseases of this nature. The minister should be congratulated for the way in which we have worked with industry, with farmers and with Indonesia, where the real threat is right now. It didn't happen under the previous government; it is happening under this government. And the relief that farmers in my electorate have—this is their life; this is their industry. They're not the big graziers that we see in Queensland, but they are significant. They produce a lot of Angus cattle. They produce a lot of merino wool. But, again, whether this disease is getting into our sheep for meat production or for wool production, if sheep were to be infected with this disease, they'd have to be destroyed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to see the opposition become more bipartisan on this issue and listen to their constituencies and listen to the stakeholders who are working with the government in getting on top of this disease. This is not the time to be playing politics. This is the time for us to work together. Yes, the mats are being rolled out. Yes, the vaccinations are being rolled out. Yes, we're getting on with the job. It's not a time for politics. It's actually a time to work together as a country to make sure that this disease does not enter Australia, and, where it does, that we're getting onto it quickly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it was a big one and it needed to be. The Fair Work Commission's most recent decision delivered a 5.2 per cent rise to minimum wage workers, which is slightly above inflation. But, depending on what the inflation figures are when we next see the accounts, it will be below inflation. It works out to be about $40 a week for a full-time worker on minimum wage and for those on low-pay awards. In some other industries, it's slightly less, depending upon where they actually sit. It works out to be about an extra dollar an hour—that's what we're talking about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's relief for a lot of these hardworking people. They're in industries like cleaning; they're in industries like security. They're the people who quite often are the hidden workforce that we have in these places. They include the cleaners and the hospitality workers of this place—people who do a tough job, who are proud of their job but are locked into the minimum wage. So this announcement by Fair Work is relief for so many working people. It helps them get by. It helps them pay their bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just because our government supported the increase and called for it. The Fair Work Commission recognised that, because of the cost of living, a substantial increase was needed. High and rising inflation and weakening wages growth are reducing people's real wages. We do talk about that a lot. It's something that the other side seems to miss—if real wages don't keep up with the cost of living, people fall behind. They have less in their pay packet to be able to spend on what they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is only the beginning. Our government, in our own submission to Fair Work, said that an immediate wage increase was needed and that we backed the call that it needed to be at least at the rate of inflation so that people didn't fall behind. But what we've also done, and what came out of the Jobs and Skills Summit that happened last week, is we've brought industry and business leaders together in a room with unions to say we have to do this better. Far too many workers are stuck on the award minimum, and I reiterate: it should be a minimum and not a ceiling. Productivity has also declined. The way in which we get productivity moving, which is what industry wants to see, and the way we get wages moving is by creating a bargaining framework that works, giving more people the opportunity to bargain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is really exciting to see, coming out of the jobs summit, industry and unions and government working together. For the first time in over a decade, there's not one outside being the enemy or being ridiculed or dragged to a royal commission. Everybody is working together, because we have to get real wages moving and we have to get productivity moving. That is what is going to help our economy get back on track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These people who are trying to survive on the minimum wage are doing it tough at a time when the costs of the basics are going up. It's not just electricity prices or fuel prices going up; your average grocery items are going up. The price of broccoli, at its peak, was $13 or $14. Lettuce was up around the same. The prices of the bare essentials that people need to survive are going up. The cost of child care, if people have their children in child care, is going up. These are all legacy issues, some of which we've inherited from the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A real wage increase will help people get by. It's about giving working people the dignity of being able to work one job, not multiple jobs, to make ends meet. It's about ensuring that people earn enough. When we think back to when the minimum wage was first introduced, it was introduced through the Harvester dispute way back when, in the Sunshine Harvester Works, with its legacies throughout Victoria. Basically, the judge back then decided that the main income earner should be able to live with their family frugally and afford to cover the costs of accommodation, food and other basics but also afford a holiday. Well, if you talk to a minimum-wage worker right now, you will find that they don't get that. They are struggling. They're struggling to survive.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This wage increase of 5.2 per cent is a relief. It's an extra $1 an hour. But it's not enough to really help people struggling with the costs of living. So I congratulate the government on what they've done and strongly encourage all those speaking to remember that our low-paid workers right now need our support so that they've got the means to live their best life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  This is a confusing motion. It probably needs to be updated. I note that notice was given on 26 July. In its first line, the motion says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, inflation is at 6.1 per cent. The June quarter's annualised inflation figure was 6.1 per cent. So someone got a little bit overexcited and thought they would be moving a motion to celebrate the achievement of growing real wages for those on the minimum wage. Patently, that's not what is occurring. If inflation is higher than the increase that is being put in place then the real wages of the lowest paid in our society, those on the minimum wage, are actually decreasing. That's simple macroeconomics that I don't think can be disputed. I note that notice of the motion was given on 26 July. It was actually the next day—would you believe it?—that the updated figures were released. Maybe hanging back just one day to check that you were right about that before moving this could have saved the embarrassment. We now have a situation where the mover's not choosing to move an amendment to the motion to make it accurate. Nonetheless, it's not my motion, so that's not my problem. I simply start by pointing out that it is a simple reality that with inflation running at 6.1 per cent in the June quarter—and, unfortunately, the signs are, and the Reserve Bank are indicating that they think, that inflation will potentially be climbing into the 7s—5.2 per cent will not result in a real increase for those earning the minimum wage.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it's good if that's their position, but they're not achieving it. Australian workers on the minimum wage are going backwards, for exactly the same reason—that inflation is running higher than the increase that was achieved. hat's regrettable and it makes the motion inaccurate, unfortunately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, I don't think there's a debate about the importance of growing real wages. Of course that's what we want to see. We want to see an economy that's growing, and we want to see the growth of that economy shared very much between labour and capital. That's the most important social compact that we have got in our economy: that we all see the benefit and a dividend of the economy growing and, particularly where there's opportunity for productivity increases, that that is flowing through to increases in real wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This underscores the very difficult position we're in right now, where inflation is galloping ahead rapidly and there is really no response, at this stage, coming from the government. It will be interesting to see what they'll need to do in the upcoming October budget to dramatically address runaway inflation. With the government not doing anything, we're only going to see the Reserve Bank doing the majority of heavy lifting, which will be through higher interest rates. We don't want to see interest rates any higher than they need to be, and we don't want to see the destruction of people's finances, whether that be through wage reductions—like those we will see with low-paid workers because of inflation versus Fair Work Commission decisions on increases, resulting in negative growth in real wages—or through other impacts of inflation destroying the value of self-funded retirees' savings and the savings of all retired Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation is an enormous challenge to be addressed, and this motion did, when it was relevant, seek to make important points about the significance of increasing real wages. I'm in this building to be a part of growing the wealth of all Australians, and real wages growth is a very important part of that. This government is not achieving that. That is regrettable. They hold the policy levers to do that. Of course, they will have a budget coming out in a little over a month's time. That's the real challenge: to see what the government are going to do to arrest runaway inflation, because we can't have wages chasing inflation rates of seven, eight or nine per cent or whatever they may get to, and we don't want the Reserve Bank being the only people pulling policy levers to address inflation. On the fiscal side, there's a lot that can be done by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion, and the fact that it is now so out of date and therefore incorrect, is the best example of how vital the job of the Treasurer is: to do something meaningful in the upcoming budget to achieve an increase in real wages rather than say they're going to do it and, when figures are subsequently released, find out that in fact they have not.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I too rise to speak on this important motion, and I thank the member for Bendigo for raising this for debate today, because it is a very important issue. At the time of the federal election in May this year, Australians had suffered through more than two years of COVID. This included people losing their jobs or losing shifts and hours. At the same time, the cost of living and prices for essential items continued to increase. Housing costs and rents were going through the roof. Interest rates were rising for the first time in years. You'd think that, in that climate, a rise in the minimum wage would be a no-brainer. But it was only Labor that openly called for it and supported it. We unashamedly put forward our submission to the Fair Work Commission advocating for an immediate wage increase for Australia's lowest-paid workers. I'm very proud that the Fair Work Commission delivered a 5.2 per cent rise in the minimum wage, slightly above the headline inflation at the time. This translates to around $40 a week difference for full-time workers on the minimum wage or low-paid awards, and this will make a difference to the lives of many of our lowest-paid workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that many of these workers are young people and often female. They often find themselves in precarious and casual employment, not knowing from week to week what their shifts are, what they'll be earning et cetera. Many of them are on the front line delivering essential services, and they were there delivering those essential services during our COVID-19 pandemic. They are suffering—suffering real and ongoing financial hardship. These people kept the economy going during the worst of the pandemic in our aged-care homes, hospitality and service industries, and deep-cleaning services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For nearly a decade, low wages were a deliberate design feature of the former Liberal government. They put policies in place that were designed deliberately to keep wages low. Wages didn't only stagnate; they went backwards, thanks to these policies. The former government wouldn't deal with it. They thought there was no problem with that. This was confirmed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics' latest measure on wage growth, published on 17 August. It showed that the latest wage growth for the June 2022 quarter in both the public and private sectors was the highest since September 2013. During the same period, the gender pay gap has increased. It now sits at 14 per cent. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap index, Australia now ranks 70th in the world for women's financial empowerment. This is a shocking drop, especially when you consider that we rank equal first in the world in female education rates. Clearly, our economy does not currently support many women to participate equally in the workforce. This needs to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian should have the right to secure employment, and they should be paid a wage which allows them to live well and in dignity—not precariously from week to week. When we spoke openly in support of a rise in the minimum wage, it heralded a new way of dealing with this important issue. We recognise that things need to change, and we're acting. In addition to supporting a rise in the minimum wage, Labor have committed to making gender pay equality an objective of the Fair Work Act. We will strengthen the Fair Work Commission's powers to order pay increases for workers in low-paid female-dominated industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House recognise that we need both legislative and cultural change, especially following the policies of the past government over the last decade. The Jobs and Skills Summit, which was held last week, demonstrated that for the first time in a very long time we are moving towards change and cooperation. This is more necessary now than ever because there are real structural problems in the Australian economy. According to the latest report by Deloitte Access Economics, business profits grew at double-digit rates over the past year. You might say that's a great thing, but big oil and gas companies almost doubled their profits in six months while wages haven't matched that growth. That's the problem. Some experts say this system is broken— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I, too, thank the member for Bendigo for moving this motion. The decision by the Fair Work Commission to raise the minimum wage means an extra $40 a week for full-time workers on minimum wage or low-paid awards. In my home state of Tasmania there are close to 76,000 people who are benefitting from the 5.2 per cent rise. With inflation at a 21-year high and real wages falling, every little bit extra helps. The CEO of the Tasmanian Council of Social Service, Adrienne Picone, made the point that this increase recognises the challenges that Tasmanian workers on low incomes are facing with high inflation. I'll come to the issue of high inflation a little bit later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a 5.8 per cent increase in the cost of living over the past year. That's a massive increase in Tasmania, as you, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, and the member for Braddon well know. The cost of living in our state is one of the biggest issues facing our constituents. This rings true in the stories that I and, no doubt, you, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, and the member for Braddon hear from our constituents across Tasmania—that the financial pressures Tasmanians are under are immense. I hear stories of people having to put groceries back at the checkout. They're putting off visits to the GP. They're cancelling the family day out because it's too expensive to fill the car up with petrol. Affording the essentials has become increasingly more difficult for Tassie families recently, with the cost of food, housing, health, transport and education all rising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People often talk about Tasmania being a cheaper place to live due to property prices. That's not the case anymore, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, as you would well know, with Hobart being one of the country's fastest-rising property price indicators—it is no longer a cheap place to live. We suffer wages in Tasmania that are lower than the Australian average, yet it's more expensive than ever to have a mortgage and pay the rent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to echo the calls made over the weekend by the Tasmanian Labor leader, Rebecca White, for the Tasmanian government to start getting the basics right when addressing the cost of living. We all have a role to play. We too often hear the Tasmanian state government calling on the federal government to do all the heavy lifting. The state government needs to do its fair share. The skyrocketing cost of living is the biggest issue facing Tasmanians today, perhaps with the exception of health across regional Australia. As Dr Haines, the member for Indi, would know, regional Australia is facing massive issues in health access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of such pressures, I'm proud to be part of a federal government that fought for the lowest-paid workers to get the pay rise they deserve. The very first decision of the Albanese cabinet was to agree on a submission to the Fair Work Commission recommending that Australians get a decent minimum wage increase. It was the very first decision. That set the marker for what this government believes is an important issue going forward—wage justice for Australian workers. The Albanese Labor government does not want to see low-paid workers go backwards. Under the former government, wages were deliberately kept low, and Australian workers were worse off for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It needs to be said time and again that wages were deliberately kept low by the former government. It was a deliberate piece of their economic architecture. It wasn't happenstance, it wasn't a coincidence; the former government deliberately wanted to keep wages low because it saw that as a recipe for economic success. Now workers and their families are paying the price after a decade of wage stagnation. That era is over for cleaners, carers, shop assistants and the other heroes of the pandemic who put themselves on the line to keep Australia functioning over the last 2½ years. Workers know they now have a government that will show up and fight for them. Workers have a government that will fight to address issues like weak wage growth, flatlining productivity, the gender pay gap, skills shortages and barriers to work. One example is last week's two-day Jobs and Skills Summit. There were great ideas. More than a hundred Australians came together, building bridges, to try to find a common way forward to get the country out of the mess that we find ourselves in after 10 years of inaction. We have really great hopes for the future out of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to come to the issue of inflation. There has been no wage growth over the past few years. Workers and wages have not caused the inflation issue. We have record profits in this country. We have a demand and supply issue. I call on corporate Australia to do its fair share of the heavy lifting, look at the profits it's taking home for shareholders, and bring down some of those prices, which are far in excess of their costs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I'm using my first motion of this parliament to draw attention to the housing crisis in regional Australia. Let me say it simply: there is nowhere to live in the region. A few months ago, I met a woman who applied for 170 rentals in Wodonga before she found a place. Every business I speak to says they're unable to fill their roles because people cannot find anywhere to live in town. The prices tell the story. For renters, the average price to rent a three-bedroom house in towns like Wangaratta, Wodonga, Benalla and Mansfield is now hitting $400 a week. n our region, this is just unheard of. Buying a house is getting harder too, and it has got harder fast. In the last two years, prices are up 33 per cent in Wodonga, 34 per cent in Wangaratta and 25 per cent in Benalla. In Bright, it's 55 per cent. This is just out of control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've put forward this motion to sound the alarm on the housing crisis and also to make the case that we do not just have an affordability problem; we have an availability problem. Both parties like to put forward policies that simply throw fuel on the fire by subsidising people to purchase houses. What we need is a comprehensive plan to actually better match supply and demand for housing. In the regions, we're simply not building enough houses to accommodate our rapidly rising population, especially since the pandemic, with people going regional out of the cities. Right now, Wangaratta can't build any more houses because the main sewer line is at capacity. It will cost hundreds of millions to upgrade that infrastructure, and that's money that a regional council doesn't just have lying around. Benalla has a similar problem. It needs $10 million worth of drainage works done in the west and north-west of the town. Otherwise you just can't build more homes there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be making strategic investments in infrastructure in our regional towns that would unlock more housing supply. The housing problem is probably the biggest economic handbrake we are facing. Businesses can't fill their jobs because prospective workers cannot move to town. If you solve housing, you go a long way to solving the regional workforce problem. If you solve the workforce problem, our towns can really start to blossom. I've put a proposal to government to set up a dedicated regional housing infrastructure investment fund. The current policy framework set up by the last government, the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, has manifestly failed to meaningfully solve this problem. In the five years since it was set up, it has spent just 40 per cent of its allocated funding and helped build just 1,400 dwellings a year across the entire country. The proof is in the pudding; the problem is just getting worse. Clearly, the former government's policy didn't work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new government announced last week that it was releasing $575 million from this fund. That's good and it's a start, but I want to see that money actually get out the door and into the regions—to regions such as mine. I want money urgently targeted to regional Australia. I want to see that it gets to the critical infrastructure priorities holding back new housing supply in the regions. In Indi, we've got people sleeping in tents in numbers we have never seen before. It's frequently below zero degrees in the mornings these days. Many of these people have jobs and they still can't find somewhere to live. And, whether people have a job or not, surely we are decent enough as a country that we should not be letting people fall behind like this. It's a problem that affects us all. The new government needs to offer something more than what's been put on the table thus far. We need to think a bit differently and we need to think contextually. We need to think about rural and regional Australia and what we need there to open up housing stock—and, by that, I mean housing stock that's at all levels. We need something creative. We don't want to create suburbia in our regional towns, but we need medium-density housing, we need social housing and we need clever housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not leave this place—this parliament—without making a lot of effort in this area. It's work I will do every day because we in Indi come from a beautiful part of the world and we have jobs aplenty. We have an enormous desire for people to come and live in our region, and we have a strong desire to look after those people who are sleeping rough and to give them a chance. I want to see this government do something substantial, creative and nation-building on regional infrastructure and on housing in particular.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  Let me be clear for the benefit of the member for Indi. This government does understand the significance of homelessness, and we do understand that it's an issue not just of housing affordability but also of access. The fact is that we've got far too few homes in this country for people to live in, whether you're working or not. We recognise it. We know it's a major issue, and we will work with state and territory governments and all stakeholders to tackle this massive issue head-on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a massive issue. The member for Indi has identified it very well. But I'm proud to be a member of a government led by the Prime Minister who understands, from personal experience, the importance of safe and affordable housing. He has lived experience of this issue. He grew up in social housing in Sydney, and he is leading a government committed to improving housing in Australia. Anybody who's listened to the Prime Minister would know of the importance of safe and secure shelter for people being able to get on with their lives. He recognises this down to his bones, and he's leading a government that takes this issue very seriously. We've elevated the portfolios of housing and homelessness into cabinet, such is our commitment to ensuring this issue gets the ventilation it requires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud of the work that the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness—my friend and fellow Tasmanian the member for Franklin, Julie Collins—is doing in this area. From day one the minister has jumped right in and worked hard to deal with issues that we as a government and as a nation are facing within the scope of these portfolios. As soon she was sworn in, the minister hosted a meeting of housing ministers from across the country and made strong first steps in addressing the challenges across Australia. This was a significant moment. It was the first time in almost five years that Australia's housing ministers had sat in a room together to discuss the issues facing our country and how governments could work together to deal with them. This will not be the last time they meet either. The housing ministers will meet again in the coming days to continue these discussions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Lyons, as in most of Tasmania—and, indeed, in the member for Indi's electorate—people are struggling with high rents, unaffordability, inaccessibility, inability to secure finance from banks due to the need for high deposits, and, of course, tradie shortages. We said last week that we were releasing $575 million, but, frankly, there's a shortage of labour. We could release money into the economy right now to build homes, but there's nobody to build them. The critical supplies aren't there, and the supplies that are there have gone up between 40 and 50 per cent in cost. If you talk to any builder or to any tradie who's working in construction, you will find that these are the issues they face. We know we've got a construction boom going on; they can't keep up with the demand. But prices have gone so far out of kilter that, at the same time we have a construction boom, we have construction firms going bust. It's an awful situation that the country's facing, and there's no easy solution. But we are committed to tackling it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with the member for Indi in agreeing that we have not built enough homes in the public sector—in the social housing sector—for decades. I can certainly look at the last nine years, under the previous government, but, frankly, it goes beyond that, and I won't pretend that it doesn't. I think that for decades federal governments and, particularly, state governments of all stripes have dropped the ball big-time on housing, particularly affordable housing. They've left it to the charity sector and to the private sector, thinking that's a problem they don't need to deal with, and now it's facing us starkly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing is one of the issues in my electorate—cost of living and health being the other two—that keep me awake at night. The once renowned Australian dream of owning your own home is now but a pipedream for many young Tasmanians and many other young Australians. There has been a massive failure by governments of the past to ensure that people can get into the housing market and live in secure and affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is fighting to turn this historic neglect around and focusing on providing for Australians. We made it clear during the election that we are serious about tackling the housing crisis—and it is a housing crisis. We brought to the people our housing reform agenda, which included the development of a national housing and homelessness plan. It's something we remain committed to. It's 30,000 homes over five years. Sure, that's not enough—I'm not going to pretend that it is—but it's a start, and it's certainly a lot more than we had under the previous government. It's an indication of how seriously we are taking this issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  It's no surprise to me that Mayo continues to attract a growing number of new residents to live in our beautiful hills and coastal regions. Between 2016 and 2021, our community of Mayo collectively absorbed an extra 33,368 people—more than 10,000 families. During this time, median weekly rental payments in Mayo have increased by far more than people's wages. Median weekly rental costs now represent close to half of a weekly income—more than half once utilities are considered. The Domain Rental Report in March this year indicated that Mount Barker residents experienced a 25 per cent increase over that time. Even more worryingly, down at Victor Harbour and on the south coast, there was a 62.5 per cent increase over that period. This is in part because we have such an influx of people, and it is also a holiday community. When I look at the fact that there are so many older Australians in my community on the age pension and renting, it is deeply worrying. What this means for my constituents is that affordable properties, particularly for those on a low fixed income, are very few and far between. Like the member for Indi, I am now seeing people rough sleeping, couch surfing and camping in car parks in tents. This never happened in Mayo, but it's happening now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mayo is not alone. A recent briefing from the community housing and homelessness sector provided an insight into new Impact Economics analysis exploring the role of housing in critical skills shortages across the regions. In short, there is no surprise that no housing means no worker mobility. In each area examined by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Housing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ritical</span> report, rental costs are up by high margins, severe housing stress is up, job vacancies have climbed and rental vacancies have plummeted. The report found that on the Fleurieu Peninsula rents are, on average, up 48 per cent since March 2020. Job vacancies are off the chart, with an estimated cost of more than $200 million each year to that region alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of the jobs summit, we need to keep front of mind the enormous pressures on regional Australia's housing, insufficient supply and exorbitant prices. I warned during the last parliament of an impending tsunami of homelessness due to poor access to affordable housing. At the time, I requested that the three tiers of government work together to establish a national strategy to increase housing supply and improve affordability. I therefore welcomed the government's commitment to develop a new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, and the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund for social and affordable housing, but I'm also in favour of a new, improved generation scheme, like NRAS. I will just say to the government that we've got thousands of properties still within NRAS that are yet to expire. Please look to extend those properties beyond their date because, otherwise, we're going to face a valley of death with respect to affordable housing stock that's currently there in the market but will potentially be gone in a matter of years, when NRAS finishes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Indi points out, more is needed in the regions. Like Mayo, the member for Indi's electorate has also experienced significant population growth, and so has regional Australia. This growth puts great pressure on regional infrastructure, our water, our drainage and our power, with more users using our road and transport systems. There is increasing demand on housing, local health and community services, and more. The member's proposed $2 billion regional housing infrastructure fund would be used by regional councils to provide for critical infrastructure to strengthen these foundations for the building of new housing. I urge the government to consider this very, very carefully. We need to ensure that regional Australia is not left behind with respect to affordable housing as well as our needs for child care, community centres and other infrastructure. If we want decentralisation and if we want our regions to thrive, we need to invest in them. I urge the government to consider this motion by the member for Indi.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  In my electorate on the New South Wales South Coast, we have been facing a regional housing crisis for years. Then came the bushfires, the floods and the pandemic. Make no mistake, this housing crisis is the new disaster. It needs immediate action and more temporary disaster accommodation. Let me explain why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not okay for 50 families to be homeless at the Moruya North Head Campground. I hear stories each day from people coming into my office, pleading for help. Amy from Nowra is a single mother of seven children. She has exhausted all her emergency housing avenues and now faces living on the streets because there are simply no three-bedroom houses available. My office has successfully gained her a nine-day emergency housing extension, but what then? All of our fabulous support services, like Salt Care community housing providers and the Homeless Hub, are working around the clock to help. Amy says that all she wants is a roof over their head, something we all deserve, and we are doing everything to help her. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the pregnant mother of two from Worrigee who has fled from domestic violence. She's applied for 50 private rentals and says that, because she has been honest about her situation, no-one will rent her a home. We've helped her access the Start Safely program and hope this will help. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jade from Batehaven is in her late 60s. The owner of the house she called home for a decade asked her to leave so they could renovate. She ended up spending winter in her car, with her dog, because she couldn't find anywhere to live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anthony from Bomaderry is a young dad, engaged to his partner, and with two kids. He works full time in a supermarket but was on the cusp of homelessness. I wrote to the New South Wales housing minister and helped him secure private accommodation with a subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the heart-wrenching stories I am hearing every day. We are doing everything to help, but sometimes that is not enough. It's a cliche but it's true: there is no silver bullet for a decade of housing neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In such a beautiful area like ours, there are a lot of people with holiday homes, and often they are empty most of the year. In a desperate bid to free up some housing quickly, the mayor of the Eurobodalla Shire wrote to all their non-resident ratepayers, asking if they would rent their houses out to help ease housing pressures. The mayor told the member for Eden-Monaro and me recently about the fantastic response they received. They have had over 150 interested homeowners. Thirty homes have now re-entered the rental market, which is a great response, but it isn't enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with Peter from Salt Care. He has some fabulous ideas about how we can turn a further 500 vacant homes across the Eurobodalla and the Shoalhaven into social and affordable homes for long-term rental. As part of the Collective Home Project, Salt will pay market rent, manage the maintenance and support the tenants, so that everyone can get what they need. Salt wants to work across all levels of government on this project, including incorporating the Eurobodalla mayor's tiny homes idea. It is absolutely incredible to see innovative ideas coming from our community sector. That's what we need: everyone working together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week I will be talking with the minister about that and seeing how we can help, but it's going to take time to address the systemic housing issues. We've started developing a National Housing and Homelessness Plan to guide our response. The government took another step last week, freeing up $575 million from the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, an underutilised program, to invest in social and affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to support crisis and transitional housing options for women and children fleeing domestic violence. That's why I was proud to commit $1.5 million on the South Coast and Southern Highlands for additional crisis accommodation for women and children fleeing violence. We expect this will help as many as 135 women and children to find refuge and fund 13 workers to support 1,040 women. It's really important funding, and I know it will make a difference. We've got our Housing Australia Future Fund to create 30,000 social and affordable homes, including $30 million specifically allocated for housing and specialist support for veterans at risk or experiencing homelessness. All of this will be informed by the new National Housing Supply and Affordability Council. There is so much more work to be done. Housing is an incredibly complex issue, but we have started, we're working together and we will work hard to find solutions that will work for regional Australia. </span>

They rejected the Morrison Liberal government's refusal to take action on climate change; the blatant disregard for science; and the brutal and senseless climate wars that prevented any real action on climate change for more than a decade. Australians also understand that we have a very important role to play as a member of the Pacific family and that taking action on climate change is a crucial issue for our Pacific neighbours.

Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison's inaction on climate change, cuts to development assistance, poor management of Pacific labour mobility programs and disrespect for our Pacific neighbours eroded trust in Australia across the region. The Morrison government underinvested in core elements of our international relations and left vacuums for others to fill. The former Liberal government slashed Australia's official development assistance budget by $11.8 billion, shut down the Australia Network and forced the cessation of ABC short-wave radio transmission in the Pacific—a service which, according to reports, has now been taken over by Chinese state owned radio providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, however, has long advocated for deeper engagement with Pacific countries to meet our shared challenges and build our region's resilience. That's why the Albanese Labor government has hit the ground running, with the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the Minister for International Development and the Pacific all spending significant time in the Pacific in our first 100 days of government. Labor will continue to strengthen Australia's Pacific partnerships by delivering a comprehensive package of new programs to secure our region and build a stronger Pacific family. Australia is proud to be part of the Pacific family, but being part of a family means that you listen to each other, and the Pacific family have been very clear: climate change is the No. 1 security threat to both their nations and their peoples. Australia stands shoulder to shoulder with Pacific island countries in response to the climate change crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister joined Pacific island leaders in Fiji last July declaring a climate emergency and a commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This was an incredibly important meeting and one that had been long overdue, and it was vital in being able to reset our relationships in the Pacific and send a very clear message not just to our region but to everyone watching that the Australian government is taking this issue extremely seriously and that we understand our Pacific neighbours' anxiety about the lack of action on climate change for the last decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The diplomatic agreement that was reached at that meeting in Fiji has already been followed with concrete action, and that is exactly what our Pacific neighbours want to see. The Albanese Labor government has passed the Climate Change Bill 2022 through the lower house. That bill will deliver on our election commitment to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050. We have also internationally agreed to these targets by signing up to them at the United Nations. The Albanese Labor government has also made a bid to host a United Nations conference of the parties on climate change by 2024, in partnership with the Pacific. I can't think of anywhere more appropriate to host a climate change global conference than in the Pacific. Labor committed to this during the election. We intend to see it through because, unlike the former Liberal government, we will always work in partnership with Pacific nations, because that's what families do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  I thank the member for Jagajaga for this important motion. No-one, in our near global neighbourhood, understands the existential threat of climate change better than our Pacific neighbours. Recently I participated in a multiparty parliamentary delegation to Fiji funded through Save the Children Fund and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I wish to discuss three issues we addressed through this delegation, each of which is fundamental to this motion. The first is ambitious policy to respond to climate change through scientifically driven emissions reductions targets. The second is disaster relief. The third is building economic resilience by expanding our Australian Pacific workforce partnerships in the agricultural sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I will talk about climate. It was a great honour to meet the secretary-general, Henry Puna, at the Pacific Islands Forum. Mr Puna described the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the crucial top-order priority of a scientifically backed response to climate. This was not new. The Pacific Islands Forum was formed in 1971, and the Pacific Islands Forum have been global leaders for more than a decade in calling for action. Climate action and climate adaptation are already happening at speed in the Pacific islands. They have no choice. Take biosecurity as an example. Climate change is threatening biodiversity and food security in Fiji. I visited the Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees. They're responsible for the conservation of the region's genetic resources, especially food, and they maintain an extraordinary seed and plant tissue bank. I visited the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, and they're focusing on emerging pests and diseases in the Pacific. They were clear when they told me that climate change is creating new challenges for them. Australian investment in these centres is not only vital to Fiji, but it's vital to us here and our agricultural industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is the impact of climate change more dramatic than on the frequency and the intensity of extreme weather events in Fiji. In December 2020, at Christmas time, Cyclone Yasa, a massive category 5 storm, hit the islands of Fiji, and those communities are still desperately trying to recover. The people in many villages I visited told me that cyclones such as Yasa had never before affected their particular islands. They were absolutely clear that this type of storm was something they had never experienced in Fiji before. Those people—like many of our bushfire victims—are living in tents, and COVID has had a devastating impact on their recovery. It's been so slow and so difficult. I visited health clinics and women's projects, and everyone, without exception, talked to me about the physical and psychological impact of climate change and their feelings that the world is acting way, way too slowly—because climate change is not going slowly in Fiji. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I met with several communities who participate in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, the PALM scheme. The importance of this scheme to the economic stability of Fiji cannot be underestimated. It's not just good for us in our agricultural centre, but it's crucial to economic security and relationship building with Fiji. I was profoundly struck by how much the Fijians supported this scheme. Being able to have a family member travel to Australia to work in the agricultural sector and send wages home was transforming people's lives and transforming communities. With the incursion of rising sea levels in the Pacific and the relocation of villages, the economic opportunity that PALM offers is not to be underestimated. And yet there are many workers across the Pacific who want to come—and many Australian farmers are crying out for more farm workers—but there are such long delays in getting them here. Recently I heard from one of my berry growers who lost 80 per cent of her harvest last summer because there was no ability for those Pacific island workers to get to her farm. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to think creatively about how it can solve these urgent problems. There are 50,000 people waiting to come here on the PALM scheme. I urge the government to look beyond that, too, to a broader agricultural visa to address our desperate need for agricultural workers and the important economic impact it has on these communities. I urge the government this week as the Senate debates the Climate Change Bill. We've passed it through the House, and, while I was pleased to support it and have my amendments successfully moved, we need to do better. Forty-three per cent is not enough. We must do better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I want to thank the member for Jagajaga for this important motion, because Australia is proud to be a longstanding and deeply engaged member of our Pacific family across the three regions of Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia. We have strong relationships with countries and peoples across these three regions, which we saw senior Australian leaders reaffirm immediately following the election of the Albanese government. In the government's first 100 days, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and other ministers visited Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. This sent a clear message about Australia's contribution in the region as a partner of choice and about our desire to be reliable, to turn up, to show respect, to listen, and to be transparent and open. These visits signalled that Australia will be an honest partner on issues that the Pacific cares about and will respond to shared challenges like climate change, COVID-19 and development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is working hard to repair some of the reputational damage done by those opposite since 2013. When in office, the opposition undermined Australia's standing in the Pacific by cutting aid by $11 billion in 2015 and by dismissing the Pacific's vital interests on climate change. Who can forget former prime minister Scott Morrison, current Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton and others laughing at jokes about Pacific island countries being swallowed up by the effects of climate change? This government, the Albanese government, is bringing new energy, respect and resources to the region to help build a stronger Pacific family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that climate change is the single biggest threat to the security, livelihoods and wellbeing of many of our island-nation neighbours. It is an urgent global challenge, and it is one in which we will play our part to help tackle. Towards this end, our government will increase support to the Pacific through a new Pacific Climate Infrastructure Financing Partnership for climate related infrastructure and energy projects in the Pacific and Timor-Leste. We'll also increase official development assistance by $525 million over the next four years, including to address climate change adaptation and resilience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting in July welcomed Australia's renewed commitment to Pacific climate change priorities. At this meeting, Australia joined Pacific leaders in declaring that the region is facing a climate emergency. We also stressed the urgency of lifting our ambition to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Pacific leaders welcomed our interest in partnering with the Pacific to host a future UN climate change conference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Pacific island countries for being world leading in their commitment to addressing climate change. They're on the front line and they're facing more extreme-weather events, such as cyclones and flooding, and rising oceans. These will have a direct impact on people's access to fresh water and on major essential industries such as fisheries, forestry, agriculture and tourism, all of which could seriously suffer from the effects of climate change. I'm proud to be part of a government that pledges to listen to and to stand shoulder to shoulder with our Pacific family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is also strengthening cultural and sporting ties. Sports diplomacy can play to Australia's strengths in the Pacific by leveraging our shared love of various codes like rugby union, NRL and cricket. After meeting with PNG's Prime Minister Marape in July, Prime Minister Albanese suggested potentially creating an NRL team for PNG, possibly including the wider Pacific. As the Prime Minister said, rugby league is one of Australia's proudest legacies in Papua New Guinea. As I'm sure you'd agree, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, rugby union is much loved in many of our key Pacific countries. I want to congratulate Rugby Australia, who's got the women's A team going to Fiji in January next year. As well as cultural, church and historical connections, sport is among the visceral ties between Australia and our Pacific family. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  The opposition welcomes the motion from the member for Jagajaga in relation to our Pacific family and the role that Australia has played for a long time in supporting our region and the peoples of the Pacific. It was, of course, the Turnbull, Abbott and Morrison governments that stepped up and ensured that Australian foreign policy pivoted from the rest of the world to our region, and we weren't alone in doing this. For those members who were here, you will recall President Obama announced on the floor of this House that US foreign policy would also pivot to our region. This was continued by President Trump and has been continued by President Biden. What it says is that in foreign policy terms the Pacific region is one of the most significant to the world and also to the United States of America but, most importantly, to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Pacific family came first under the previous government, it came first in our foreign policy objectives and it came first in our aid and other delivery budgets. That's why most of our aid budget was spent in the Pacific. That's why Australia is still the largest development partner of every single country in the Pacific today. We welcome the government continuing the policy to ensure that this region is at the forefront of Australian foreign policy and at the forefront of our development dollar. We know that our family here in the Pacific is the most important for the security of our region, for the economic prosperity of our region and for the success of the peoples of it. That's where we could recommend to the government that they enhance a motion such as this from the member for Jagajaga.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They could have spoken about some of the economic challenges that face our region. When you go to the countries of the Pacific, as I had the opportunity to in government as the minister, you'll see the abject poverty that many people live in, in the Pacific. It's a serious issue. Abject poverty has led to malnutrition. Malnutrition has led to issues like stunting of entire populations and generations of young people, which Australians still don't know enough about. I believe it's incumbent on all of us here—and I know the government shares my view—to do as much as possible to help our Pacific neighbours—our friends and family—to make sure that we lift people out of this abject poverty and malnutrition, and to make sure they have healthy lives. We welcome motions like this, which promote healthy living and ensure that Australia will be at the forefront of efforts to do just that in the Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is, of course, a significant concern. When you go to places like Tuvalu you understand that the highest elevation is about two metres above sea level—any human population on the archipelagos of Tuvalu will always and primarily be very concerned, every single day, with changes in the climate, changes in the weather and changes in the sea levels. Coming from an island like Australia, with huge mountain regions, it's hard to understand the psychology, but when you go there you see two metres above sea level is the highest elevation. It's a prime concern. We understand that, and we accept it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will, as it says here, continue our government's policy of having climate at the centre of our infrastructure development, and that's why Australia has been such a good partner for this region. The infrastructure we build is resilient for the climate. It has to take into account the frequent tropical storms and cyclones that have happened in the region over many generations and that happen more these days. There frequent and extreme weather events are mentioned here. Our funding has been resilient and has taken climate into account, and it's better placed than all of the other efforts that come from other partners of the Pacific in this region. That's why Australia has spoken loudly about other partners—and there are some notable ones, whether they be the United States or China—who come into this region and spend their development dollars in a way that is not resilient for the climate. There are plenty of examples of environmental disasters from other countries that do not take the care that Australia takes in relation to environmental projects or economic projects in the region. They have wrecked the environment of many particular countries. You can go to examples in PNG and Solomon Islands, where we've seen the strip-logging of forests and vegetation in the most environmentally unfriendly way. We've seen pristine waters spoiled by mining operations from certain countries and partners that wreck the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition knows that Australia has always had a very, very good environmental record in the Pacific region. It's our backyard, just like it is our prime foreign policy area, and we would never despoil the environment of Pacific, but that's not the attitude of other partners. We welcome motions like this that recognise Australia's role and we support the government in its attempts to keep the Pacific at the forefront of foreign policy, but we take to task those partners who do not have the care or concern for the peoples of the Pacific at the heart of their agenda. We say that Australia will always put the people of the Pacific first.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and Sri Lanka celebrated 75 years of diplomatic relations this year, and we share a longstanding history of bilateral relations and extensive links underpinned by our amazing 170,000-strong Sri Lanka diaspora community here in Australia. Sadly, Sri Lanka is facing a multidimensional crisis compounded by shortages of food and essential medicines, threatened livelihoods, high inflation, rising commodity prices, power shortages and a lack of fuel. The economic crisis is the worst since the country's independence. The recent economic and political crisis in Sri Lanka has affected not only the great people of Sri Lanka but also the Sri Lankan Australians whose families and loved ones have been caught up in this crisis. The scarcity of fuel and food, as I've said, is having a devastating emotional impact on our local Australian-Sri Lankan community. I have a large Sri Lankan-Australian community in my electorate of La Trobe and I've heard their stories of hardship, anxiety and mental distress due to the state of their families, friends and fellow Sri Lankans as a result of this terrible crisis in their beloved country. I understand their pain for their loved ones back home, as I hear about it every day. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great honour to attend the 'Dance for a Cause' Save a Dream fundraiser dinner dance on Friday 19 August at the Claydon community centre, at the invitation of Dr Lionel Bopage, President, and Ms Sithy Marikar, Vice-President, of the Australian Sri Lankan Association Incorporated. I acknowledge the member for Bruce, Julian Hill, who was also there. I thank him very much for his support and for his support of this motion. The Save a Dream team is a collective of community organisations and individuals in Australia formed in the wake of the current dire socioeconomic crisis in Sri Lanka. The funds raised go towards helping save the lives of newborns—it is just so sad to hear 'newborns'—who require medical attention by assisting in the purchase of much-needed medicines and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday, at the invitation of Naween Pandithasekara and Damitha De Mel from Black &amp; Gold Victoria, I took part in the launching ceremony of a fundraiser cycling campaign for Sri Lanka. Black &amp; Gold Victoria Incorporated has initiated a campaign to raise funds to procure much-needed medicine, equipment and medical apparatus for the Apeksha cancer hospital in Sri Lanka. Again, it's very sad to hear that it's a children's hospital needs this equipment. The appeal, named Ride for Apeksha, is a challenge for all supporters to ride up to 976 kilometres—that's the number of beds in this hospital—in 40 days, from 1 September to 10 October, to raise funds. This initiative is supported by Rotary Australia, and funds are collected under the auspices of the Rotary Australia Overseas Aid Fund. It is doing a great job there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say, on a personal note, I went to an event organised by Wings of Hope, again supporting Sri Lankan children. My wife and I decided we should do our little bit by sponsoring the education of a young girl in Sri Lanka. I congratulate Wings of Hope, because it's the little things, and if more people made the effort to provide just a bit of funding each month, they could actually change a young person's life. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current economic crisis in Sri Lanka is propelling into a humanitarian crisis. My heart goes out, again, to the Sri Lankan community at this terrible time. I can assure the Sri Lankan community of the unwavering support of coalition members but also government members. The great thing is that the previous Liberal government and the new Labor government have given bipartisan support to providing humanitarian assistance, including health equipment, to our great friends in Sri Lanka. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the House to acknowledge the anxiety and distress that the Sri Lankan-Australian community is experiencing due to this crisis. I mention again the huge bond of friendship between our two nations. I thank the Sri Lankan community for always being so warm and gracious. I've been to many events in the Buddhist Vihara temple in Berwick, and I've been to so many Buddhist temples, and the Sri Lankan people are so compassionate. They've done so well helping others in Australia, and now they're raising money to help Sri Lankans back home. Again, it's just so sad to hear that newborns and children are in the front line of this disaster.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I'll second the motion. I'm pleased to second the motion moved by a Liberal member of parliament because this is a bipartisan endeavour, and there's concern right across the parliament about the situation that we have seen and are continuing to see in Sri Lanka. I acknowledge your work as my neighbour, Member for La Trobe. We keep it a secret that we actually do collaborate in the community interest and call each other and sort out community issues, because it would be bad for both of our reputations if people knew that! It's a bit like you and me, Member for Mitchell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is enormous sadness and anger about the situation in Sri Lanka, in this the 75th anniversary year of diplomatic relations between Australia and Sri Lanka. The economic crisis and, indeed, the civil unrest should never have happened. We should not be in this situation. I say that in that Sri Lanka is a country I know and love. When I was in high school, an exchange student from Sri Lanka lived with us for nine months—my Sri Lankan brother from up in Kandy, as we call each other. For the rest of her life, my mum—his Aussie mum—went backwards and forwards, spending months at a time in Kandy. People looked at the wedding photos she proudly brought back of her other son. She was always the white chick in the saree at weddings and family gatherings. It's a place I've visited on personal trips, and, indeed, it was the last place I visited before COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sri Lanka has a complex history. It's a multiethnic, multicultural, multireligious and multilingual country. But things could or should have been very different. Sri Lanka is a country blessed with its geography, sitting right off the coast of India near the entrance to the Bay of Bengal, in a part of the world that's so economically vibrant, with a multicultural, multilingual population perfectly poised to engage in trade with the world. Someone said that, if Sri Lankan governments had followed perhaps a different course over many years, it should have been the Singapore of this part of the world. It has incredible natural resources and truly wonderful, beautiful people. And perhaps not all the legacy of colonialism is positive, but it has the base level of infrastructure in governance systems that should have set the country up to succeed. That's what my Sri Lankan friends tell me. Instead, we've seen a failure of governance over many years. I make that point in a very general sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my community have pointed out to me the endemic corruption over so many years. People can insert their own villains into this. I'm not going to make it a political speech; I'm not trying to set off stuff in the diaspora. But people have observed—and I think with a lot of evidence—that this is a sustained failure of governance over so many years that has led such a beautiful country to the place they're at now, where a moment of such promise economically after the end of the civil war is now a moment of such hardship and despair for so many people. Of course, it's not just for the people in Sri Lanka that we worry; it's for the more than 170,000 Australians of Sri Lankan origin, be they born in Sri Lanka or be they of Sri Lankan descent. Indeed, I think they're our 10th-largest ethnic group in Australia, and we have one of the largest, if not the world's largest, Sri Lankan diaspora.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's enormous pain and worry and anger here. Fifty per cent of these Australians live in Melbourne, many of them in the south-east. There are Tamils, Sinhalese, Burghers, Moors, Malays and people of Chinese origin, all of whom call themselves Sri Lankan Australians. People are not getting basic supplies. They're at risk of missing out on food. They can't get petrol. And the medical crisis is heart wrenching. On one of our trips, my daughter's life was saved in a hospital in Sri Lanka. It's a story I've told elsewhere for other reasons. She diagnosed herself. She said, 'Dad, I think I've got a DVT.' She was a medical centre receptionist for her part-time uni job. I said, 'Oh, that's a bit dramatic, darling. Have some porridge.' She said, 'No, no, we've got to go to the hospital; I've got a DVT.' Sure enough. Our friends rallied to the cause and got us through, and it was a Sri Lankan specialist in the ICU ward who did indeed save her life from that blood clot. She will be on blood thinners for the rest of her life. So I know firsthand that the quality in many of the hospitals is world class. They have good surgeons, many of whom trained overseas, and they are doing good work, but they now can't get supplies. People are worried about their family and friends getting into a medical emergency. I applaud the Australian Sri Lankan community for their generosity, for raising money—so much of it for the children's hospitals—and for bringing the whole community together. I particularly applaud my long-term staff member and now volunteer Sithy Marikar, who I've known for many a year, for her leadership within the Sri Lankan Muslim community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One final thing I would confirm is that the government will continue to provide humanitarian and development assistance. I'm also in dialogue with the minister for immigration and home affairs regarding some of the two-way visa issues, both about people not wanting to return, given the medical care issues right now, and also the need to continue to be reasonable on allowing people to visit.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to support the member for La Trobe on this important motion that the Australian parliament recognise what Sri Lanka has been going through in recent times, since the COVID-19 pandemic. I join my friends, the member for La Trobe and the member for Bruce, in speaking about the importance, after 75 years, of this relationship between Australia and Sri Lanka not just in managing our maritime borders and managing people smuggling but in our economic and people-to-people links which have led to a big diaspora in our major cities of people who have come from Sri Lanka and made Australia their home. And they've been very successful at it, I must say. They are skilled and successful migrants who have turned themselves into great Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all devastated to see what has happened to Sri Lanka. It has salient lessons for all countries around the world following the COVID-19 pandemic. It isn't automatic that a country will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic better, stronger or as well placed as some have. There were real consequences for an economy like Sri Lanka's in terms of turning off tourism, turning off expat dollars coming into the country and turning off important things like access to cheap fuel to power their power plants. It's a salient lesson for governments everywhere, including here, about what happens when you deliberately increase the price of power, power generation, fuel, fuel generation and the basics of living, such as food. What we saw in Sri Lanka, of course, is that, when a government fails in this department of the basic costs of living—the cost of power, the cost of fuel and the cost of food—it leads to revolution because people can't afford to eat and they can't afford the basics. We all lament what has happened in Sri Lanka, but we must observe the lessons of the failure of the government. I know that Australia will take those lessons on board as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No country is immune from these challenges in this era, and we see the countries of Europe facing the same problems with the cost of power and the cost of power generation, and the impacts that that will have on the basic standard of living of populations. So, as the opposition, we ask the Australian government to do whatever it can to help our Sri Lankan partners. We welcome Sri Lanka's move to approach the International Monetary Fund and secure that vital loan to make sure that they can sustain their debt—a very serious debt now, which has hit about 79 per cent of GDP—pay that debt, and not be in debt to countries that seek to take advantage of these situations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, of course, is a good partner in all of these situations. We will help Sri Lanka with our development dollars. We'll help Sri Lanka as friends and partners and neighbours in our region, and, of course, we won't be seeking a return on that help, other than their success, prosperity and stability. We'll continue to urge the Australian government to do that from the opposition benches. But we have seen with concern, reports that China—who has put itself in a debtor position to Sri Lanka—has asked, instead of payment, to own the resources and the resource generating mechanisms of the country of Sri Lanka while they are in financial crisis and debt. We, of course, urge China to be a good international partner and not to take advantage of countries who fall into economic hard times. We ask them to be the right neighbours that they ought to be to countries in their region and to make sure that they do not seek advantage at the expense of the Sri Lankan people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we welcome the International Monetary Fund lending money to secure the future of Sri Lanka. It's the right deal. It will mean that Sri Lanka will be able to make its payments, get back on its feet, get its tourism economy going, get its expats financing money again, and, of course, restore the great skills and success that we've seen from the migration population that has come to Australia from Sri Lanka. It's a very successful country and it can get back on its feet again, with good government, with stable government and with government fixed on lowering the cost of living for its population. The Australian government ought to do as much as we can do during this economic crisis. We have been supportive. We need to continue to be supportive. I know that the diaspora here in Australia is doing everything it can to support Sri Lanka and make sure that those expat dollars go back home and stabilise the situation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want a strong and sovereign Sri Lanka. We want our friend and partner back on its feet again, succeeding for its population; feeding itself as it always has; succeeding economically; and providing such great, skilled and successful people as it has to the world. Sri Lanka exports so many great products to Australia and around the world. It is a very successful place. It's fallen into a hole. A lot of it has come from COVID. A lot of it has come from some bad decisions. We know Sri Lanka will get back on its feet again. Australia supports Sri Lanka, we support Sri Lanka, and we ask the Australian government to do everything they can to support our good friends and neighbours in Sri Lanka.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I want to thank the member for La Trobe for putting forward this motion and acknowledge his ongoing interest in our local Sri Lankan community. I also thank my colleagues who spoke before me. I want to begin by acknowledging the longstanding and ongoing friendship between Australia and Sri Lanka. This year marks 75 years of diplomatic relations between our two nations, a friendship that shares a proud history of joint cooperation in trade and investment, in education, in our love of sports and in culture and development. Our friendship is supported by a strategic partnership and is also characterised by mutual interests on shaping the future of our region. But it's the people-to-people links which stand out the most for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, I'm very proud of my local Sri Lankan community, which is part of the very large Sri Lankan diaspora across Australia. Their ongoing contribution to the strength of Australian multiculturalism has been significant. Wherever we look, in the fields of education, media, culture, literature, science, medicine, politics, commerce and law, the people who make up the story of the Sri Lankan diaspora here in Australia continue to actively shape our understanding of modern Australia. In any one of these fields, there are prominent Sri Lankan Australians making their mark, and we value their contribution to our skilled migration program and our international education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I'm saddened to be marking this significant occasion against the backdrop of a significant economic crisis and civil unrest in Sri Lanka. There's been a long, systemic downfall of the Sri Lankan economy, with the country now having to import basic staples such as rice. Sri Lanka had been known to all of us, and to the world in general, to be one of the world's leading exporters of that commodity. Sri Lanka has lost a whole season of recovery in agriculture because of policies that were set in place primarily as a result of bad political decisions. Sri Lanka was the breadbasket of rice and tea in the world, with its products renowned globally for their quality and quantity, but those industries are now a shadow of their former selves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues facing Sri Lanka are huge and complex. The lack of fuel has been impacting day-to-day mobility, with people unable to get to work and fuel set aside for emergency services only. Schools are closing down, and infrastructure is at a standstill. Food and fuel are rationed, with many families down to one or two meals a day. Tourism has also been severely impacted, with dire indicators, although it is now one of the only remaining sources of stability in an otherwise stunted economy in free fall. I welcome the Australian government's recent announcement of aid to support Sri Lanka's food and healthcare needs, which is in addition to the allocation in Australia's aid annual budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is right to acknowledge the anxiety and distress that the Sri Lankan Australian community is experiencing as a result of these events. In speaking to this motion, I want to put forward the voices of people in my community who share the anxiety about this experience. I recently caught up with my good friend Chandra Bamunusinghe, who is a prominent leader in our local Sri Lankan community and who, in a recent meeting with members of the Aus-Lanka People's Solidarity, shared concerns regarding the impact of the use of terrorism laws now active in Sri Lanka, with arbitrary arrests of university students, union leaders and people associated with the protest movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My local community is calling for the implementation of the constitutional rights to democracy, freedom of speech and freedom of protest, both in the spirit and the letter of the law. This parliament should share the position held by my constituents, because strengthening regional norms and rules based order requires a commitment to human rights. Australia has been a strong supporter of human rights and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, and I want to see this emphasis as a basis of our relationship continuing into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My local Sri Lankan community maintains very strong links to Sri Lanka, and it is a community that is proud of its diversity and celebrates the different religions, languages and ethnicities that make up the island country. I visited Sri Lanka on a parliamentary delegation some 10 years ago and was very much moved by the beauty of the country, which is matched by the warmth of its people. At that time, their hope and optimism for the future was palpable. While, sadly, the situation now remains dire, I place my confidence in the people of Sri Lanka to overcome this period of turmoil. They are a people whose ingenuity and resilience remain marked features of their proud national identity. I'd like to see us, as Australians, and this parliament, aid and assist the people of Sri Lanka as they move forward into the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think—and I think you'd agree with me, Deputy Speaker Buchholz—that the coalition government from 2013 to 2022 will go down as one of the great governments since Federation. What an economy! What a thing we handed over to the new Labor government! Economically, we had low unemployment rates. The now Prime Minister didn't know the unemployment rate, but the unemployment rate that we handed over to them had a big number 3 in front of it, which hadn't been seen for 50 years. We'd done taxation reform, lowering taxes both for individuals and for small business. We managed a pandemic such as we hadn't seen for 100 years. Australia, by every measure during that pandemic—whether you looked at it economically or you looked at the low fatalities compared to other countries throughout the world—was a great, stellar performer. We also had high vaccination rates. How would you mark the previous government from '13 to '22? You'd give them very high marks on most of the important ways that you judge a government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one, the one that we want to talk about today, is trade. Deputy Speaker Buchholz, you know about this; you're a regional MP as well. We all know how important trade is to the health of our economy. I just want to go through some of the amazing statistics that we as a government achieved in the trade area through the last nine years. You may know, Deputy Speaker, that Australia has made 16 bilateral trade agreements with other countries. Do you know how many of them were put into force by a coalition government? Thirteen of them, and there are multilateral agreements as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does that mean in a practical sense? In a practical sense, it means this. When we came to government in 2013, around 27 per cent of the goods and services that we export were covered by a free trade agreement. Do you know what it is now, Deputy Speaker? You might be surprised to hear—no, you wouldn't be surprised, because you'd be all over this—it's now nearly 80 per cent. That's what we did in the last nine years of government. You want good access to markets for your goods and services, and we instituted free trade agreements that increased the proportion of our goods and services covered by free trade agreements from just over 20 per cent to 80 per cent, an amazing legacy that we've left the new government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With which countries did we do that? During that time, we signed free trade agreements with Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Peru and Indonesia, as well as regional agreements across the Indo-Pacific, including the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus; the CPTPP, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership; and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Again, this is a wonderful legacy that the previous government has left the new government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also made two very important agreements just before the election. One was with the UK, and this is very exciting. The UK, historically, way back, used to be our biggest trading partner. It hasn't been for a while, obviously, with its relationship with the European Union. But the agreement that we've signed with it is exceptionally comprehensive, and we think it's going to be a very strong trading partner with us. Last week I had the enjoyment of meeting the UK trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, and she is looking forward to our trade relationship growing over the next few years. The other very important one that we signed is the economic cooperation and trade agreement with India. I know a lot of countries were surprised when we pulled that one off. It is another very exciting agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The onus is now on the new government. Those two agreements, the UK and India ones, haven't been brought into force yet. They need to go through committee work in our treaties committee. So the new government needs to get a move on with both of those. If they get those put in force before January, that means we'll get tariff reductions when they come into force, and we'll get another tariff reduction when 1 January comes around, because that's often when that kicks in. They have some work to do there. The one big one left, which we we're already working on, is a free trade agreement with the European Union. This is a test for the new government. They haven't got a good record, compared to us, with free trade agreements, so the EU is a big test for this new government. I certainly encourage them not to use New Zealand as a template for the agreement. New Zealand just made an agreement with the EU, and they gave up many concessions with geographic indicators—that is, you can't use geographical names in products. There's always a lot of grey area, too, around sanctions, or what that free trade agreement might mean for New Zealand if they don't meet certain international obligations. It is very important that the new government be very careful around those things. We expect a liberalised deal, a thorough deal, so it's a big challenge for the government. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  The pandemic has certainly shown us how important our trade relationships are. It has also, obviously, exposed some fundamental weaknesses. Those opposite presided over an increasingly difficult relationship with China, our largest trading partner, that had direct and painful consequences for Australian producers—of everything from wine to barley, cotton, coal and lobsters—many from the electorates of honourable members in the Chamber. It's clear that more could have been done over the previous decade to shield Australian exporters from this sort of pain. In fact, prior to the pandemic, the now Prime Minister, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, commissioned me to run an Indo-Pacific trade task force. We prepared a report looking at how we could best diversify our exports. He knew that we were too concentrated on one big market. We started our work in 2019 and watched up close as the 2020 trade shocks hit hard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's approach is to look at trade as a really important part of nation-building, to modernise the economy and, in turn, change Australian society for the better. I think we have seen that to some extent. However, I think Australia's trade position was weakened by having put too few eggs in too few baskets. Indeed, that was the title of our report. We looked into how we could have more eggs and more baskets. Unfortunately, under the previous Australian government, there was too much 'set and forget'. They turned up for the photo op and the announcements but then didn't do much afterwards. It's not as though it was not something that trade experts had warned us all about for years and years—particularly those non-tariff barriers. But what we ended up with was a narrowing export base of products—facing stiff market and non-market headwinds—concentrated in a handful of key markets. Worse than that, our resilience to trade shocks was eroded, given that excessive dependence on China. I think it was lazy, and it has cost us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, though, the new administration, under Anthony Albanese, has a plan. We've always believed in the power of trade to create jobs and economic development in Australia. We are the party of free, fair and open trade. We want to support our exporters to pursue new markets, because diversification, more eggs in more baskets, is the key. We've already seen a number of senior ministerial visits to major regional trading partners, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Japan, and a special focus on revitalising our relationship with India. We'll be establishing a Trade 2040 Taskforce. Recently, ministers for the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus met to discuss deepening trade cooperation in the Pacific, to support our Pacific family and their region's economic recovery. That group now includes Tuvalu and Vanuatu—important new members that Australia is committed to supporting as borders reopen and they re-engage in trade. This is obviously good not only for our international relationships but also for Aussie jobs, for local jobs. It is a fact that exporting businesses in Australia employ almost a third more staff than non-exporting businesses and, on average, pay 11 per cent higher wages—so good jobs in regional Australia paying higher wages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no doubt that we have inherited a massive trillion-dollar-debt and cost-of-living crisis, as inflation climbs and businesses struggle to attract workers. It's true that this is what we inherited from the former government. However, we're addressing this through putting in place the outcomes of the Jobs and Skills Summit, held a few days ago. Supporting both diversified and traditional relationships for trade is good for Australian businesses, it's good for Australian jobs, and it's good for Australian wages. Trade is a nation builder. And this government, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, will give it its due respect, but we'll do the work—the work that's required to grow our economy into the future.</span>

The member for Solomon has waxed lyrical about the ALP being the party of free trade. I recall that, back in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd heyday, in six years of government, they didn't land one free trade agreement. But here we go—I think you said you've got a plan to make a plan, which is great. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RICK WILSON:</span>
                  </a>  There's a task force to make the plan. That's terrific to hear! I'll give you some help here, member for Solomon. But, firstly, I just want to reiterate the comments of the member of Page about the extraordinary list of achievements of the previous government, and, in particular, our achievements in the field of trade. Of the 16 free trade agreements that this country currently has, 13 came into force under the coalition government. Since we came into office in 2013, the number of exporting businesses in this country has grown by almost 28 per cent, including over 56,000 small and medium-sized businesses. The jobs of one in five Australians are trade related, and on average those jobs are better paying than jobs in the general workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2013 and 2022 the coalition government implemented nine free trade agreements, lifting the share of trade covered by free trade agreements from 27 per cent in 2013 to over 70 per cent. And, when the current government finally gets around to ratifying the India and UK free trade agreements, that will lift to over 80 per cent, which is a magnificent achievement and certainly felt very strongly across my electorate of O'Connor, which is a very heavily trade orientated part of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on the Modern Manufacturing Strategy, where we saw investment by the Commonwealth government to support a whole range of industries. Most particularly, I want to touch on the critical minerals supply chain. Lynas corporation, which is an Australian ASX-listed company who were processing critical minerals in Malaysia, have made a decision to relocate their processing plant to Kalgoorlie and to process product from the Mount Weld mine at Laverton here in Australia, with some support through the Modern Manufacturing Strategy, and we are very proud to have been part of that process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on the UK FTA and its importance to Australian businesses, particularly agricultural businesses. Exporters will benefit from an immediate elimination of tariffs on over 99 per cent of goods exported to the UK, which is valued at about $9.2 billion, and farmers will have improved access to over 65 million UK consumers. For beef, that means that the current 12 per cent tariff will be immediately reduced, on a quota of 35,000 tonnes, and that quota will expand to 110,000 tonnes in year 10 of the agreement. This is why it is so critical that the government gets on with it and ratifies this agreement—because that will be effectively cumulative. If we can get this agreement ratified prior to 31 December then we get that quota increase on 1 January next year. And, of course, the increase is cumulative right through that 10-year period. So it's particularly important that the government get on with that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just touch on sheepmeat, which is particularly important in my electorate—and it's good to see the member for Fremantle has arrived in the Chamber. The quota of 25,000 tonnes which will be tariff free at entry will increase to 75,000 tonnes over 10 years. Once again, it's very important for the people of my electorate to get that agreement ratified and in place so that we get the benefits of those tariff-free quotas this year and then ongoing over the next 10 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few seconds, I want to touch on the India free trade agreement signed between then trade minister Dan Tehan and Minister Piyush Goyal. I met with Minister Goyal in Perth, with a delegation of farmers. It's very exciting, going forward, for Western Australia and Western Australian farmers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I'm very happy to contribute to this debate on the motion by the member for Page about Australia's approach to trade. Labor has always supported fair and free trade, because where trade is fair and unobstructed, with proper consideration given to social and environmental impacts, all countries can benefit. How they benefit and, more precisely, who benefits are questions with less clear answers. Certainly, there's evidence that, while trade liberalisation delivers aggregate economic growth, it can exacerbate inequality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without question, trade is complex, and it's not much good if our conversation about trade—or the conversation in the press or the wider community—is reduced to a fingerpainting version of the reality. The motion lists the number of trade agreements settled under the former government, and it cites the coverage of tariff-free access as a proportion of Australia's trade. That's all well and good—and, of course, Labor was supportive of the pursuit of these agreements—but it doesn't really go to the detail and quality of the coalition's effort when it comes to their management of Australia's trading relationships as a whole. Needless to say, trade agreements are not worth much where their details are ignored and are otherwise unenforceable, nor are trade agreements worth much when the absence of effective domestic trade facilitation means that Australian companies, especially small and medium enterprises, are not able to take advantage of the opportunities that they create.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, this motion doesn't acknowledge, for example, that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement has been virtually useless in preventing the geoeconomic coercion that we've experienced in recent years. It doesn't acknowledge that the PACER Plus agreement between Australia, New Zealand and a number of Pacific island nations was settled in a form that Papua New Guinea and Fiji, the two largest Pacific island economies, refused to sign. That was unfortunate. But it was in keeping with the former government's mismanagement of our relationship with Pacific island nations, and we've seen some of the consequences of that mismanagement. It doesn't acknowledge that the Morrison government was quite happy to see, under the first version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an extension of monopoly rights granted to American pharmaceutical companies in respect of biologic medicines that would likely have increased costs to the PBS by several hundred million dollars each and every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade agreements these days cover a much wider range of matters than just tariffs and market quotas. Indeed, they often involve concessions that are the very opposite of free trade, like the example that I've just given: extending monopoly rights to big pharmaceutical companies in the United States, to the detriment of our bottom line. Under the previous government, such concessions also included the preparedness to do away with labour market testing for some categories of temporary foreign workers, and the preparedness to do away with actual skills testing in critical areas like the electrical trades. The coalition government was also prepared to put at risk Australia's capacity to regulate in the best interests of the Australian community, by agreeing to allow large foreign companies to challenge our laws through questionable international tribunals under so-called ISDS provisions. We saw that occur, at a significant cost—millions and millions and millions of dollars, and years of delay—in relation to our laws for plain packaging of tobacco.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion, and some of the speakers to the motion, oddly call for the urgent ratification of the trade agreements that are under consideration—the Australia-United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement and the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement. I expect members know—they certainly should know—that those agreements are currently being considered in a proper and timely way by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It's an important matter of parliamentary process and good governance that the JSCOT inquiry, with its opportunity for submissions and public hearings, including from the National Farmers Federation and all sorts of different sectoral stakeholders, be allowed to occur without undue haste, let alone the presumption that it's some kind of rubber stamp. It is not. Those opposite should remember that, when the former coalition government was rushing headlong into an extradition treaty with China, it was the JSCOT—and, more specifically, Labor's dissenting report—that urged caution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth taking this opportunity to note that the JSCOT process with respect to trade agreements can and should be strengthened. That was the unanimous conclusion of the committee report tabled in the last parliament. It made five recommendations, including, crucially, calling for the independent analysis of the economic benefits and impacts of trade agreements and for a sensibly structured means by which key stakeholders—again, primary producers and others—can have better midstream access to the agreement negotiating process. As in many areas of life, trade agreement making is a question not just of quantity, as is referred to in the motion, but of quality. We're a trading nation in Australia. We're hugely dependent on trade, and our economic, social and environmental wellbeing will be shaped by how we participate in and influence the global trading system, but we should do so according to the principles of fair, sustainable and free trade, because it's in our national, economic, strategic, environmental and security interests to do so.</span>

                  <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  I thank the member for Page for this motion, and I fully support it. Trade is critical to regional prosperity and opportunity. In my electorate of Nicholls, we produce 90 per cent of Australia's pears and 48 per cent of the nation's apples. Dairy is a major industry, and we provide 24 per cent of the national production and 28 per cent of the national exports. The Goulburn Valley has a gross regional product of $6.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is down to agriculture. But that's only part of our story in Nicholls, a true food bowl not just for Australia but for the world. Our food-processing industry generates $2.5 billion annually.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few things that underpin our success and the export opportunities that we have. The critical one is water. We have a modernised and efficient irrigation network, and continued access to reliable water supply is essential. It's why we can't allow a further 450 gigalitres to be claimed for the environment without regard to the social and economic harm it will cause. We have innovative farmers and a reliable workforce, and we have a large and efficient freight and logistics industry that has grown alongside our agricultural output. Our location gives us access to major city markets and export routes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Nicholls understand the importance of agriculture and the value of exports, and they know the Nationals and the Liberals have always stood up for them by pursuing new markets and better terms of trade with the world. We have long led an ambitious trade agenda. Of Australia's 16 free trade agreements, 13 of them entered into force under coalition governments. We implemented nine free trade agreements in government, lifting the share of trade covered by the FTAs from 27 per cent in 2013 to over 70 per cent. That figure lifts to almost 80 per cent when you include the India and UK FTAs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's FTA with the UK is the most comprehensive and ambitious free trade agreement that Australia has, other than with New Zealand, and it was the first to be reached by the UK following its exit from the European Union. Labor couldn't even bring itself to acknowledge the FTA in its election trade policy and was slow to refer it to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is required as part of Australia's treaty-making process. As a member of that committee, I look forward to playing my role in progressing the FTA, which has widespread support, including from the National Farmers Federation, Seafood Industry Australia, Australian Meat Industry Council, Sheep Producers Australia, Alcohol Beverages Australia, Law Council of Australia, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Business Council of Australia and the Group of Eight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers will have improved access to more than 65 million UK consumers, who value safe, sustainably produced foods and beverages with the strong provenance that Australia—particularly my electorate of Nicholls—offers, whether that's fine wines from our great producers in Nicholls like Mitchelton, Tahbilk, Monichino, Tallis and Murchison Wines; our great dairy products; or Goulburn River Gold pears, to help APAL—Apple and Pear Australia Ltd—achieve its target of exporting 10 per cent of marketable production of apples and pears by 2027. Australia's trade agreement with India, negotiated and signed by the coalition government in April this year, opens a new era of growth for Australian exporters. It's an interim agreement, and the government has to remain ambitious and pursue a more comprehensive agreement once this one is ratified. Despite another regrettable delay, the agreement has also been referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for its review as required under Australia's processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunities for meat, wool, wine and fresh fruit and vegetables are enormous as tariffs reduce over time. Tariffs on almonds, lentils, oranges, mandarins, pears, apricots and strawberries will be reduced, improving opportunities for Australia's horticultural industry to supply India's growing food demand. The growers in Nicholls, some of the best in the world, are ready to step up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the coalition that initiated the FTA with the EU, seeking an ambitious and comprehensive deal to drive Australian exports, economic growth and job creation. The government must embrace that ambition, for it is not just the ambition of the Nationals and our Liberal friends; it is also the ambition of farmers, food processors and vignerons. Indeed, it is the ambition of regional communities who understand the prosperity, employment and success that strong trade policy delivers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I'm really delighted to speak on this motion today, to give an update on the fantastic work the Albanese Labor government is doing to progress free trade agreements in places like India, the UK and Europe. There is so much work going on to get these agreements back on track, after some fumbling by the previous government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our export industries on the New South Wales South Coast are hugely important. Our critical agricultural industries like dairy, beef and seafood, as well as wine, beverages, defence industry and manufacturing, rely heavily on exports to survive. We are also huge contributors to New South Wales's and Australia's export industry. We are very important economically. My electorate has the highest concentration of dairy cattle in New South Wales, and we have one of the oldest dairy industries in Australia. I come from a dairy farming family and I understand how important our exports are. Dairy exports, of course, are hugely important. Asia is the largest destination for Australian dairy, so a good working relationship with China is critical. That's why we're working on getting that relationship back on track. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also produce significant beef exports, as well as exporting seafood, like shellfish and more. For example, the new Moruya shellfish hatchery, supported with Australian government funding, will provide an export-accredited packing centre to meet overseas demand for shellfish, which can also be used by other food producers to value-add, pack and dispatch their produce. Eurobodalla Shire Council expects that the $4.8 million facility, which finished construction in June, will be operational by November. That's just fabulous and a great support for our shellfish farmers in the Eurobodalla.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Shoalhaven, the Shoalhaven Export Hub was launched at the end of 2020. Again, it was supported with an Australian government grant to help small and medium enterprises to grow, to export and to increase local and regional jobs. The hub is a network of businesses working together to harness opportunities in global markets and build skills and contacts for industry-wide local benefit. Just last week, I was speaking with a local defence industry manufacturer, Air Affairs, who told me that, before COVID, international exports accounted for 70 per cent of their business. That's absolutely huge. The Shoalhaven is one of the biggest contributors to New South Wales's manufacturing exports—around 30 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Manildra Group is a family-owned manufacturing business in Bomaderry. It was the first Australian company to export gluten to the UK, in the early 1970s. The Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement is critical to helping Manildra access the UK market. Without it, the tariffs and quotas imposed on most of its products are prohibitive. The agreement will help Manildra expand its opportunities, so I'm really proud of the work we're doing to progress the UK free trade agreement. The Albanese government is working to complete all the parliamentary and legal processes on the Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement as quickly as possible. Early entry into force of this agreement will allow Australian exporters to take full advantage of the tariff cuts it provides. The agreement will open up opportunities across the dairy and beef industries. It will help manufacturers like Manildra, and it will eliminate tariffs on Australian wine, which by value is Australia's largest dutiable export to the UK. It will also enhance pathways for workers and young people to work in both countries—something I know our seasonal growers will also be happy about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are looking to advance the parliamentary process for the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, an interim agreement, while also resuming negotiations for a full, comprehensive economic cooperation agreement. The trade minister met with India's Minister of Commerce and Industry in June and committed to rapidly recommence negotiations on the full agreement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are restarting negotiations with the Europeans to get a good outcome on the EU free trade agreement. The Prime Minister brought these negotiations back on track during his June visit to Europe, and the next round of negotiations will start on 17 October. Ultimately, our negotiations with the EU will be concluded only when we have a good deal that is in our national interest and delivers commercially-significant new market access for our agricultural products. That will be good news for local farmers. Australian industry and consumers can be confident that we will drive a hard bargain, as we always do, to achieve an overall agreement of benefit to Australia. Our government is committed to securing Australia's global competitiveness in trade.</span>

It was an absolute privilege to be invited to speak at this assembly and provide the students with insight into my time as an emergency doctor working at both Gosford and Wyong hospitals, but also into my First Nations background. The students were keen to share with me their thoughts on how the new federal government can make Australia a more inclusive and equal country for all Australians.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  As we meet today, a humanitarian crisis is hitting Pakistan. Monsoon rains have surged well above normal levels, producing devastating floods which have left one-third of the country under water. Tens of millions of people have been displaced, many more lack access to safe drinking water, and at least 1,000 people have been killed so far, including 400 children. We are likely to see an imminent outbreak of waterborne diseases such as cholera and also an outbreak of malaria.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pakistani Minister for Climate Change, Sherry Rehman, has called these floods a man-made disaster. I agree. These are a result of human action. So we need urgent action to reduce our emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change. Like Pakistan, Australia's highly exposed to climate change, as the fires and floods of recent years have shown. We need to urgently invest in preparedness and mitigation before it's too late. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Hawkesbury businesses that are still struggling to recover from the most recent floods have been left high and dry by the New South Wales government. A program that provides a $10,000 business grant to businesses who didn't themselves get water through the doors but nonetheless suffered a 40 per cent drop in revenue has been expanded to areas like the Kangaroo Valley. That's the right thing to do. But the New South Wales government has declined to include the Hawkesbury on this list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the New South Wales Premier visited South Windsor in July, I personally raised the need for assistance for businesses indirectly affected by the floods. I provided them with a number of case studies. They've ignored this. This is joint Commonwealth-state funding delivered through the New South Wales government, but it needs the New South Wales government to nominate an area. The funding helps small business operators recover from having the doors closed because they or their staff couldn't get to work or because the customers weren't able to reach them or they couldn't reach their customers, and it helps them to recover from the prolonged slump that happens after a flood. Not every business will be eligible, but every area that's had a natural disaster should be eligible. New South Wales should not pit one flood-impacted community against another. This is an issue of fairness. If a business in the Hawkesbury has suffered the same impact as a business in another flooded community, they should be treated equally. It should not depend on your postcode.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Imagine if you have a specialist appointment about your knees. They are really making it difficult to get up and down the stairs and you can no longer walk long distances. You can no longer drive. You call your local community transport service well in advance. But, because of Commonwealth funding cuts and exploding operating costs, the hospital shuttles can't take you, and a taxi is too expensive. What do you do?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Easylink is a not-for-profit community organisation that has served Mackellar's elderly and differently abled people since 1982, providing them with affordable transport so they can live full lives and attend important appointments. Easylink averages 50,000 trips per year. One hundred committed volunteers and staff conduct the trips. Peter Deshon from the Northern Beaches gave the service a five-star rating and said that staff were friendly and helpful and that the service was awesome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this service, which many in our community depend upon, is at risk. Employment costs are going up. Fuel costs have increased by 80 per cent and insurance costs by 11.5 per cent. At the same time, Commonwealth funding has dropped by six per cent. The future is also uncertain with the design of the new Support at Home scheme proposed by the government. If it is not designed right, it could impact community transport services. This is an opportunity to design a program that helps our most vulnerable. Let's re-fund this service so it can continue its great work.</span>

We are way bigger than many other electorates, from Tasmania to Western Australia et cetera. Names like Gregory Hills, Arcadian Hills, Willowdale and Oran Park may mean nothing to you, but they are new suburbs on the south-western outskirts of Sydney. Unfortunately, most of those suburbs cannot access health care. We have a dire shortage of general practitioners. The previous government has done absolutely nothing to deal with that. Many of the people in my electorate, particularly those with young families, don't have a named GP—they go to their local hospitals in Camden, Campbelltown and Liverpool to access medical care. This is putting enormous pressure on our health system, and it's time for something to be done. This government will do something about it, but it requires innovative solutions. It requires a lot of effort into our major teaching hospitals, providing expertise to try to improve access to primary care. It needs everyone working to their highest scope of practice. We need to change the system. It is not working for people in my electorate, and we must change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  The harmonisation of abortion laws across Australia is overdue. As a first step, revision of Medicare numbers would enable better access and better data on terminations. Western Australian women are subject to some of the most restrictive laws in the country. In some circumstances, they need to travel thousands of kilometres to access abortion. They're uprooted, alone and financially disadvantaged when at their most vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, abortion is still in the Criminal Code, and there's limited access to terminations through the public health system. The choice to have a termination after 20 weeks doesn't belong to the pregnant woman and her healthcare provider but rather to an ethics panel of six people appointed by the health minister. A doctor living in my electorate gave me some examples of the impact of this issue on women's lives. Fiona had serious mental health problems and was living in a violent relationship with a partner who prevented her from having an earlier termination. She was denied a termination by the panel and couldn't travel because of COVID. She had the baby and continued to be trapped in that relationship. Alina had eclampsia at 22 weeks and was having uncontrolled seizures. Termination of her pregnancy was delayed while applying to the panel, placing her life at risk. Anh's baby was diagnosed with a significant genetic disorder, but the ethics panel decided she was not permitted to discontinue the pregnancy. She then had to travel to Victoria for the procedure. The federal government has a responsibility to ensure all Australian women have equal access to safe abortion care.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  Last week I attended the book launch of <span style="font-style:italic;">Action Sweet</span><span style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ater Creek</span>. The author, Warwick Exton, turns 100 years old in November and is a bit of a living legend in my community. He has been in Frankston South for 60 years. He has lived a richly challenging life, studying commerce at Melbourne university, defending Australia during World War II and working for 20 years with General Motors Holden. He has also devoted many years of his life to the restoration of the Sweetwater Creek Nature Reserve The trail is named after him—Exton Walk. He is described by those who know him as an inspiration, an educator, a true friend and an irresistible force. Apparently, reluctant teenagers sent by their school for an environmental experience will find themselves firmly involved by a stocky, silver-haired gentleman and his enthusiasm.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This book was a labour of love for Warwick, and it is a testament to all of the volunteer hours that have gone into the restoration of Sweetwater Creek in Frankston South for more than 30 years now. It's a collective vision of locals to turn a desolate area into an environmental wonderland, and this book and the creek are part of Warwick's legacy to my community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to Councillor Alison Goode, the inaugural mayor of the City of Albany, who passed away last week. In the late 1990s the rural shire of Albany merged with the historic town it surrounded to become the most populous city in my electorate. Alison, who had been deputy president of the shire, was one of seven candidates who ran to become the mayor of the city. She won that election, and the next one. When she left this world on Wednesday, she was still a serving city councillor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I was privileged to share a meal with Alison and her husband, Gerry Gregson. We caught up at the Redmond hall, a vibrant community hub in the rural West Ward that Alison had served so diligently. We swapped stories well into the night about the trials, tribulations, triumphs and tricks of local and federal politics. Councillor Goode and I were proud that night to open a new kitchen facility at the hall that had been built with financial assistance from both the Commonwealth and the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alison worked hard to represent her constituents right up until the end. My condolences go to Gerry and all of the family. The City of Albany will only ever have one inaugural mayor, and we were very lucky that it was Alison Goode. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Last week I attended CRC in St Albans for a chat and a grilling by some of the student leaders. I was struck by the story of one of the student leaders. He was born in Iraq, and he and his family spent four years in a refugee camp in Jordan before being granted visas. He came to Australia without a word of English, but in four short years he has already made a mark, like so many migrants before him. He is now the year 9 social justice captain. He is studying maths and science, aspires to become a police officer and will no doubt continue to contribute to this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the way back to the office, I stopped at the local shopping strip to buy banh mis for the office, which has become a weekly tradition. As we tucked into the delicious lunch, I was reminded yet again of the enormous contribution of migrants and how they have enriched the lives of all of us. This is part of the reason why I welcome the increase in the ceiling of the permanent migration program to 195,000—a belated recognition of the skills shortage we face but also a return to the days in which this country valued permanent migration—extending visas; putting more money into visa processing; and relaxing work restrictions on international students. This country has a very long and storied history, with massive contributions from the migrants who have come here from all parts of the world, and I saw it that day in the student leaders who I met.</span>

The show was opened by the newly decorated Commonwealth marathon gold medallist, Jess Stenson, and it was wonderful to have her in Crystal Brook on the day. The weather was a little inclement; it was cold, it was wintery, but mostly we dodged the showers. It was wonderful to see more than 3½ thousand people roll up after, basically, a three-year absence of the show.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee, led by Alexandra Dewar, have done a wonderful job with the volunteers. It's not easy to crank everything up after that period of time. When they got to the pavilion they found it had been white-anted out, so they had to abandon the old pavilion and relocate all of the general interest items to the stadium alongside it, which led to other changes happening at the show. But they took it all in their stride and got the whole act together. On the day they announced that we have a new Crystal Brook young rural ambassador, Lachie Hansen. So, well done, Lachie. It's a great pathway that he is embarking upon at the moment.</span>

One resident emphatically told me that to say that Dr Latt is worth his weight in gold is an understatement, and I could not agree more. Thank you, Dr Latt, for your service.</span>

It's a crime for a member of parliament to talk about a policy and a platform that were put in place six years ago? All of a sudden, we can't have a discussion about it? We can't say that that may have been the case at that time? All I said was, 'When things change, we should change.' What a terrible indictment of the Australian community when I say, 'When things change, we should change'! We should change and have a look at the policies that we have, because we've got such limited time. Facts do change. Times change. Things need to change. If you don't like my view to cut out the whole of the third tranche of the policy, that's fine. Why can't we tweak it? I want to acknowledge, firstly, that, yes, 20 per cent of high-income taxpayers pay 80 per cent of the tax. I want to acknowledge that; that's reasonable. But all I've asked for in my process, in my discussions, with all of you is: 'Let's have a discussion about tax policy, and let's have a reasonable discussion about tax policy.' Those, like me, on high incomes, I said, don't need a tax cut. It's true; we don't need a tax cut. No-one's calling out for me to have a tax cut, but, if you find someone, get them to give me a call.</span>

The 2022 campaign promotes 'A global village, doing local good,' highlighting all the immeasurable benefits that both members and communities gain from these places of connection.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first want to acknowledge Peter Bettes, who's not doing too well at the moment. He's got a serious health issue that's not looking good, but Peter has been instrumental in bringing together the states and the national Men's Shed Association. He should be acknowledged for that great work, because there's been a lot of politics played, but he's been a shining light. I just want to thank him for that, particularly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men's sheds, no matter where you go across the electorate, are putting in hours and hours delivering great good, and it's great that I could again co-chair the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Sheds. In the first day, we had 51 responses from people wanting to come in, because members know that men's sheds are vitally important for men's health and for community growth through the great work they do in bringing communities together. I think about one area, Lancefield, where they bring all the schoolkids in and teach them basic woodwork. That not only teaches these kids valuable skills but breaks down the barrier between older men who are out in the street and the kids. They're able to go up and talk to each other and say hello and work together. Men's sheds are so important. Every MP should be involved in this movement. The time for us to celebrate this might be only one week, but we should be celebrating the work that men's sheds do each and every week of the year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  September is Rural Road Safety Month, an initiative of the Australian Road Safety Foundation. It's a chance to stop and reflect on road safety and what we can do to make our rural roads safer. Seven hundred and thirty lives were lost on rural roads last year, representing two-thirds of all Australian road deaths. As someone who drives more than 100,000 kilometres a year on rural roads and who lives in a close-knit regional community, I understand the importance of rural road safety and the importance of reducing risk. I'm committed to ensuring all levels of government maintain and improve our regional road network and improve safety, including by rolling out committed coalition investments through programs like the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, Roads to Recovery, the Black Spot Program, the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program and the Bridges Renewal Program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with government funding to improve our roads, we can all do our bit to make our roads safer. Driving to the conditions, taking rest breaks, avoiding distraction, keeping our vehicles maintained and taking note of ANCAP and used-car safety ratings are all steps Australians can take to keep themselves and their loved ones safe on our national regional road network. I urge all road users to be the change you want to see, because, after all, the keys to road safety are in all of our hands.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Today I rise to talk about a wonderful initiative in Boothby: the City of Mitcham's Community Renewable Energy Program. As part of its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the City of Mitcham partnered with renewable energy supplier ShineHub to provide residents with bulk-buyer discounts on solar panels and battery technologies. The process enables residents to buy solar panels and batteries at a discounted rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to report that, since expressions of interest opened in May this year, the council has received a staggering 2,000-plus registrations of interest from the community, and, from that, 535 solar batteries have been ordered. That's 535 additional batteries in the city of Mitcham alone, driving our transition to renewable energy. Even better, all 535 households who have ordered these batteries have also signed up to be part of a virtual power plant. This virtual power plant aggregates the power stored by these batteries to provide stability to the electricity grid. In fact, the latest report suggests that the virtual power plant created by this project equates to 2.5 megawatts of dispatchable load, working to increase supply and reliability and ultimately reduce costs for residents who are part of this program. This is just one example of the enthusiasm with which Boothby residents are taking up renewables when they're available, and I really commend the City of Mitcham for their leadership in this program.</span>

We were in the butter section, and she couldn't make up her mind about which butter to buy, because of the cost of butter. We had a discussion about how much everything's going up. When people are standing there and they can't buy the butter they usually buy, we really do have a problem. Cost of living is impacting everyone in my community, from Emu Heights to Colyton. When it is such a difficult choice about what you'll feed your family that night or the ability to put petrol in your car or—if you're running a small business—being able to keep the lights on and keep your employees employed, things are not going right.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had many constituents reach out to me in recent months about the pressures they're feeling with soaring prices across the board for everyday items. One manufacturer in Penrith told me its energy prices have gone up 300 per cent. This manufacturer is under threat of closing. It employs hundreds of people, including people in my electorate of Lindsay. The Labor government must consider electorates like mine in Western Sydney and support Australians who are doing it tough right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak in support of this motion. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's July 2022 interim report on its gas inquiry confirms the east coast energy crisis is likely to last beyond the winter of 2023. This is extremely concerning for Australian businesses and households alike. A forecasted 70 per cent increase in gas demand for electricity generation and high international gas prices mean that both electricity and gas prices on the east coast of Australia are likely to remain elevated for at least the next 12 months. While I don't think we can assign blame to the Labor government for a surge in international gas prices, it is the government's responsibility to come up with a plan to address this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the plan? The responses from the ministers responsible have been abysmal so far. The resources minister, Madeleine King, managed to say that she was commissioning a discussion paper and promised to set in motion the process of triggering the Australian domestic gas security mechanism. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been missing in action. He doesn't support bringing on new gas supply. It would jeopardise his chances of more deals with the Greens on climate legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia simply needs more energy. The best long-term fix to disconnect domestic gas prices from high global prices is more supply. The coalition had a plan in government to unlock new supply to keep prices low and the lights on. Our record on energy and emissions speaks for itself. We saw record installations of renewable energy over the past three years. We committed to net zero and put in place the Technology Investment Roadmap to guide investment of $22 billion in new energy technologies. We saw the results. Under the coalition, electricity prices fell eight per cent for households, 10 per cent for small businesses and 12 per cent for industry. We meet and beat our targets without legislating them. We beat our 2020 targets by more than 459 million tonnes, and we were on track to meet and beat our 2030 target. Last year, Australia's emissions were more than 20 per cent below 2005 levels, while our economy had grown by 45 per cent over the same period. The coalition's strategic basin plans and the National Gas Infrastructure Plan were also backed by more than $300 million of funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must put aside politics and support projects like the Beetaloo Strategic Basin Plan, which was introduced by the coalition. We also committed billions of dollars to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, also known as the NAIF, which was being used to support the development of new gas supply projects. It is uncertain whether the new Labor government will support the NAIF with continued funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia must have a long-term plan for efficient and reliable energy. This is one of the key issues that are raised with me as the shadow assistant minister for manufacturing, and the cost of energy is seen as the key handbrake on prosperity for many manufacturing businesses. Short-sighted bans on developing unconventional onshore gas are coming home to roost. The Labor government's dithering and navel-gazing are sending businesses to the wall, and households are choosing between heating and eating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It didn't take the Albanese Labor government very long to break one of its central election promises: to cut household power bills by $275 by 2025. I remember seeing signage on election day that said they were going to deliver this $275 saving. They've been in government for well over 100 days, and no attempt has been made to deliver on this commitment. When they're asked questions about when they'll be providing this cost saving to Australian households, all they do is dodge the subject. The Labor government continues to treat Australians like mugs and is unwilling to talk about alternative energy sources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is faced with an energy crisis, and this side of the Chamber is not afraid to ask questions and find solutions that will keep the lights on and save Australians from increasing cost pressures. That's why the coalition is willing to have a sensible and respectful conversation about nuclear energy. The formation of a coalition policy committee to explore the introduction of nuclear into Australia's energy mix was a clear indicator of the coalition's willingness to listen and learn, for the interests of all Australians. We have driven the need for this debate to happen, and the formation of the policy committee is a clear victory for common sense. It's disappointing the Prime Minister is unwilling to even have a discussion with the opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and member for Maranoa offered the opportunity for the Prime Minister to lead a national conversation on a nuclear energy. He wrote to the Prime Minister on 8 June 2022, calling for a national energy summit. The Prime Minister has rejected the deputy opposition leader's request and shown that the Labor government is not interested in exploring all possible future energy sources. We need a permanent solution to the energy crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I would like to commend the Prime Minister, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy and the Minister for Resources for ensuring Australia positions itself as an energy powerhouse by supporting and accelerating renewable energy projects across Australia and ensuring we are harnessing new technologies to power Australia's energy demands. Not only is the government embracing renewable energy; the government is also taking urgent and responsible action to address domestic gas supplies now and into the future. In August of this year the Minister for Resources announced that consultations with the public and industry had concluded and that, following these discussions, the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, or ADGSM, would be extended to 2030. The mechanism was due to expire on 1 January of next year. We now have an important safeguard that can be implemented in the situation where our domestic gas supplies are forecast to not meet the demands of the nation. It is imperative to note that the minister is provided the most up-to-date advice from the Australian Energy Market Operator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, industry and other government sources before making any decision on utilising the ADGSM.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government came into office in May with a comprehensive climate and energy policy. We are now building on this, with all jurisdictions, to deliver much-needed long-term certainty to industry and investors. Business, industry and investors are all saying the same thing: domestically we need to upgrade the transmission grid and inject more into renewables. The government agree, and we're all in. It's absolutely staggering that the opposition has the audacity to ask us about energy and gas, when they spent a decade in government and all they left us with was division, denial and no coherent energy policy. Australians saw a decade of mismanagement of energy policy under the former Liberal government. This has cost us jobs. It has cost us growth and opportunities in the renewable energy sector. I'm pleased to be part of a government that are now demonstrating to the world that we are once again a nation looking towards the future and embracing the renewable energy opportunities that will come from addressing our energy supply issues and by acting on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An important step the Albanese government is taking to ensure Australians have access to reliable, cheap energy into the future is upgrading our electricity network so that it reflects the energy sources that are feeding electricity into it. As more renewable energy becomes available, our energy network needs to be able to distribute this energy more efficiently. By investing in our electricity grid and by fixing energy transmission, the government will achieve this objective and drive down energy prices for Australians. For example, in my electorate of Robertson I am pleased that we will benefit from one of many new community batteries that will be rolled out across Australia. These community batteries will harness solar power from the rooftops of nearby residents and have this energy stored, to be used at night. These community batteries are one component of a much larger Powering Australia policy which will ensure Australia is diversifying our energy sources, reducing our emissions and making energy cheaper for more Australians. I can also report that, in Narara, where the new battery will be placed, there is already a strong interest in how residents can get involved. Similarly, across many of the suburbs in my electorate, there are calls for more community batteries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are keen to embrace renewable energy and storage technology that will ensure reliable energy around the clock and help meet our emissions reduction targets. The Albanese government is also making sure that more Australians can realise the benefits of solar and is committed to establishing 85 solar banks throughout the country. Australians voted for a government that will invest in renewable energy, and that is exactly what the Albanese Labor government is doing. Again, I commend the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese; the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen; and Minister King for being responsible and ensuring Australia continues to have reliable and affordable energy but also for being future focused about the energy needs of our nation and of all Australians. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I rise today in support of the member for Durack's motion and to thank the member for giving me the opportunity to address this important issue. The people of my electorate of Dawson have grave concerns about the rising costs of living, especially rising energy costs. The recent ACCC gas inquiry report, released in July 2022, forecasts that the demand for gas for electricity generation will grow by 70 per cent next year and that gas supplies remain tight. In the 2022-23 budget, the coalition committed $50.3 million to accelerate priority gas infrastructure. This included funding for early works support to help accelerate seven priority gas infrastructure projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our side understands that gas is a critical enabler of Australia's economy. Gas provides fuel that allows power to be generated 24/7, not just when the sun is shining or when the wind blows. Gas-fired power stations can be ramped up and wound down and can be used to balance the record levels of increased supply from solar and wind. As I said in my maiden speech, I am a supporter of all energy options, whether coal or gas fired, hydro, solar, wind or nuclear. We need to provide power to businesses and households that is reliable and affordable in the best way that we can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It blows my mind that, after over 100 days in government, Labor still have no plan to support families and businesses struggling with skyrocketing power prices. Instead of reminding gas suppliers of their obligation to domestic gas users, the energy minister can't even tell the Australian people whether he supports the new gas supply. The coalition has a fully costed national gas infrastructure plan to invest in new gas pipelines and support the development of new gas projects. The energy minister has called the plan BS and a fraud. But I would like to remind the House that the Labor Party repeatedly told the Australian people, particularly the voters in Central and North Queensland and the good folks in my electorate of Dawson whose jobs rely on gas and coal, that they would not do deals with the Greens. But, since coming to government, we have seen the energy minister caving to Green demands on their Climate Change Bill and failing to commit to a position on new gas projects. Labor have even promised 97 times since December 2021 that, if elected, they would reduce Australian household power bills by $275—that's $275—and all we're hearing now is crickets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families and businesses are struggling with soaring power prices and mounting cost-of-living pressures. Everyone on our side of the House knows the answer to reducing higher prices, and that is to bring in more supply. But it just seems that the anti-gas, anti-coal, anti-regions, anti-small-business, anti-ag and anti-commitment Labor government cannot bring themselves to displease the Greens. So it will be all Australian families and small businesses that will continue to suffer and live in fear of these rising costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Dawson are not fools. They know that this government does not have their best interests at heart. The government needs to honour its election commitment to cut power prices, as promised, and provide a plan to respond to the east coast energy crisis, without further dithering and without further delays.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  As the member for Paterson, energy is my business. No electorate knows better than mine that it is vital that we continue to power our industry, that we continue not only to allow people to put on the aircon on 44 degree days but also to support industry and, more importantly, investment in energy. And that's really been the problem over the last 10 years. We just haven't had the level of investment in energy that is required. The former government turned its back on it, turned its back on the opportunity that was coming down the line when we had a chance to really grasp it—and it was a nettle, but we had the chance to grasp it—and say, 'No; Australia can be better.' The former government didn't do it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomago Aluminium sits in my seat and it uses 12 per cent of the energy in New South Wales. It employs a thousand people directly and 5,000 indirectly. But, more than that, it acts as a battery for New South Wales. When there is a situation in New South Wales where we do have a drain on energy, Tomago gets the phone call. It gets asked to curtail production. In that way, we can keep the hospitals running, keep the industry going and keep the aircon on across New South Wales and the eastern seaboard of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be a strong voice for industry and energy in this place and even prouder to be part of a government that knows Australia can be better and that it can be an energy powerhouse. It is such a relief that, after a decade of denial and a decade of delay from the former government, we are in charge and we're, quite frankly, taking care of energy business. We understand that gas plays an important part in the energy mix in powering communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas is critical to our transition for industries and manufacturers. In my home town the Kurri Kurri gas plant is currently being constructed, ensuring that supply is continuous and reliable. It is necessary and it does look to the future, with hydro and hydrogen coming in future years. I do take a moment to thank my friend Paul Broad for his contribution at Snowy Hydro and beyond, and for his advice and counsel over my tenure in the energy sector as the member for Paterson. I acknowledge the former minister's endorsement of that and thank him very much for that. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government came to office in May with a comprehensive climate and energy policy, and Australians supported us. That's the long and the short of it. Australians want reliable energy and they want cheaper power. But, more importantly than that, they want to maintain our standard of living, they want to keep their jobs, and they want to be able to service their mortgages and send their kids to school and have a good life. They know, as part of that, it is vitally important that every industry has access to reliable and, most importantly, affordable energy. And they know that good policy will drive prices down. It will provide certainty for that investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come into office with a comprehensive plan. We want to rewire the grid. We know the grid doesn't stack up at the moment. It was built for 1980s centralised power. More and more across the country, people are embracing renewables. We know that it is a very divested grid now. We know that the energy landscape across Australia is different. We have to have a grid that can cope with that. We also have to have policies that encourage investment in energy but that also encourage the businesses that are actually going to drive the innovation to keep making things, keep employing people and keep the lights on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be interesting, as we emerge in the next 10 to15 years as this superpower, to look back on this time and remember the comments made by those opposite and to see how, really, they have not only delayed and denied but also talked our country down at a time when we need to be talking it up as much as we can.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  It's always a pleasure to follow the member for Paterson—one of the few on that side who is relatively sensible, I've got to say. I rise to support the motion. There are some fundamentals around gas in Australia, there are facts around gas in Australia, there are deliverables around gas in Australia and then there are the premiers and their decisions around gas in Australia. We have only to look at Victoria to know why there is such a challenge in Victoria and such a shortfall in gas; it's because they've had a moratorium on exploration. If you do not explore for more gas, you will eventually run out. These are the fundamental propositions of how it works. You have a resource which has a finite life which will eventually run out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bass Strait has been a great boon for Australia and it has been an incredible boon for Victoria, particularly for Victorian manufacturing, because it has meant not only the availability of oil to go into Australian refineries but also the availability of cheap gas that is geographically located very close to demand, which has built up in Victoria over a long period of time. Bass Strait is now coming to the end of its available life in terms of its deliverables. There's still some more that can be milked out of the Bass Strait, and there are a number of companies out there looking at those opportunities which will add on to gas in Victoria. But the fundamental concept being put forward by those opposite and others—that you can take gas from 2,000 kilometres away, at the Gladstone export hub, and put it into Victoria and still have the same price as when you were taking it from Bass Strait just down the road—is completely flawed. It cannot be done. It is physics. If you have to transfer gas, whether that's via a pipeline or via other mechanisms, it adds costs. This is very, very basic economics. It adds costs. I say to those Victorian manufacturers that utilise gas: if you do not get the state government on board to deliver and develop more of your own resource, you are going to have challenges into the future because, quite simply, you cannot supply into the future at the same rate and at the same price as you've seen out of Bass Strait and elsewhere for so many decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not a shortage of gas in this country; there is gas everywhere. In fact, we are one of the highest exporters of gas in the world. We have great demand for Australia's resources, but we have issues around where it is geographically located. We in the previous government worked very hard to deliver things like the Beetaloo Basin—one of the biggest gas plays on the planet right now. What did we strike? We didn't strike resistance; we struck opposition from those who were then in opposition. They couldn't even bring themselves to vote against a motion in the Senate looking to stop the work that we were doing to bring this gas on earlier, because we knew there would be demand. So for those opposite to stand up and say that it is all the coalition's fault is purely wrong. It is complete nonsense. We have looked to deliver gas in the Beetaloo. In fact I, as minister, signed off on any number of projects and exploration permits in offshore, as is the responsibility of the minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to give credit where it's due. At the moment, Minister King is making good decisions for the country around the resources sector, and you need to maintain that stability. What we've seen in places like Queensland is the Labor state government making decisions on royalties without consultation, imposing them straight up on industry and taking billions of extra dollars. That affects a company's ability to make decisions, including final investment decisions, and it affects their ability to make long-term planning strategies around where they will put capital, because capital will move. In fact, I had a discussion with a number of individuals this morning from the sector. They are looking at South America because it is more stable and because they have fewer issues around changes with regulation and with taxes and royalties. For onshore coal in Queensland, we now see one of the highest royalty rates and taxes in the world. Who pays that price? Well, it is regional Queensland, because those new projects will be in those locations, and that's where those jobs will be, and that's who'll pay the bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear about bills all the time, but what we don't hear about from those opposite anymore is the $275 reduction that they promised at the last election for the Australian people. Yet we continue to see electricity prices increase. The reason for that is pretty straightforward: we're not generating enough capacity to meet demand. When there is a shortfall, it drives up the wholesale price, which drives up the retail price for consumers. I say to those opposite that one of the most important things that need to be done is to keep the lights on. If we cannot provide reliable, affordable energy in this country, whether it's through gas or electricity, then manufacturing will leave, and we need to maintain that manufacturing base. It is critical for our national security, and it is in our national interest to maintain it. I'd suggest they get on with doing just that.</span>

It's ironic that the opposition has the gall to criticise this side about energy and gas. When you look at the past 10 years, the last decade, you see that they've spent a decade in government and all they left was division, denial and no coherent energy policy. In fact, we saw 22 failed policies that got us nowhere. The lack of any policy framework stifled investment and slowed the uptake of renewables. Why would you want to invest if there is no solid policy framework? After 22 failed policies, no-one would want to invest in this area. We could have been in a much better position to deal with this crisis today had the government dealt with it in a way that was coherent and that had a framework. But no—22 policies and division on their side in this area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've been left vulnerable and more exposed to high global gas and coal prices. The previous government knew that electricity prices were skyrocketing. The former energy minister, who is now the shadow Treasurer, even ordered that the information be hidden from the Australian people. In fact, the previous government knew that energy prices would be going up on 1 July 2022 and hid that information from the voters until after the election. So it seems a bit rich that the opposition now choose to be indignant about something that they not only contributed to and created but also hid from the Australian public. A decade of denial and a decade of climate wars—this is what the previous government left us with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best way to reduce energy costs is to increase the use of renewables. The science is unanimous about that. Instead of taking action, the previous government did nothing but quote the same line over and over again. That line was, 'The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow.' How many times did we hear that from the then government? Too many times, and it was just blatant scare tactics, because we know that renewable energy is the future of this nation and, in fact, the future of our earth. We know that it's the best way to ensure investment in renewables, and it's consistent and reliable policy-setting that will do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen that in my own home state of South Australia. At the end of last year, South Australia sourced an average of over 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable power for 6½ days straight. This is a record for South Australia, and it's likely a record for all comparable grids around the world. This is thanks to my state's clear and constant—and bipartisan, I must say—commitment to renewables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy prices will be cheaper under our policies, but we know it's not going to happen overnight, especially considering the inaction of the past decade. Our Powering Australia plan will drive investment in more low-cost firmed renewables, and it's estimated to bring on 82 per cent renewables by 2030. We will put downward pressure on power prices by getting more of the cheapest form of energy—firmed renewables—into the energy market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want to unlock our world-class offshore wind energy potential. We will be commencing consultation on six proposed regions with significant potential. Just one rotation of one offshore wind turbine provides as much energy as the average rooftop solar installation generates in one day. We are absolutely committed to renewables. We understand that this is vital to tackle climate change, but it's also vital for our economy and energy market. Compare that to the former government. Who could forget the assertion that electric vehicles will end the weekend? That is what we were hearing. Who could forget the 22 failed energy policies? Who could forget the decade of inaction? Who could forget the billions wasted with nothing to show for it? Australians deserve a government that will protect their future, and this is a job that we take extremely seriously.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The damaged and declining state of Australia's environment is not going to be addressed by an exercise in collective amnesia.

Why was it hidden? Because it tells a story of harm and damage and neglect. It tells a story about the consequences of inaction and incompetence. For nine years we had a coalition government that did not believe the health of our environment was a priority. They rolled five separate ministers through the portfolio and cut funding to the department by 40 per cent, and then they hid the truth about the consequences of their neglect. The truth is a story of significant harm, with a trajectory, sadly, of further decline.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In describing a report in an address to the National Press Club, the Minister for the Environment and Water rightly said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">But while it's a confronting read, Australians deserve the truth. We deserve to know that Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. We deserve to know that threatened communities have grown by 20 per cent in the past five years, with places literally burned into endangerment by catastrophic fires.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the report itself says: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the state and trend of the environment of Australia are poor and deteriorating as a result of increasing pressures from climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and resource extraction.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless we are reconciled to the further degradation of our environment and its biodiversity, we have to change our approach. Our national environmental protection framework—the EPBC Act—has been ineffective as a shield against that harm. That is the conclusion of Professor Graeme Samuel, the reviewer appointed by the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been clear in saying that we will undertake the necessary reform that the previous government failed to undertake. If we are not prepared to do things differently then only one thing is for sure: more and more unique species will disappear, and more and more distinctive Australian ecosystems will collapse. There simply has to be an uncompromising element to environmental protection in future. There has to be a hard-eyed capacity to see cumulative impacts and to draw some lines in the sand around the protection of threatened species and ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how and where the harm is occurring. The question is: what are we going to do about it? I say this to colleagues in the parliament as much as to the broader Australian community: we cannot go on like this and at the same time kid ourselves that our biodiversity can be maintained. We cannot have a regulatory approach that essentially condones the steady degradation of the Australian environment. We can't keep finding ways to conditionally approve forms of harm that in some cases are not acceptable, especially where conditions are not monitored and not met. And we can't, as a matter of habit, use offsets to fix projects that put threatened species or ecosystems at risk, when those offsets aren't properly recorded or audited and in effect allow a net loss of critical habitat. We can't subscribe to the view that any and every form of environmental impact can be approved, provided there is sufficient economic benefit. And, as I've said before, we can't fool ourselves with the concept of striking a balance, when the reality has been a profound imbalance against nature for a considerable time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do is change—and we can change. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the environment</span> report itself says:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Immediate action with innovative management and collaboration can turn things around. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as we look to creating the long-absent First Nations voice in our system of decision-making, the report notes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Respectful use of Indigenous knowledge, recognition of Indigenous knowledge rights, and Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge systems working together will lead to positive change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us be both resolute and energised as we face up to the task at hand. There are lots of examples of ordinary citizens and activists and scientists and public servants and Indigenous rangers putting their heart and soul into environmental conservation and restoration. Things are not good—but we can do something about it. It requires us in this place to do our job, to be the stewards of this remarkable continent and its oceans. It doesn't mean zero projects or zero clearing or zero impact, but it does mean supporting the reforms and resources that are necessary to stop the further decline in Australia's environment. The minister for the environment was absolutely right when she said:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  I second the motion. I thank the member for Fremantle for moving this important motion regarding the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia state of the environment</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2021</span> report. Having been on the Environment and Energy Committee with the member for Fremantle in the last parliament, I know his passion for the environment is incredibly strong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report's 'Key findings' begins:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the state and trend of the environment of Australia are poor and deteriorating as a result of increasing pressures from climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and resource extraction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2016, the number of listed threatened species rose by eight per cent, and more extinctions are expected. Climate change is increasing that pressure on every ecosystem. There has been a continued decline in the amount and condition of our natural capital; native vegetation, soil, wetlands, reefs, rivers and biodiversity are all under pressure and declining; land clearing remains unacceptably high; and our coastline is in danger of being loved to death. The report has introduced new chapters dedicated to extreme events, as well as climate change and Indigenous stewardship of land. Environmental destruction costs our economy billions of dollars, with climate change and biodiversity loss representing both national and global financial risk. This is not a 'nice to have'; protecting the environment and our biodiversity is a 'must do'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the commitment by Minister for the Environment and Water—Minister Plibersek—to continue Australia's promise to protect 30 per cent of Australia's land and waters by 2030, under the '30 by 30' target. Australia has already gone well past the ocean goal, with 45 per cent protected. At present, around 22 per cent of Australia's landmass is protected in our National Reserve System. The problem, as the SOE report highlights, is that biodiversity loss and environmental decline in Australia have continued. In fact, they have accelerated, even as our protected areas have grown in recent decades. So, after years of underfunding, our protected areas urgently need proper resourcing and management. Without that, protected area targets just don't mean much. They won't work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental management is not well coordinated, and it is one of the biggest challenges to reversing the decline in our natural environment. In total, public protected areas like national parks have only contributed to around five per cent of the expansion of terrestrial protected area since 1996—only five per cent. Non-government organisation land purchases, Indigenous protected areas and individual private land holders have facilitated 95 per cent of the growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coordination of environmental management is vital not only within the protected areas but also outside those areas. We're ignoring the drivers of biodiversity loss, such as land clearing, resource extraction and mismanagement, while drawing lines around poorly funded protected areas. Ultimately, this will defeat the environmental goals. As a case in point, the Albanese government's recent decision to open up 46,000 square kilometres of ocean to oil and gas exploration and seismic testing shows that the new government is big on talk when it comes to the environment, but that is all it will be if you follow it with actions like this. You cannot continue that way. The release of new exploration must be cancelled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> environment </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021</span> report credits Indigenous knowledge and management with helping to deliver on-ground change. This includes traditional fire management. Partnerships between traditional owners and the federal government have produced 81 Indigenous protected areas, mainly on native title land. These cover some 85 million hectares, fully 50 per cent of our entire protected land estate. Independent ranger and Indigenous ranger groups are also managing country outside the Indigenous protected area system. Work must still be done to empower Indigenous communities and enable Indigenous communities and their knowledge system to improve our environmental and social outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, if we're talking about environmental protection, we must talk about Professor Graeme Samuel's review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It's very clear that we need strong national environmental standards. We need an environmental assurance commissioner, and we need to ensure that climate change impacts are included in all assessments of projects under the EPBC Act.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I commend the member for Fremantle for bringing this very important matter before the House. Over the past decade there have been extensive debate and differences of opinion about global warming and climate change. If the predictions by the majority of climate scientists are correct, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Centigrade has become a race against time, and the consequences of not doing so would be catastrophic. Of similar urgency but, regrettably, with much less public focus has been the degradation of global biodiversity and the loss of so much flora and fauna.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, global warming and biodiversity loss are intricately linked and have common factors. Both have a direct correlation to population growth and rising gross domestic product. In simple terms, as populations increase and consumption increases, the earth's environment is increasingly depleted. Land clearing, air and water pollution and climate change all contribute to environmental demise and biodiversity loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that the natural environment is incredibly resilient. We have seen how quickly the environment can bounce back from droughts, floods and fires once conditions normalise. However, when flora and fauna are completely lost—when they become extinct—there is no bounce back. When regeneration does not occur, other animal and plant species are also at risk because the natural food chain has been disrupted. That ultimately has implications for the future of humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> state of the environment 2021</span> report, which highlights the extent of environmental decline in Australia, was so important. This is not the first report, however, that has drawn attention to Australia's biodiversity loss and its poor environmental record. Last year, the Prime Minister's Environmentalist of the Year for 2003, John Wamsley, released an excellent research paper on species extinction in Australia. John's calculations show that, in 2021, 17.6 per cent of Australian species were threatened or lost, and the number was expected to double to 35.2 per cent by the year 2041. That's in 20 years time. Those figures alone should worry each and every one of us in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed, however, how quickly the sectors who stand to gain the most by their environmental recklessness were out discrediting the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021</span> report, and I noticed some members opposite doing the same. In other words: 'If the report doesn't suit our own agenda, we'll do what we can to discredit it in order that we can continue to cause the damage that has been caused for so long.' According to that 2021 report, Australia has the third-largest cumulative loss of soil organic carbon in the world, behind only China and the USA. At least 19 Australian ecosystems are showing signs of collapse or near collapse. The destruction of Indigenous heritage continues at an unacceptable rate, against the wishes of traditional custodians, and, since 2016, 202 animal and plant species have been listed as threatened and matters of national environmental significance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the report found that improving the environment required national leadership; integrated management between federal, state and territory laws; and better monitoring and reporting. I can recall how, when some EPBC legislation went through the last parliament, the last coalition government was quick to hand responsibility back to the states and offload its responsibility. The truth of the matter is that all three levels of government, and the community more broadly, have to work together if we're ever going to make the difference that is required. If we don't, it won't be only countries overseas that will pay the price; we here in Australia will as well. Our own ecosystems and our own productivity will diminish as a result of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Samuel review, I believe, was an excellent review which drew attention to all of this. I'm pleased to see that Minister Plibersek has brought a new focus to the government's responsibilities when it comes to the environment, and I welcome the Albanese government giving the environment the priority it deserves.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion about the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report 2021. As a South Australian I want to address some commentary in the aftermath of the release of this report, and some broader concerns I've got about the new minister regarding the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In particular, I found—and I'm sure the member for Riverina will agree with me—some of the suggestions and the diminishing of what has already been achieved through the implementation of the plan thus far absolutely appalling. I acknowledge that there are communities that have made real sacrifices as we have moved through the process of deploying that plan, and there are some difficult questions into the future—there's no doubt about that—but to belittle and demonise the work that has already been done is absolutely outrageous and appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the issue of 450 gigalitres, but it is incorrect to suggest that the plan is 450 gigalitres. It is 3,200 gigalitres. As for the 2,750 gigalitres—the initial amount in that plan—we are well on the way to fully achieving that water. That has been through good partnerships and a lot of hard work, and it's something we should be very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are enormous challenges around the world at the moment when it comes to water management. A lot of people don't realise this, but, globally, many see what we've done in this country as exemplary—a great example of how to take on these really serious challenges. It's happening with the Nile River in Africa. They've got huge issues with Lake Mead in the Colorado River in North America. The Rhine is basically running dry because of a very significant drought in Europe. And, of course, China's Three Gorges Dam has major operability challenges. We're very lucky that we've had good rains recently and over the last couple of years, but we fully understand and respect that challenges are going to continue to be there in managing the Murray-Darling Basin and implementing the plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest that we've achieved two gigalitres is outrageous. It is absolutely outrageous. That is looking only at the 450-gigalitre element and not looking, respectively, at what has happened with the 2,750 gigalitres, which, of course, was the initial component of that. To briefly digress, it was the Howard government who legislated the Water Act 2007 on the back of the millennium drought, understanding that we needed to have an integrated way of managing the Murray-Darling Basin so it didn't collapse. None of us want to see that river system collapse. It's a great challenge of federation—one of the many challenges of federation we've come to understand more and more about in recent years—that waterways are not the purview of the Commonwealth government. That leadership in 2007 was about bringing together state governments and the ACT, the relevant constituent state and territory governments within that basin, to say that we have to come together to manage some of these challenges through establishing the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, which then developed the plan through the Rudd-Gillard era in 2011-12. That was adopted, and we are now at the point where the plan, if it's to be implemented in full and on time, has to happen by 30 June 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a very challenging thing to do, but Labor went to the election saying they would do it. The Prime Minister came to my home state and said, 'If you vote Labor and elect the Labor government, we will fully implement the Murray-Darling Basin Plan on time and in full.' We've since seen the curious situation of the appointment of a minister who didn't really want the portfolio and the tensions between a Prime Minister and an environment minister—possibly an appointment to set that minister up for failure. As a member representing a constituency in the city of Adelaide, which relies on the Murray-Darling for our water supply, I won't allow them to weasel out of this commitment. They knew exactly what the challenge was when they said to the people of South Australia, 'We're going to fully implement that plan on time and in full.' It is a difficult task. They came to South Australia and said they would do it. I won't allow any environment minister or any government that said one thing before the election to think they can get away with weaselling out of it afterwards. I'll be following this very, very closely and speaking at many more opportunities that I get in this place and in the House to make that point well and truly heard by this government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  In 2019, the world's largest bushfire from a single ignition point swept through the precious Blue Mountains World Heritage area. The now infamous Gospers Mountain fire devastated 80 per cent of the World Heritage area, and you can still see the scars. It killed billions of animals alongside the other fires that burned across the country. In our region, it went through a million hectares. That bushfire and the other ones right around the country contributed significantly to the overall picture of environmental decline that we see in the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2021</span> report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, more mammal species have been lost than in any other continent. This is not something that's only happened in the bushfires; it's been happening for a long time. It was really disappointing that the previous government didn't reveal this information as soon as it had it in its hands, to be upfront with people and say, 'This is what we're facing.' They didn't want that grim picture of the nation's environment to be out in the lead-up to the federal election. But I'm very pleased that it was one of the first things we did in coming to government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report is one of the most important documents for those people living in sensitive areas like the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, who deserve to know the truth. While we can't undo all the damage we've inherited, we can recognise that the legislation that sets the rules, the EPBC Act, is not up to scratch and needs to change. I look forward to working with the minister in the coming months as we make those changes and find a pathway forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a bit about the Blue Mountains and what's so special about that World Heritage area, just one example of it. It's been a really long and continuing battle to preserve the Blue Mountains environment. The story of the mighty Blue Gum Forest in the Grose Valley is a really good example. We have just marked the 90th anniversary of a group of bushwalkers saving this forest from the axe after they pooled resources and bought a lease to preserve it for future generations. The Blue Gum Forest is a magnificent stand of eucalypts located within the Blue Mountains National Park, and it's only accessible via walking tracks. The New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service says that those who know it well speak of the forest in hushed tones because, once seen, it's never forgotten. While its preservation might not seem like such a big deal in 2022, when much of the Blue Mountains is protected by national parks and World Heritage, it was a seminal event back in September 1932.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the story. Soldier settlers Clarrie Hungerford and Bert Pierce had cut a track into the valley in 1930. Hungerford planned to clear the extensive <span style="font-style:italic;">Eucalyptus d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eane</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span> forest to plant walnuts on a 40-acre lease that he held. But a group from the Sydney Bush Walkers and Mountain Trails Club were horrified to learn of the plans after bumping into Hungerford and Pierce during a camping trip at Easter 1931. They set out to see what they could do to stop them. They formed a committee, with Myles Dunphy—a name a very well known, respected and loved in the Blue Mountains—as secretary. They raised funds and they purchased the lease off Hungerford for 130 pounds. The government proclaimed the reserve for public recreation on 2 September 1932. The forest was saved, and it has just marked its 90th anniversary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Blue Mountains Association of Cultural Heritage Organisations says, the forest was to be the 'cradle of today's New South Wales conservation movement'. It would be swallowed up by the Blue Mountains National Park at the beginning of the 1960s—that's a whole other story—but the Blue Gum Forest remains a magnet for bushwalkers today. It's our responsibility, going forward, to make sure that our rules can protect its integrity so it's there for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting our environment also means ensuring there are adequate preparedness, response and recovery mechanisms in place when national disasters like bushfires and floods hit. The Albanese government has announced the establishment of a new agency, NEMA, the National Emergency Management Agency, bringing two other agencies together. The communities that I represent in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury, which have been hit by natural disaster after natural disaster, know that we can coordinate this better. But not only should it protect people; it should also be looking at how we protect the environment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I'd like to take a moment to thank the member for Fremantle for bringing this matter to the Chamber. The<span style="font-style:italic;"> State of the environment</span> report—published in 2021 but released, by the new environment minister, only last month—was a shocking read. If the IPCC report was a code red for the world, the<span style="font-style:italic;"> State of the environment</span> report is a code red for Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marine heatwaves caused mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Waterways, beaches and shorelines are in generally poor condition in areas near urban centres, yet mostly in good condition in more-remote areas. The impact of the catastrophic 2019-20 bushfires killed or dislocated between one billion and three billion animals. Australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent and has one of the highest rates of species decline in the developed world. More than 100 Australian species have been listed as either extinct or extinct in the wild. Over the five years to 2019, nearly 290,000 hectares of primary forest and 343,000 hectares of regrown forest were cleared. Rivers and catchments are mostly in poor condition, and native fish populations have declined by more than 90 per cent in the past 150 years, a trend that continues. How did we find ourselves here? Sea level rise has affected many low-lying areas, including Kakadu wetlands. Saltmarshes across much of Australia's coast are losing territory to mangroves. At least 19 Australian ecosystems are showing signs of collapse or near collapse, and the destruction of Indigenous cultural heritage continues at an unacceptable rate. We must make change now, or the consequences will be devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Wednesday, 7 September, is National Threatened Species Day. I learnt that this date was chosen because, on this same date in 1936, Australia's Tasmanian tiger, the thylacine, slipped over the extinction line. But thinking about species decline on just one day a year, whilst a snazzy marketing idea, is just not good enough. Our natural environment laws must protect all Australian native animal and plant species that are facing similar fates to that of the Tasmanian tiger all year round. Professor Graeme Samuel could not have been clearer when he said that a strong, independent cop on the beat is required. Native animals don't pay attention to electoral boundaries or state borders. We must have a nationally consistent protection plan. In addition to the long list of animals and plant species in decline, habitat destruction and clearing, introduced species thriving, diseases and invasive pests wreaking havoc on our land, the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report also made it crystal clear that our climate is changing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, most major Australian cities are growing at a faster rate than other developed cities across the planet. The pace of growth has increased urban heat, congestion, pollution and waste and has put rising pressure on water and energy resources. We're experiencing more extreme high temperatures, more bushfires and more intense rain events. Sea temperatures are also continuing to rise. Each of these factors in turn affects the liveability of our cities. North Sydney is paying the price with more traffic congestion on our streets, more air pollution around our schools, a loss of more than 3½ thousand trees and 750 mangroves and seagrasses, and a loss of 15,000 square metres of green space from our parks and reserves, like Cammeray Park and Flat Rock Gully. While the North Sydney community will fight to protect and enhance our green corridors, which are fundamental to the nature of our community, by advocating to ensure infrastructure projects undertaken in our electorate provide solutions for the next century, we must have, and we need the support of, a national framework to underpin our arguments. We must have a nationally consistent planning process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change and biodiversity loss are closely interconnected and share common drivers through human activities. Both have predominantly negative impacts on human wellbeing and the quality of life. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report makes it crystal clear. Planning processes must be consistent nationally, and we must address both issues with urgency.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  I was one of the millions of Australians horrified by what the <span style="font-style:italic;">St</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021</span> report contained, when it was finally released. This report was delivered to the former government last year, yet the previous government chose to keep it under wraps until after the federal election, and we now know why. It's a massive, carefully researched scientific document. It's also an extremely confronting read, but, regardless, Australians deserve the truth. That's why the Albanese government's Minister for Environment and Water released it in July this year, just weeks after coming to office. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report puts our nation's environmental status under the microscope, and the results are sadly damning. It portrays the ugly truths about us and our environment. To be blunt, it's frightening. Many of our beautiful places, natural features and iconic flora and fauna are under severe threat. The S<span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment </span>report reinforces this horrific picture. It tells us that Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. Threatened flora and fauna has grown by 20 per cent in the past five years, with places literally burned into endangerment by catastrophic fires. The Murray-Darling fell to its lowest water level on record in 2019. Australia now has more foreign plant species than native ones. In my own electorate of Corangamite, just as in many electorates across the nation, we are seeing the stresses on flora and fauna in wetlands and the impacts of rising sea levels on foreshore habitats. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we see from the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report, the previous government was no friend to the environment. Too many urgent warnings were either ignored or kept secret. The previous government had a decade to fulfil the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. By the time the Morrison government left office, they had only delivered two of the promised 450 gigalitres of environmental water. The Morrison government made a series of pledges on recycling but had no real plan to reach them. In 2018, the former government cut the highly protected areas of Commonwealth marine parks in half, removing the largest area from conservation in Australian history. The Liberals and Nationals spent less than $17 million of the $216 million they promised to upgrade Kakadu National Park's infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost two years ago, the Morrison government received an official review into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It was written by Graeme Samuel and its message was as blunt as the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report. Professor Samuel said the act was outdated and required fundamental reform. There's an almost universal consensus that change is needed. Again, the Morrison government chose to ignore that. Much of the destruction outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report will take years to turn around. That's why this government will take no time—we will waste not a day—in taking significant reform steps over the next three years. Legislating strong action on climate change is a crucial start. For this term of government, the environment minister has set out three essential goals: to protect, to restore and to manage Australia's environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To offer proper protections, we need to set clear national environmental standards with explicit targets around what we value as a country and what the law needs to protect. This will require much work. It will require environmental management which needs to return to trust and transparency. Decisions need to be built on good data, to show the public how we're tracking in real time. We also need certainty and efficiency; better environmental outcomes; and faster, clearer decisions. To help guide that change, by the end of the year the Australian government will formally respond to the Samuel review. We will then aim to develop new environmental legislation for 2022. We'll consult thoroughly on environmental standards. We'll make it easier for First Nations people to protect their cultural heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, Australians voted resoundingly for the environment. They voted for action on climate change. After a lost decade, a decade of going backwards, we can't, and won't, waste another minute. Our planet, our biodiversity and our very existence are at stake.</span>

They're not going to waste a day, we hear.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take issue with the member for Corangamite, because a lot was done under the previous government. There were practical solutions such as Landcare. Around $1 billion was allocated to Landcare for the period between 2018 and 2023. That money is going to go to solutions on the ground, not stripping miners of their jobs or stripping away water through buybacks from farmers. When you enter Griffith, there's a billboard that proudly declares, 'Riverina winemakers —one in four glasses of wine made here.' That's not just one in four glasses for the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area; that's one in four glasses of Australian wine produced in and around Griffith. How do they produce that wine? They produce it because they get valuable water from the Murray-Darling, which is then used to grow all manner of things, let alone vineyards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I make here is that I well recall, on Friday 29 October 2012, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard standing on the wharf at Goolwa and declaring that an additional 450 gigalitres of water were going to go to the environment—all well and good. We all need the environment, and farmers get a bad rap. They are the best environmentalists in all the world. Make no mistake: they have to be. They have to protect land and water. They have to make sure that their future is going to be secure. I get just a little bit tired of listening, as we have in this debate, to people such as the member for Warringah—and good luck to her.

                  </a>  Tiny—extremely tiny. But the member for Warringah is trying to tell Australians, particularly regional Australians, how they should live their lives when they are doing the hard yards when it comes to making sure that we've got such things as solar farms and those dreaded wind turbines and that all of the environmental advantages that we're going to do to lower emissions are being done. The burden is being carried by regional Australians.</span>

I appreciate that he gets a bad reputation sometimes, but the work that Matt Kean did with the Wollemi pines in the last lot of bushfires, those dreadful Black Summer bushfires, saved those dinosaur trees, as they're called. It was a great effort by the New South Wales coalition government to make sure that they protected those trees, but the Sugar Pines Walk at Tumbarumba was, indeed, largely destroyed by those fires.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take umbrage with what was being declared, as though this was the first-ever fire that happened in Australia. We've had terrible fires before. Nobody likes fires. Nobody likes fires at all, but they do happen, unfortunately. When members opposite come in here and try to seek political advantage by declaring that this happened on our watch because of the policies we were putting in place, I call that nonsense, because it is a nonsense. Whilst they can say that all will be alright now because we've got a Labor-Greens government in play in Canberra—well, good luck, because you're going to have more droughts, you're going to have more floods and you're going to have more fires. It's not just because of climate change; it's a natural event that occurs in Australia.

On the topic of bringing back the thylacine. there is a podcast out saying that science is going to reproduce the Tassie tiger, last seen in 1936. I commend that to her. I appreciate the member for Fremantle coming into this place, putting in place the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the environment</span> report and making out that nothing happened under the coalition government. There was record funding. The Great Barrier Reef is in good shape now. Murray-Darling—got along with a lot of good there.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to address this enduring question: how do we keep Australia safe? We've always had geography on our side, and, until recently, we've had time on our side as well. Culturally, we've seen ourselves as the lucky country. That era is over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's strategic environment has degraded rapidly, and it continues to degrade as tensions in the Indo-Pacific mount. Whether in our region or in eastern Europe, authoritarian powers are on the move. China is undergoing the largest peacetime military build-up since the Second World War. Russia has launched an unprovoked and unjust war on the Ukrainian people. This has strategic, economic and social implications, and they are all connected. Indeed, this era requires considered political leadership and statecraft. We need it now. Time is no longer on our side, but time remains of the essence. Now enters the member for Herbert! Knowing this hard truth inspires action, and we have reason to act. There is much about Australia to preserve and protect: the values and the principles that govern our citizens and our nation, freedom, the rule of law and our liberal democracy, which is one of the oldest in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peace is the cornerstone of prosperity and security, and we know its price. Over the past century, more than 100,000 fallen Australians have paid that price with their lives. Cenotaphs across this country remind us of this truth. Right now, our nation faces many challenges: fiscal pressures, the aftermath of the pandemic, cost-of-living strains, the widening pain of inflation and other economic headwinds. With these challenges, we can be distracted from defending freedom and peace, and we can hope that everything will work out okay, but, as authoritarian powers build up and ruthlessly deploy their militaries, we must not forget that weakness is provocative and that, in standing for our values, we must stand strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing strong means a commitment to hard power. It means being ready for tomorrow's threats and it means speed—speed to acquisition and speed to the battlefield. It means deterrence: making an adversary think twice before threatening us. It means strike—long range, accurate and lethal. It means asymmetric thinking and approaches: how can we overmatch our natural strengths against an adversary's vulnerabilities? It means having a sense of urgency and a bias for action. Standing strong also means growing our greatest asset, our people. We need a whole-of-nation orientation to the strategic challenges before us. The ADF and our defence establishment must lead, but it will be a shared contribution by all Australians. We must stand, we must stand strong and we must stand together. That's how Australia has always done it—working together, sharing the burden and lending the hand. It's how we'll get it done again. And politics is no exception—this is a bipartisan challenge that calls for collegiate solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want the government to succeed in keeping Australia safe, and we want the Defence Strategic Review to build on the work that the former coalition government has done to date. Sir Angus Houston and Professor Stephen Smith have an ambitious task ahead, made more difficult by the sense of urgency it requires. We want them to succeed. That's our commitment to standing together. We want the review to bring together fresh perspectives to hard questions and to lead to the best outcomes. We must not go backward, and, in fact, making the tough calls is the only way forward. So, at the very least, the DSR should guarantee no cuts to Defence. The government should ensure that spending stays higher than two per cent of GDP. This is an imperative, given the inflationary impact on our purchasing power. We must commit to spending what we need to spend. We must have a floor, not a ceiling, and we must be able to increase expenditure as and when required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another way in which we stand together is through the AUKUS security pact. AUKUS represents important and timely teamwork with some of our closest and oldest friends. It includes, but goes well beyond, nuclear powered submarines. It's about other strategically significant capabilities like hypersonic missiles and long-range strike; quantum and artificial intelligence; cyber-resilience; and electronic warfare. It will also mean nation building for the task—generational investment in education and technology, and facilitating the movement of people between our three countries. And so it's right to call on the government to rapidly build the framework of AUKUS at all levels. It has to be done; inaction and failure are not an option. It will require singular focus and determination. We will do our job by supporting government in advancing this national cause, but we will also hold them to account should they falter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to talk about some of the great work our local Defence Force and the defence industry are doing on the New South Wales South Coast. My electorate is home to the only Navy air station, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>. Jervis Bay is also home to HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span>, the Royal Australian Naval College. Defence and the defence industry are our biggest employers, and we are proud of the amazing things they do for our community and our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">2020 Defence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">trategic </span><span style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pdate</span> identified that our national security landscape was changing more rapidly than predicted, so we need to make sure that our Defence Force remains positioned to meet these challenges. That's why the Albanese government has announced the Defence Strategic Review to examine the force structure, posture and preparedness, as well as our investment prioritisation, to ensure that we have the right capabilities to meet our growing strategic needs. I welcome this review. It's a positive step forward in recognising that changes may be needed to how we support our Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say that, as a Navy town, our community is already starting to see shifting needs in defence and is pivoting to make it happen. Last week I took a tour of Air Affairs Australia's Advanced Manufacturing Centre and Aerospace Training Services facility in South Nowra. The Shoalhaven has a significant defence industry, and Air Affairs is a world-leading specialist in manufacturing and training, with a focus on Navy. Air Affairs products are in demand globally, and, prior to COVID, exports made up 70 per cent of its business. I'm told that this is because much of the equipment that Australian Defence sourced was imported. In a great example of the holes we had in our defence strategy: when COVID hit, those supply chains were interrupted or destroyed. We didn't have much of the critical equipment needed. In an impressive pivot, Air Affairs, among others, was there as a recognised and proven defence industry manufacturer, and now 90 per cent of its products are sold domestically. This is not because exports have dropped off but because domestic demand has skyrocketed. With one look at their amazing facility, it isn't hard to see why. In the words of Darren, who showed me around, Air Affairs is making manufacturing sexy again, with clean manufacturing, local apprentices and local jobs supplying our local Navy base. What could be better?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Air Affairs has apprentices at every level across all trades—manufacturing, processing, electrical and painting—mostly with graduates from local schools. They provide a one-stop shop for defence products, using automation to complement their workers, including with 3D printers and some of the most complex machinery you've ever seen, overseen by all levels of mechanical engineers. As a former TAFE teacher, what impressed me the most was their drive to recruit and train local young people from high school all the way through, showing them they can have a good career right there at home. While I was there, I met Ross, a mechanical engineer, who was originally in the automotive industry. Now he trains four or five apprentices at a time in hand and eye precision. It was great to see the work Ross and all the workers there were doing to help equip our Defence Force for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, I also had a look at the Aerospace Training Services facility. Air Affairs has just secured a five-year contract to train all HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>'s Romeo helicopter avionics crew men and women. After finishing with HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Cerberus</span>, they come from around Australia to Nowra for 18 months to complete their training based at <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>. The training centre embeds Navy officers with them and allows them to train on replicas of the equipment they will be using. With the proximity to <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>, it helps to really prepare these young people for long careers in our Defence Force. They come out with a Certificate IV in Aeroskills, and Air Affairs is excited to provide the next generation of Navy crew with the skills they will need for our future. It's truly fantastic stuff. Thank you to Chris, Darren and Kate for showing me around, and thank you for the fabulous work you are doing supporting our Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more of this: local jobs, local training, local equipment. This is what we need. The Defence Strategic Review will be the most significant review of our Defence Force we've seen in decades. We need to be prepared for the future, and I am excited that the Shoalhaven is front and centre in leading and supporting that future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  I'd like to echo the words of the member for Canning and congratulate him on his appointment to the important position of shadow minister for defence. He has done a great job, and that is demonstrated through his contribution just before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this motion is saying is absolutely critical to the future of our country. We live in a time of great uncertainty, unlike any we've seen. To be prepared for the unthinkable, we need to continue our investment in our nation's defence. We must continue to build on the work of the former government with AUKUS, and we must commit to building capability and strong defence spending. That means we must not see cuts to defence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government announced its strategic review last month and appointed former defence minister Stephen-Smith and former CDF Sir Angus Houston to run it. It's not a bad thing to take stock and ensure that our structure and posture are appropriate for the times in which we operate, but I have concerns about appointing the former Labor defence minister, who presided over the period when defence spending was cut to its lowest levels since 1938. It is extremely concerning. Past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour. Of course, we'll hear the Labor government saying: 'We're not cutting defence. It's not going to happen. We're not going to cut any spending.' But, just over a week ago, we had the first example of the Labor government using the review to disguise capability cuts in a bid to save money, and it has many in the Defence community worried.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a week ago, the defence minister said the previous government's commitment to replace the underperforming MRH-90 with the tried and tested Black Hawk was fuzzy and that a process was underway to evaluate the capability. This was the same day the US approved the sale of 40 Black Hawks to Australia, hardly the result of a fuzzy commitment. The decision to replace the MRH-90 with the Black Hawk was well overdue. There had been nine incidents where the MRH-90 Taipan was unsuitable to fly. Defence has spent $37 million to hire civilian helicopters to maintain capability because they were grounded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But where do the minister's comments leave us? They leave us with uncertainty. They leave us questioning: What's happening with MRH-90? What's going to happen with the Black Hawk? We are now wondering, will the Labor government now dump the Black Hawk deal? Our soldiers need a reliable, tactical, troop transport helicopter now, which can be used for training, humanitarian missions and on combat operations. That helicopter is the Black Hawk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This would also leave our community of Townsville in the lurch. As the current operating base for the MRH-90, the 5th Aviation Regiment would most likely be the base for new Black Hawks, but now the hardworking men and women there who have had to endure the MRH-90 with all its faults and failings don't know what the future holds. As far as they're concerned, they will be continuing to operate that aircraft for longer than they'd hoped. Since the minister's comments, the negative reaction to this decision has been quite significant. I've received emails, texts, and messages on Facebook wondering what will be happening with the MRH-90, and if the Black Hawk will be coming into service—not to mention that, if another platform is chosen, there could be negative implications for jobs and skills capability at that base. The Townsville defence community was critical in backing the push for the decision to be made in the first place. Now we have people working in the 5th Aviation Regiment facing more uncertainty about their future and operating a helicopter that isn't doing the job it's meant for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this debacle is anything to go by, it's not just the Black Hawk that we should be worried about being on the chopping block with this review—what about the deal to scrap the Tiger for the Apache? Could it be the nuclear subs next? The coalition government returned defence spending to more than two per cent of GDP, including investing more than $270 billion in defence capability. We must continue this trajectory and ensure we do not see cuts to defence spending.</span>

                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I thank the member for Canning for bringing this critical issue to the House today and to this Chamber. We might be on different sides in this place, but when it comes to defence and national security we're on the same side—the side of our nation, the Australian side. I look forward to continuing to work with the member for Canning and other members, such as the member for Fremantle, who have been announced alongside me on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security today in the House. I look forward to working with them on the oversight of our intelligence and security agencies to advance the national interest in a spirit of bipartisanship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That spirit of bipartisanship is so important. While we can disagree on a number of issues, Australians rightly expect that, when it comes to keeping them safe, we will put our political differences aside and get the job done. But that does not mean the decisions of the past government are above reproach. We may be on the same page when it comes to defence and national security priorities, but the execution of those priorities by the Morrison government left a lot to be desired. With respect to the AUKUS security pact, I can agree with the member for Canning's motion to the extent that AUKUS is the biggest development for our national security since the ANZUS treaty some 70 years ago, that it goes beyond submarines and into critical defence capability, and that is also about nation building. It will be vital to maintaining stability in our region and crucial to our naval and defence capabilities this century. But therein lies the issue—this century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it came to fireproofing our defence capability, there was a complete lack of comprehensive strategic oversight by the other mob—the previous government. The nuclear-powered submarines acquired under the AUKUS agreement are unlikely to hit the water until 2040 at the earliest, probably in the mid-2040s. The previous government's cancellation of the French and before that the Japanese submarine acquisitions effectively left us facing a significant capability gap. Given the volatile geostrategic circumstances we face, it is vital to Australia's national security that we have a submarine capability with an increased endurance, transit speed and stealth capability. Australia's national security is now vulnerable because successive governments have botched it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The defence capability gap is compounded by the lack of self-reliance in defence industry, leaving us exposed in the most unpredictable and volatile geostrategic period since World War II. There's plenty of debate and analysis about the contract cancellations, but I think the assessment of the former Prime Minister and his government's failings is rightly scathing. Through sheer incompetence, we had the unprecedented situation whereby the leader of one our most important allies and a major power in our region labelled our own Prime Minister a liar. The Australian people deserve better in their representation on the world stage, and, of course, they voted for better in May this year. Already, Prime Minister Albanese has sought to reset our relationships not just with the French president but also with many other world leaders, and started to repair the damage that had been done previously. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, as Minister for Defence, is acutely aware of the urgent need to improve our defence capability in the short term. He's tasked former defence minister Stephen Smith and former Chief of the Defence Force Angus Houston to conduct the most ambitious review of the Defence Force in decades. This will include an examination of force structure, posture and preparedness, and the prioritisation of investment to improve our capability. This will identify challenges and opportunities over the next decade and beyond as we work to rapidly implement AUKUS and improve our defence posture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to this. It's in our national interest. It's not about politics. It's about making sure that we preserve the stability in our region, the security in our region that has served us so well, and the prosperity that flows from that as we keep Australians safe. That's what we're about; we don't want to play political games with this. We are focused entirely on the national interest, as we should be, and every government of Australia should be focused on the national interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many good parts of this motion by the member for Canning, and we support them, but the point that it is very important to make is that this should be above politics; it should be above partisan politics. It should be about a focus on what is best for Australia and on keeping Australia safe and secure in the coming decade.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion. The coalition has called on the government to guarantee that the Defence Strategic Review will not lead to cuts in defence spending and programs. I'm deeply concerned by reports that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence's review could lead to defence acquisitions being cut. This is a worrying return to a Labor government which, when last in power, cut defence spending to its lowest levels since 1938. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another matter of concern is the appointment of a former defence minister, the former member for Perth, to lead the review. The Prime Minister has said this is the most complex strategic environment Australia has encountered, but what does he do? The Prime Minister appoints the man who oversaw the largest cuts to defence in 70 years to review defence investment. He presided over $5.5 billion in cuts in the 2012 budget alone. It was at this time that we saw defence spending as a percentage of GDP drop to 1.6 per cent, in 2013. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These cuts were felt in a very real way by serving men and women, and were a huge hit to our capability. Defence personnel who were around during the years when the former member for Perth was the defence minister are asking if this review means more cuts to vital equipment and even if their jobs could be on the line. I hope that this review will take into consideration the perspectives of everyone from the diggers through to the officers. What the Australian Defence Force needs now is capability, not more reviews and cuts. Labor must guarantee that they will not use this review as a smokescreen for cuts and delays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, the coalition government increased defence spending to two per cent of GDP. We invested more than $270 billion in Australia's defence capability. The former coalition government embarked on the most significant national naval shipbuilding enterprise since World War II. We set the course for the delivery of nuclear submarines. We delivered the Australia, United Kingdom and United States security pact, otherwise known as AUKUS. AUKUS is the biggest development to our national security since the signing of the ANZUS Treaty over 70 years ago. This security pact will maintain stability across the region and keep Australians secure through the acquisition of capabilities which are crucial to Australian naval and defence power in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government made substantial progress in transforming the Australian Defence Force into a more capable, agile and potent force to deter and respond to threats. AUKUS goes beyond submarines and critical defence capabilities. Since 2016, the ADF has recognised the need to invest in new bases, particularly in northern Australia. The driver of the change identified in 2016 has accelerated faster than anticipated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As host of most major international training exercises, Central Queensland can also become a permanent host location for Singapore Armed Forces, US military and British Army rotations. The Central Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils recommend that CQ offers new basing opportunities that can enable the ADF to better shape, deter and respond to emerging threats in our region. Capricornia is home to Shoalwater Bay Training Area and is already a major contributor to the ADF's current capabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the following recommendations by CQROC. The first is to relocate the Army's 7th Brigade from the Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane to the Shoalwater Training Area. Once on the outskirts of Brisbane, the Gallipoli Barracks are now surrounded and constrained by suburbia, dislocating Army personnel and their families from the brigade's primary training area. To help ensure the Army's 7th Brigade is ready for future threats, relocating it to a new base adjacent to its primary training area could assist. I also support the recommendation to establish a permanent RAAF presence in Rocky. This will also allow the ADF to leverage aviation deep-maintenance facilities currently being developed by Alliance Airlines, which was also supported financially by the coalition government in a project I fought hard for. Rockhampton Airport is the ideal location for a new east coast base due to its long runway and available land for development.  The final recommendation I support is to establish a new school of armour in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area. It would support significant growth in the Army's training requirements for new armoured vehicles.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's strategic environment is rapidly changing, and our military posture needs to change with it. The 2020 Defence Strategic Update makes it clear that Australia's strategic environment has declined rapidly. We are in a period of uncertainty, the likes of which we have not seen for a long time, and the last thing we need is a repeat of the cuts we saw under Labor during the former member for Perth's time as defence minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I want to thank the member for Canning, the opposition defence spokesman, for this motion. As my colleague the member for Wills said before, it's pretty important that we have this defence review, a strategic one, to look at our capability, our circumstances, our force posture and what it is that we want the ADF and some of our other agencies to be able to do. As the Prime Minister has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is incumbent on us … To take stock of the billions of dollars in defence investment programs, many of which are over-budget and delayed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a time for delay</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A shining example of the coalition's track record can be seen in its botched handling of the Hunter class frigate procurement process, which is now facing major delays and soaring cost issues thanks to undefined equipment capability. Those opposite have mismanaged every step of the replacement of the Collins class submarine, a pretty important strategic capability. As a refresher, I note that the former Prime Minister and member for Wentworth signed a contract to buy 12 French Barracuda class submarines, but the terms of the contract were poorly defined to say the least. There's a bit of a trend here. The Australian taxpayer ended up forking out $3.5 billion to France before the contract was clumsily terminated. That's a lot of Black Hawks, which the member for Herbert was just speaking about. Who could forget the damage done to Australia's relationship with France, an important strategic partner in the Pacific, which led to the French President, Emmanuel Macron, stating baldly that the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, had lied to him? It was a devastating blow for that relationship and for cooperation in the Pacific, but the honourable member needn't worry, because we've got those relationships back on track. The Deputy Prime Minister, on last week's visit to Europe, contributed to getting things back on track with the French but also established really good and important strategic relationships with the Germans and many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delivery of the Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles is going to be delayed by another year, apparently, and that comes on the heels of a seven-month delay of the first Boxer delivery. Similar and serious delays have been forecast for the acquisition of the Arafura class patrol boats. Those opposite want to claim that, whilst in power, they made the ADF more agile, capable and nimble. Unfortunately, I didn't get here in time for the member for Canning's contribution, so I didn't get to hear the evidence that that's the case, but I look forward to having a listen later on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1987 defence white paper established a strategic setting for this country for 35 years. Core to that was that we would have 10 years of warning. With the recent Defence Strategic Update, we know that we're well within that 10-year window, so we need a much greater sense of urgency, and I don't see that coming from the department. I know the defence minister will be working on that. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's so much more work to be done to prepare for any potential future conflict in the coming years. Over the next month or so, we're going to have 14,500 troops from about 17 different countries training across the Top End. There will be fighters in the air, navies from all around the world operating in our seas and armies operating across the north. We're doing that for a reason, and a very important reason.</span>

                  </span>For those listening, don't forget that those opposite leased our port in Darwin for 99 years to a company strongly connected with the Chinese communist government. Never let them forget that. Honourable members will remember that their trade minister then took a job with that Chinese company. Everyone will remember that. Australians always ask me about it, wherever I go.

I also acknowledge the bipartisan nature and the way in which these motions are debated, and especially the current member for Wentworth's willingness to support this and to be a part of this important discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Her name was Gerda Cohen and she left Germany in October 1938, a week before the Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, and came here to this country as part of the arrival of a few thousand Jewish people before the start of World War II in 1939. Australia took a few thousand people quietly and, of course, later declined to take a large number of Jewish refugees throughout the war. And then, amazingly, Australia became home to one of the largest populations of Holocaust survivors per capita anywhere in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion marks Holocaust remembrance, but it does so acknowledging that Australia is now a full member of the IHRA—the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. Prime Minister Gillard started Australia's efforts to join the IHRA, and, at the same time, she bestowed the first posthumous honorary Australian citizenship to the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who, I believe, might still be the only honorary citizen of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2017, IHRA unanimously agreed to upgrade Australia's status in the organisation from observer to liaison. Then, following the good work of the previous government, Australia became a full member of IHRA following a vote of the IHRA Plenary. This motion also endorses the IHRA definitions, including on antisemitism, something that I was very pleased that the federal parliamentary Labor Party first endorsed. I acknowledge the Attorney-General in 2016, 2019 and 2022. I also acknowledge that the former coalition government adopted the IHRA definition, as have many state and territory governments, oppositions, and other institutions around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion was also influenced by the fact that the Gandel Foundation, in partnership with Deakin University, had a good look and did a really comprehensive survey of Australians, with over 3,500 Australians participating in it. It tried to gauge Australia's awareness of the Holocaust and our understanding of the atrocities that occurred during that period. While there was, overall, a good understanding of the Holocaust by Australians, a large proportion of Australian society had no knowledge of it, Australia's involvement in it and the lessons that came out of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of the Gandel Foundation is truly astonishing in how it seeks to empower young Australians to engage in Holocaust education. I acknowledge the Victorian government and its leadership in this. I also acknowledge the former Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who gave a significant amount of money to set up Holocaust education centres around the country. This was, and still is, a real passion of the former Treasurer. It's something that he should be very proud of in deepening Australia's engagement in this important chapter of our history and world history throughout the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lessons from the Holocaust are still as relevant today as they ever have been. Obviously, the Jewish community was not the only victim of the Holocaust. There were LGBTQI+ people, political dissidents, communists, trade unionists, political prisoners and a range of people in German society who felt the wrath of the Nazi regime. Every student who walks through the Melbourne Holocaust Museum comes out with a renewed sense of respect and appreciation for their fellow humans and appreciation for the history that we must never forget. So I commend Gandel philanthropy. I commend all members participating in this debate. May we continue to remember and never ever allow it to happen again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I would like to second the motion. In January this year, we marked 77 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. We remembered those who suffered at the hands of Hitler's Nazi regime, including six million Jewish victims and millions of other victims, including those from the LGBTQI+ community, Roma, Sinti, people with disabilities, political dissidents and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, as we are seeing a worrying number of antisemitic incidents reported in our schools and universities, the work of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and other organisations in promoting Holocaust remembrance and combating antisemitism and Holocaust denialism has never been more important. Therefore, on behalf of my community in Wentworth, I'm honoured to co-sponsor this motion, along with the honourable member for Macnamara. I also want to acknowledge the work that my predecessor, the former member for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, did in this work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wentworth is home to a large and vibrant Jewish community. I have lived there almost my whole life. Over the years, I've developed deep, personal connections with many families devastated by the Holocaust, many of whom, sadly, continue to suffer antisemitism today. When I was 20 years old, I had the privilege of visiting Auschwitz with my father. I will never forget that experience. You walk in the gates, and you can't quite believe that what happened there actually happened there. Then you see the piles of clothes, the bags and the belongings of people who died there, and the enormity of what happened starts to sink in—the incomprehensibility of the unimaginable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, I sat in Rookwood Cemetery with members of the Wentworth community, where they read the names of family members who died in the Holocaust. That was another moment when I really felt the enormity of what had happened. It is hard to imagine those horrors of the Holocaust unless you have those experiences that truly educate you about them. Studying the Holocaust—be that in school, visiting Auschwitz or in the local Jewish museum—gives people a crucial understanding of how social, religious, political and economic factors can erode and, ultimately, destroy human rights. It helps us to understand and appreciate the vital importance of our own democratic institutions and their vulnerabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These lessons must never be forgotten, and that is why some of the trends in the Gandel Foundation's recent study, which is so important, are worrying. Nearly a quarter of Australian adults admit to having little or no knowledge of the Holocaust. That number rises to one in three for millennials. The knowledge of Australians about their own Australian links to, or stories related to, the Holocaust is very low. The research also found apparent latent antisemitism in Australia. Some of the trends noted in the Gandel survey are, unfortunately, evident in the worrying rise of antisemitism across our society. As I highlighted earlier today, in the past two weeks, the New South Wales board of deputies, a group that I work with, have received reports of two cases of antisemitic bullying in Sydney's east. These incidents come fresh off the back of another school in New South Wales where students use a chat room to share racist, homophobic and violent misogynistic content. Earlier this year, we saw another case in Sydney where the word 'Hitler' was graffitied across a high-school fence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All members of our community need to feel safe and need to be able to practise their faith in freedom. We need urgent action to educate people about the Holocaust and to fight the rising tide of antisemitism. Whilst the Gandel survey found some worrying gaps in knowledge about the Holocaust, it also highlighted the brilliant work of the Holocaust museums. Among those who replied to the survey, those who had visited the museum were about 50 per cent more likely to have excellent Holocaust knowledge than those who hadn't visited. I have had the honour of visiting the Sydney Jewish Museum and I support the work of the IHRA museums across the country. I understand that there will be new or redeveloped museums in every state and territory, and I support the development of resources that could be shared with communities and schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Holocaust education in our schools is critical. I call on all states and territories to follow the lead of Victoria and New South Wales and make Holocaust education a mandatory aspect of their school curriculum. We also need meaningful implementation of the IHRA definition of 'antisemitism' in our universities. There are still too many antisemitic motions passed by student bodies across the country, and universities are not always safe spaces for our Jewish students, as they should be. I want to see leaders and community members empowered to speak out and take action against incidents when they happen, and I stand ready to support them in their efforts. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I'm very proud to speak on this motion and I thank the member for Macnamara for moving it. It's an important motion for this parliament to debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International Holocaust Remembrance Day is a time to remember the victims of the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime—the six million Jewish victims and the millions from other walks of life. The scale of the death and destruction of people and communities in the Holocaust is almost impossible to comprehend, but the reality of the horrors is something that we should never forget. It's now 77 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. On 27 January each year, we mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We also honour the survivors of the Holocaust. We remember the horrific events to ensure that they're never repeated and to prevent prejudice and hatred from taking root in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, we're reminded all too often of the need to continue to fight against antisemitism and other forms of bigotry. That's why we commit to standing up for tolerance and inclusivity. I've seen in my community the great work on this front of Holocaust survivors, their families and volunteers. Courage to Care is an outreach program of B'nai B'rith, the world's oldest Jewish service organisation, and aims to inform Australians of the dangers of prejudice and discrimination. Since 1999, Courage to Care in New South Wales has run a travelling educational exhibition inspired by many stories of rescue and courage displayed by non-Jews who saved or helped Jews during the Holocaust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A unique feature of the Courage to Care programs is a session with a 'living historian'—a survivor of the Holocaust who shares not only the horrors of their story but also the positive nature of their rescue and survival and explains the support he or she was given by others. I've been fortunate to do a fair bit of work with Ernie Friedlander, who told me how he and his mother escaped the concentration camps as a result of the humanity of a single German soldier. They were the only two in their family to survive. Ernie now devotes his life to antiracism campaigns, and we're working on a march against racism in my electorate in November this year. The program celebrates the people who have had the courage to care for their fellow citizens—ordinary people whose acts were extraordinary in their bravery and impact. I'd like to thank all Holocaust survivors and volunteers from Courage to Care who continue to help individuals to stand up to prejudice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International Holocaust Remembrance Day is a reminder that we must never allow the differences between us to be weaponised. It's a reflection on the atrocities that can stem from dehumanising and devaluing human beings. That's why we all have a responsibility to make sure hatred, intolerance and extremism are never normalised in our communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the world's largest populations of Holocaust survivors per capita. They, along with their descendants, contribute to our vibrant multicultural society. That includes the Maroubra Synagogue in my electorate. A pillar of the thriving Jewish community, it was established in 1948 by Holocaust survivors, with the support of their families and friends. Building the synagogue was an act of faith, belief and defiance, and it stands in everlasting memory of the relatives and friends who perished during the Holocaust. There are now more than 400 member families who belong to the synagogue, and together we acknowledge the importance of Holocaust remembrance in honouring the memory of victims and survivors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International Holocaust Remembrance Day is also a time for promoting tolerance and inclusivity and for combating antisemitism and other forms of bigotry. But it's also an opportunity for education, and I wholeheartedly endorse the elements of this motion that encourage education about the Holocaust, particularly in school curriculums throughout the country. It's vitally important that people are educated about this so we can avoid these horrors in the future. We also endorse the work of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and its efforts in promoting Holocaust remembrance, combating antisemitism and combating Holocaust denial and distortion. Together, we all have a responsibility, not only in this place but within Australian society, to remember the victims of the Holocaust and to continue to stand against antisemitism, racism and intolerance in all forms. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the member for Macnamara's motion on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Can I also say I'm sorry to hear of the recent loss of your grandmother. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many members have outlined here today, it has been 77 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. The appalling treatment of minority groups during World War II, including those of the Jewish faith, is something we can never forget. And yet, sadly, we've seen examples of antisemitism on the rise both in Australia and abroad. I was disgusted during the 2019 and 2022 federal elections to see swastikas and racial slurs graffitied across election materials. I wish I could say it was an isolated incident, but indeed it was not. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Australian Jewish community in my own electorate of Moncrieff were subjected to despicable antisemitic attacks as they gathered to remember the Holocaust. I was among them. Poles outside Temple Shalom in Isle of Capri were covered with flyers containing swastikas and vile anti-Jewish slurs. Flyers were also dropped in the letterboxes of local houses, including the home of a member of my community whose family survived the Holocaust. Those symbols and that behaviour have no place in Australia or anywhere else. Many families, including that of my good friend and former colleague Josh Frydenberg, who has been mentioned already in this place, have been the target of disgusting antisemitic attacks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About 27,000 Holocaust survivors settled in Australia after World War II, making Australia one of the most popular destinations for survivors after Israel itself. These families came to Australia to seek refuge and a better life for themselves and future generations, and we remain determined to keep it that way. There's no place for antisemitism here in Australia or around the world, as I stated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to highlight a little bit of my own experience of visiting a concentration camp in West Germany. In the heart of Bavaria stand the remains, and a replica, of the Dachau concentration camp, which was the first camp built by the Nazis. The concentration camp was in operation for 12 years, from 1933 to 1945, and it took 206,206 prisoners, with deaths to the number of 31,951. The crematoria remain today for visitors to see and to feel. I say 'feel' because there's a chill that comes over one—an overwhelming sadness and fear, and confusion and disbelief that this happened in history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our good hosts in Germany at the time included a German woman whose grandparents hid Jews in their barn for very many years. A lucky few escaped on the death march through a little town called Puch to the Dachau concentration camp, and her family were kind enough, at their own risk, to see a few Jews through the Holocaust. While I and my partner went into the camp, she stayed in the car for fear that she would feel too ill to walk through the gates, which say 'Arbeit macht frei'. Nothing could be further from the truth. That work did not set those Jews free. Other groups, such as Catholics, socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, LGBTIQ people, people of colour, people with disabilities and Romani—Gypsies—were made to wear badges that labelled them as political prisoners, as criminals, as homosexuals, as immigrants, as Jews or as idiots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021, there were 447 antisemitic incidents recorded in Australia. In May 2021 alone there were 88 antisemitic incidents, the highest monthly total ever in our country's history. This is not the Australia we want to be. It's one of the reasons why the coalition invested significant funding to establish Holocaust educational centres or museums around the country. Every state and territory in Australia will soon have a museum to recognise the Shoah.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the late Eddie Jaku OAM, a Holocaust survivor who founded the Sydney Jewish Museum. He was tattooed by the Nazis with the number 72338. Eddie's story is one of suffering but also one of happiness. We must ensure our future generations learn from the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. Those stories will live on with us to ensure those atrocities never occur again.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I thank the member for Macnamara for moving this motion, which I wholeheartedly support. I would like, as have other speakers, to acknowledge the work of the Gandel Foundation, which commissioned the Gandel Holocaust Knowledge and Awareness in Australia Survey, Australia's first comprehensive survey of Holocaust knowledge and awareness. The results of the survey were published in January of this year. While many of the findings are encouraging and even positive, the research team identified some worrying gaps in the community's knowledge of the Holocaust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Macnamara notes in the motion, 27 January 2022 marked 77 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. Seventy-seven years—it's not so long ago. I am only standing here today because my father fled Nazi Germany as an 11-year-old boy, along with his older brother, Richard. They arrived at Station Pier in Melbourne in July 1939. Their parents, my grandparents, also managed to escape the Nazis, arriving in Australia as stateless persons in late December 1939. Three of my great-grandparents could not be convinced to leave Germany. They perished in the Holocaust. I acknowledge that there are other members in this place, on both sides of the Chamber, who, like me, owe their lives to the fact that one or more of their family members managed to escape the Nazis and find refuge in Australia. This is only recent history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, as the motion states, the national survey commissioned by the Gandel Foundation has revealed that nearly one-quarter of Australians have little or no knowledge of the Holocaust. This is despite Australia being home to one of the largest populations of Holocaust survivors per capita in the world. This ignorance has consequences. It breaks my heart to have read reports over the last week of Jewish students at a private school in Sydney being bullied by other students performing Nazi salutes. That followed earlier reports which found that such bullying has become increasingly common in our schools. Do these bullies—these children—understand the significance of these actions? Such incidents should be unthinkable in modern Australia, and yet the number of reported antisemitic incidents in this country continues to rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just Australia. According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport on </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ntisemitism </span><span style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orldwide</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2021</span>, released by Tel Aviv University, antisemitic incidents have increased dramatically across the world in recent years. This report offers a number of explanations for this, including the proliferation of harmful antisemitic discourse on social media since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, we cannot blame these incidents and worrying trends on ignorance of the Holocaust alone. But ignorance is part of the story, and I join the member for Macnamara in endorsing the work of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance in promoting Holocaust education and combating antisemitism around the world. Closer to home, I applaud the move in 2020 by my home state of Victoria to join New South Wales in making Holocaust education a mandatory aspect of their school curriculum, and I encourage other states and territories to follow suit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the battle against ignorance and antisemitism is not the responsibility of state and territory governments alone. Tackling racism and prejudice—including antisemitism—is everyone's responsibility, and, as Attorney-General in the new Albanese government, I will be looking for ways in which the Commonwealth can do more to combat antisemitism. I acknowledge the work of the former member for Kooyong Josh Frydenberg, who, as Treasurer, provided funding for Holocaust museums and education centres across Australia. 'Never forget' and 'never again' are phrases that are often associated with Holocaust remembrance. We must ensure they never become mere slogans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must, as individuals and as a community, remember the Holocaust in order to honour the memory of the victims—not only the six million Jewish victims but also the millions of others who perished, including homosexuals, people with intellectual disabilities and political prisoners. We must remember the Holocaust to honour the survivors of the Nazi regime—those who are no longer with us and those still alive today, including my father, who celebrated his 94th birthday in July. We must remember, because it's only by learning the lessons of the Holocaust we can ensure it never happens again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I thank the member for Macnamara for bringing this very important motion today. Just last week I had the pleasure of meeting the honourable member's former high school teacher Sue Hampel, co-president of the Melbourne Holocaust Museum, who spoke with great affection of her former student and pride for what he is doing in this place. She also spoke with great respect and affection of my predecessor in Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg, who, as I think all the speakers in this debate have noted, has made an incredibly important contribution to the field of remembrance of the Holocaust.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Holocaust Remembrance Day marks the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, and it honours the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and millions of other victims of Nazism. It's a solemn day of mourning and of reflection—a day to remember the millions of people lost and to honour their memories and their legacies. Many victims of the Holocaust are ancestors of Jewish people around the world today. For many, however, their lives were taken before they had an opportunity to begin their own families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The devastation of the Holocaust would be too vast to begin to understand were it not for the courage of survivors telling their stories in the hope that the world never forgets those horrors and so that we can say: never again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One such survivor is Phillip Maisel, who passed away last month, just days after he celebrated his 100th birthday. A Polish-born Jew, Phillip was 21 when he was imprisoned in a Nazi labour camp. He survived, then dedicated three decades to reporting the testimonies of 1,000 fellow Holocaust survivors in Australia. A few years ago, he explained:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If people survived, it was a miracle. When I want to convince people to give a testimony, I just tell them 'You had the privilege to survive the Holocaust, you should talk for those that can't do it anymore'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Maisel was a Kooyong constituent, and I am honoured to know his story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have noted in this Chamber today, antisemitic incidents are disturbingly common in this country. They are worsened by ignorance—ignorance we have to continue to fight on every front. Holocaust Remembrance Day calls upon us all to condemn and guard against intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence against persons or communities based on ethnic origin or religious belief. It's an opportunity to recommit ourselves to ending religious persecution, racism and discrimination in our own countries and around the world. We honour the memories of disabled people, LGBT people, the Roma and the Afro-German people, all of whom were persecuted under Nazism. We honour the survivorship of Jewish people, exemplified by the extraordinary contributions made by the Jewish diaspora across the world and here in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  First of all, I congratulate the member for Macnamara for bringing this motion to the House. I thank all the other members for their very well-read and very well-understood discussion of this motion. I'm an Australian Jew of the eighth or ninth generation, but the Holocaust is very close to me and my family. Very recently, I saw the Sidney Nolan exhibition, <span style="font-style:italic;">Shaken to His Core</span>, at the Sydney Jewish Museum. I was shaken to my core when I heard about the antisemitic comments and statements that have occurred around Australia in the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was contacted by a university student from the University of Adelaide commenting on antisemitic statements in the university magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">On Dit</span>, which included phrases like 'death to Israel' and 'death to Jews', which is disgraceful. Sydney has recently been shaken by chat room messages between members of one of the most prestigious schools in Sydney, with repeated misogynistic and antisemitic messages by many of its students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really important that we remember the Holocaust. In my own family, passed down from my grandfather to my father and now to me, we have a book called the black book, which lists in detail the tragedy and the terrible deaths that occurred under the Nazi regime between 1933 and 1945—six million Jews and millions of Roma. In fact, in my electorate of Macarthur we have some of the Roma who fled Nazi Germany to come to Australia. In the Macarthur area and down to the Illawarra, they made homes for themselves and travelled up and down the coast, having fled the Nazis. Many of their families perished in the Holocaust. As a paediatrician, I see many people with disabilities. The Nazis put to death people with physical and intellectual disabilities, people with mental illness, people who were homosexual or were judged to be homosexual, people who were transgender, and people of different religions. I believe the Jehovah's Witnesses suffered a lot under the Nazi regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Sidney Nolan, I am shaken to my core to think that this can still happen in a society like Australia's. We must remember it. I think it was in 1961 that Sidney Nolan visited Auschwitz, and he painted, I think, over 200 works. When he saw what he had done, he wanted them locked away. He couldn't bear to see them. It changed the direction of his life, he felt. We should feel the same. What happened in the Holocaust should never happen again. We should always remember that a supposedly civilised society can vilify and attempt to destroy a minority for political reasons. It is a disgrace. Sidney Nolan remembered this, and certainly the survivors of the Holocaust remember this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember my uncle, who married into my family, still carried the tattoo on his arm from, I think, Dachau. He would never remove it, because he said that it would be a reminder forever, while he was alive, to never forget what the Holocaust was. I am heartened by the response of the other members who've spoken of the previous Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, of the Gandel family and of the people who are making sure that we do not forget what happened in the Holocaust.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion, and I start by thanking the member for Macnamara and the member for Wentworth, the seconder of this motion, for providing us with this platform. We should always take this opportunity to commemorate such a horror—the murderous tyranny that occurred under the Nazi regime in Europe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly pay tribute to, and thank, those members who have shared their personal stories of their connections, through their families, to the Holocaust. It is quite striking that we have members of this parliament who have members of their family who escaped the horrors of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, that is a tragic reminder of the six million people whose descendants could equally have been serving in roles like members of this parliament and making such a contribution to humanity. That, of course, never came to pass because of the murder of their ancestors in that awful period of history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I too have been to Dachau, just outside Munich. I've also been to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, and I'm very proud that we now have a Holocaust museum in Adelaide. Like others, I pay tribute to the former member for Kooyong Josh Frydenberg, who I was able to work with to secure very important support for that institution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly acknowledge my constituent Andrew Steiner, who is a Holocaust survivor. He was born in 1933; he's about to turn 90 years of age. He, for many decades, has been utterly dedicated to educating school-aged children, in particular, about the Holocaust; about the experience that he had as a boy growing up in Hungary, fleeing Europe and coming to Australia; and about the members of his family that he lost, that were murdered. The people that he came to Australia with had similar scarring experiences. He encapsulates the essence of how vital it is that we continue to educate people, particularly our next generation, on that horrible, murderous period of our history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is depressing to hear stories about a lack of awareness of the Holocaust. It is disgusting to see some of the very recent examples of antisemitism and the glorification of Nazism. We had it in Adelaide a few days ago. These are vile neo-Nazi people, giving their Hitler salutes in front of the Holocaust museum. Who are these people? They are an absolute disgrace. But at least we stand up to that sort of rubbish. We will make sure that the tragic loss of life and the other horrors of the Holocaust are not forgotten with the next generation and every generation into the future. The only good that can come out of the Holocaust is that it never, ever happens again and that nothing anywhere like it ever happens again. The only way that we can ensure that is by all doing everything we possibly can to make sure that the awareness of that horrible period in our history is always present with every generation into the future. There are members of this Chamber that do great work in that regard. I would like to see other states follow the lead of Victoria and New South Wales in having Holocaust awareness in the curriculum, and I don't see why that is a challenge or anything overly controversial. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by quickly touching on a very important element of the motion that the member for Macnamara moved, which is about some people recently seeking to compare things that happened in the pandemic to the Holocaust. There's nothing more disgraceful than people that think they can reference the Holocaust and trivialise the Holocaust by saying, 'This is just like the Holocaust.' There's nothing like the Holocaust. Nothing that we have experienced could ever come close to what happened in the Holocaust, thank God. But it is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful when people trivialise the Holocaust by referencing things that have got nowhere near the horrors of that period of time and thinking that they can reference it to make some kind of cheap political point. So I thank the member for that element of the motion and I thank all those that have contributed to the debate. I look forward to continuing to work towards ensuring we commemorate the Holocaust into the future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the summer of 2019-20, when the Black Summer bushfires were raging, smoke shrouded Sydney like an oppressive blanket. At my GP practice in Narrabeen on Sydney's northern beaches, I saw numerous patients with breathing difficulty. Similar cases presented in hospitals and clinics across the country. More than 4,000 people were admitted to hospital with respiratory and cardiac conditions, and 445 died that summer. Respiratory and cardiac disorders associated with heavy smoke pollution are just a couple of the health impacts of climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Extreme heatwaves have killed more Australians than any other climate related weather event. And fossil fuel air pollution continues to cause more than 5,000 Australian deaths a year. Global warming is also supercharging the spread of lethal transmissible diseases such as dengue, Ross River fever and malaria. More than half of infectious diseases are being made worse by climate change. Less visible are the psychological scars that continue long after the fires and floods pass. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited Lismore and heard the firsthand account of a young woman who narrowly escaped death, when, in the middle of the night, cold, dark, swirling floodwaters rose within inches of her ceiling. She told me of her hours-long struggle to keep herself, her mother and two dogs alive; of the warmth that started to spread through her body as hypothermia set in; of the people who held up their children, screaming for them to be rescued, as an overloaded tinny took them to higher ground; and of her inability to work or simply take a bath since. The physical and mental scars from repeated flooding and other extreme weather events will last for years to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to these disease and trauma related impacts, climate change also strikes at the heart of the social determinants of health. According to the World Health Organization, the social determinants of health account for between 30 and 55 per cent of health outcomes. These are non-medical factors, such as housing, food, water security and employment. Climate change is putting them at risk. What happens to your health when your home is washed away by a flood or is otherwise destroyed? Thousands remain homeless after the past few years of fires and floods. Many are still living in tents without electricity. A roof over someone's head is the key to safety, security and prosperity, and it is the key to good physical and mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong economy and secure employment are, similarly, key drivers of good health. In recent years, hundreds of businesses have been destroyed or had to close due to fires and floods in this country. Consider the builders whose contractors cannot work on a hot roof of a suburban home renovation due to the oppressive heat. As a result, the builder cannot meet his delivery timetable and contractors cannot make their rent. Food and water security are obviously paramount to human health. In 2018, 100 per cent of New South Wales was in drought and farmers were hitting the wall, exhausted from battling day after day with a parched landscape and dying livestock. Increasing floods and droughts both in Australia and around the world will lead to increased food and water insecurity and hence greater geopolitical instability and growing numbers of climate refugees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For over a decade, the health impacts of climate change were ignored, until, in 2019, Labor committed to developing a climate change health and wellbeing strategy. This strategy is the result of the hard work of the Climate and Health Alliance and many others. Some of the things that the sector has identified as important to include in this strategy are a decarbonisation road map for the health system; a public education campaign on the impacts of climate change on health; workshops with experts and practitioners at all levels of government to provide feedback; and, every three years, assessing our health system's vulnerability to climate change. Already, our health system is stretched to breaking point and bursting at the seams. We must take account of, and plan for, the additional burden of disease that climate change will place on the physical and mental health of Australians. It is up to us to ensure that the strategy does not sit on a dusty bookshelf.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion moved by the member for Mackellar today and I commend her for this important motion. The World Health Organization has called climate change the biggest threat to global health this century. We are already seeing this across the globe, with record-breaking heatwaves, fires and droughts in Europe, China and North America. Deadly floods in Pakistan have killed more than 1,400 people and displaced up to 50 million. Famine in the Horn of Africa has put 22 million people at risk of starvation. Rising sea levels are putting the very existence of our Pacific neighbours at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, in just the past five years, we've had a record-breaking drought so severe that in 2019 the Murray-Darling Basin experienced its lowest water level on record. This was followed by record-breaking floods, including in Lismore. In between the two, of course, we had the Black Summer bushfires. I have spoken many times in this place about the impact that those fires had on our region and on my constituents here in Canberra. I have spoken of the choking smoke that blanketed Canberra for weeks, dimming our daylight and making our air the most poisonous in the world. The air quality meant that people were directed to stay in their homes or to relocate if they had underlying health conditions and to use their air conditioning—something which many people didn't have or weren't able to do. The full health impacts will still be unknown to many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, these disasters are here to stay, with fires, floods and drought projected to get worse and more frequent in a changing climate. We know climate change affects the clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter that we rely on for our health. The World Health Organization has warned that, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths every year from malnutrition, disease and heat stress. The World Health Organization estimates the direct damage costs to health to be between US$2 billion and US$4 billion a year by 2030. It is a terrifying scenario, given the strain our health system is going through already in coping with the pandemic. Developing countries with weak health infrastructure will suffer the most. But we know that with climate action we can stop this trajectory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of policy analysis on climate, Australians voted for climate action in the May election. Australians voted for an Albanese Labor government that understands the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change and will embrace them both. I am pleased that Labor is delivering on our promise to take action. Our climate bill to enshrine into law an emissions reduction target of 43 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050 has already passed through the House of Representatives. As we've said, this ambitious target is a floor, not a ceiling, and if we can do better, we absolutely will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working on getting more electric vehicles on our roads, which will immediately improve our air quality and health in our cities and towns. Our support of renewable energy will help firm the grid to help us better cope with climate variables such as heatwaves. For too long, the community has been forced to take the lead on these issues. I want to acknowledge the work of the Women in Climate and Health Network that operates in Canberra, which hosts regular breakfast events, many of which I've attended, about ways in which the community can address these issues, taking matters into their own hands. We're really fortunate to have such a brilliant network of women showing leadership and raising these concerns in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that will now begin to provide the national leadership we need on these issues. The health minister, Mark Butler, has been an advocate of a national climate health strategy. Pleasingly, he's said that he will make climate change a national health priority. That is something he's already started working on with state and territory health ministers. We must work with the states and territories because they hold responsibility for much of our health system delivery, including hospital and ambulance services. Many states and territories have demonstrated their commitment to action by releasing climate change adaptation plan strategies, frameworks and reviews, with health as a core enabling objective. As part of this, the health minister wants to reduce the direct emissions footprint of the health sector and prepare the sector for the impact of climate change, especially heat related challenges and the synergies between good public health policy and good climate policy. This includes active transport and diet. This is a crisis that our world must begin to address together. I am so pleased that, after 10 years of inaction, the Albanese Labor government is giving it the priority it deserves.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the health impacts of climate change and thank the member for Mackellar for this motion. For too long we've talked about climate change impacts, but we haven't addressed the very real way that it will impact everyone in our society, our way of life and our communities. Climate change is a health emergency. It will impact our core health determinants: food supply, housing, employment and water security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Health Organization has described climate change as the defining issue for public health in the 21st century. The WHO warns that the severity of the impact of climate change on health is increasingly clear and threatens to undermine the last 50 years of improvements in health. Think about that. It is just so stark. The IPCC's 2018 special report on global warming states that, if we fail to keep global warming under two degrees, water and food security will be at risk, and some areas of Australia will likely be uninhabitable. From a global perspective, the WHO says that climate change threatens the essential ingredients of good health, clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter, and could undermine decades of progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the major health bodies in Australia, including the Australian Medical Association, support policy and practical actions to limit the health effects of climate change. Doctors for the Environment Australia advocate a health framework in mitigation of climate change risks on health similar to that of the UK. It's quite incredible that, in Australia, we still don't have a national risk assessment in relation to how exposed our communities are to climate change, and we don't have an adaptation or resilience-building plan. There are also direct mental health impacts from extreme weather events and disasters, including post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, grief and suicidal ideation. Such is the prevalence of climate anxiety that the term 'eco-anxiety' has been coined. A recent survey of 10,000 children and young people aged between 16 and 25 years, in 10 countries, including Australia, found that 59 per cent were very or extremely worried about climate change, with 84 per cent saying they were moderately worried. If in this place we are not here to take care of our children's future, then what are we here for? We must address this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a submission to the inquiry into the climate change bill that I presented in 2020, the Climate and Health Alliance and Australian Council of Social Service identified that those most at risk of experiencing health impacts from climate change are, sadly, those already experiencing poverty, homelessness, mental illness and pre-existing chronic disease. The government's strategy must include a plan for those who are most vulnerable and include consultation with persons with disabilities and their representative groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, from 2019 and 2020, the devastating impact on communities of bushfires, and, from just this year, the devastating impact of floods. That bushfire season in Australia was a huge reminder of the health threats of climate change, because we saw the respiratory impacts and the danger to physical life. This year, with the devastating floods across the east coast, we saw loss of life, heavy rainfall and floods contaminate water supplies, jeopardise water security, increase mosquito-borne diseases and increase psychological stress in communities. Floods frequently damage power transmission and generation, leaving people without access to refrigeration or the internet, for information. We saw that firsthand all across the east coast. Even in Warringah we had a flooding event. The prolonged rain and floods along the east coast of Australia are causing an increase of mould in our homes. With that come serious health impacts. Asthma Australia research shows that young children exposed to mould and other allergens appear more likely to develop long-term asthma. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So climate change is a health emergency. The increase of weather events in Australia is clearly linked to the destruction of environmental conditions that provide the basis for our physical and mental wellbeing, impacting the air we breathe, the water we drink, the nutritious food we eat, our homes and our jobs.  I welcome the government's commitment to developing a national climate change health and wellbeing strategy, and I urge the government to outline a time line, funding arrangements and consultation processes. It is a public health priority, but we need to do more. You can't say you're acting and still support fossil fuel projects. It's time to change. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="290544" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Mackellar for raising this important motion. We are colleagues, after all, and doctors. I fully understand the health impacts of climate change, but I would urge that we widen the lens, that we don't just restrict ourselves to human health. There is this concept of one health, where we encompass human, environmental and animal health, and we are all in this together. I think it's important to reframe the concept of health into a much broader concept. When it comes to climate action, we as a government have well and truly moved beyond the 'whether' and the 'if', to now concentrate on the 'how'. We understand the economic, environmental and health imperatives of climate change. We are, after all, living through the era of consequences. The focus really now is: how do we decarbonise and how do we do this as fast as possible? What are the bottlenecks, and how do we overcome them? It's a far more nuanced approach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard, many a time, the problem of climate change—a wicked problem indeed—couched in purely scientific terms. I would say: if only it were that simple. If this were a purely scientific problem, it would've been solved decades ago—solved in the way we found a cure for polio, in the way we eradicated smallpox, in the way we put a man on the moon in the era of blackboards and chalk. This is not a purely scientific problem. This is a social problem, a scientific problem and a political problem, which is why it has not been solved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and the crossbench are in furious agreement regarding the need for climate action, but where we differ is in balancing the competing priorities. And what are they? The climate emergency, no question; energy security, absolutely; and the uncomfortable truth that Australia has been over-reliant on fossil fuels for revenue and for economic security for too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to energy security, this is a red line for government. Australians, their businesses and industry must have access to reliable, round-the-clock energy. To not do so is simply irresponsible and, frankly, unsafe. Then, of course, there is the challenge of diversifying our economy. Australia is a fossil fuel giant and has been for decades. We are the highest exporter of coal in the world and the highest producer of gas in the OECD. Coal and gas are our No. 2 and No. 3 exports, earning, in 2021, $110 billion and $70 billion respectively. These resources have made us rich as a country, and we have our regional communities in places like the Hunter and Collinsville to thank. This revenue has helped pay for hospitals, roads, infrastructure, schools and research, and it has also supported our local communities. But it has come at a cost, and that cost is pollution, which is now fuelling the climate emergency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while I too want us to move as quickly as possible away from fossil fuels, we must have replacement revenue from other sources or we risk compromising those services that Australians rightfully expect. We in this government and this generation will be the ones that tip that balance. And it's already happening. With the passage of our climate bill through the lower house, we are poised to become a renewable energy superpower. This is not empty rhetoric. There are already several large-scale projects that either are coming online or are in the advanced stages of planning. Within a week of the passage of that bill, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy announced that six offshore wind farms were coming online. BlackRock, the world's largest investment manager, have committed $1 billion to large-scale grid batteries, the largest investment that they have internationally. We also have Sun Cable, a company that has an audacious plan to export sunshine from the Northern Territory to Singapore and Indonesia using a cable stretching 4,400 kilometres long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say to our young people, in particular, is that an industry of despair has sprung up around climate change. The problem with this is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When hope walks out the door, so does motivation. I would say to our people: reject this, because this has no place in our world view. There is a long history of humanity overcoming the odds, whether that be rebuilding after World War II, eradicating polio or closing the hole in the ozone layer. Several people said that couldn't happen, but we did it. We must rely on Australians' ingenuity and imagination to get us through this, and we will.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  I thank the member for Mackellar for bringing this very important motion to the parliament today. More than 20 years ago, I spent six months as a paediatric registrar in Darwin. During that time, years ago, I spent some months in Maningrida, about 500 kilometres east of Darwin in the Northern Territory, running medical clinics. The main illnesses that affected the Kunibidji children in the community in which I was working were failure to thrive; infectious gastroenteritis; and ear, respiratory and skin infections. All of those conditions are common childhood illnesses throughout Australia, but they affected First Nations children far more often and far more severely than their urban counterparts. Twenty years ago the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's<span style="font-style:italic;"> Third assessment report</span> found that indigenous peoples are most at threat of suffering the impacts of climate change, along with people from small island populations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years since my time working as a doctor in the Top End, the Northern Territory has gotten hotter. The wet seasons are wetter, the dry seasons more dry. The number of days with dangerous weather conditions for bushfires has increased, and the frequency of extreme weather events has increased. More than 100,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in remote areas of Australia, mostly in communities in the north of the country. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation states that the impacts of climate change amplify the health and wellbeing issues faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, no matter where we live, our environment and our communities are all vulnerable to the changing climate. Five years ago, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span>'s Australian Countdown study confirmed that all Australian cities are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and the impacts of extreme weather events. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners followed up this study and found that Australia's current carbon emissions trajectory is projected to triple—yes, triple—heatwave related deaths in the cities of Brisbane and Melbourne in our lifetimes. If we don't urgently change course, within 50 years the city of Sydney's heat related deaths will increase fivefold. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has also identified climate change as a key public health issue. In addition to the suite of chronic respiratory, cardiac, cerebrovascular and multisystemic illnesses caused by changes to our climate, people subjected to extreme heat, catastrophic weather events and prolonged drought can experience significant long-term mental health impacts and psychiatric illnesses. So climate change is a health crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, nurses, midwives, psychologists, the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians have issued a set of urgent recommendations to the Albanese government for a national strategy on climate, health and wellbeing, including a sustainable healthcare unit within the Department of Health and Aged Care. I wholeheartedly endorse this recommendation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no scientific scenario, no economic scenario and no responsible medical scenario in which Australia can open any new coal projects. Right now there are more than 100 new coal and gas projects coming down the investment pipeline, each at a different stage of development. If these projects come to fruition, they will more than double Australia's carbon emissions, and these coal and gas projects will disproportionately harm Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The previous government handed out $55 million in grants to oil and gas companies seeking to extract fossil fuels from the Beetaloo basin. One of those companies was Tamboran Resources, which was awarded $7.5 million in taxpayer money to explore the area, despite having called on the Australian government to abandon its goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I became a paediatrician to help sick children in my care get better. I came to Australia because I think it's my duty to do everything in my power to prevent the harm that global warming can cause. The people of Kooyong have sent me to parliament to say to the Labor government on their behalf that Australia must urgently transition to clean energy industries and to a net-zero-emission economy. We cannot in good conscience do anything else. To do anything else would be a betrayal of our children.</span>
