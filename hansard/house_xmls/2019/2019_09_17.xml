                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  Of course Labor supports any effort to help communities that are facing terrible natural disasters. We've seen too many in recent yearsâfloods in particular; the bushfires in Queensland at the moment. We've seen the devastating effect that these natural disasters have on communities around Australia, and of course we offer any support and assistance that's necessary. The thing that troubles us about these bills, the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, is not that they see some investment into emergency responses but that they do so at the expense of important investment in education. This is now the government's third attempt to get rid of the Education Investment Fund. They've tried before. They tried again. They're now linking it to funding for natural disasters in a way that unfairly and unnecessarily pits these two worthy aims against each other. Of course we should be helping communities deal with natural disasters, but why this needs to be at the expense of much-needed investment in education infrastructure is not clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want communities to recover from natural disasters and to see mitigation measures that would aid in building resilience in those communities. It's a fundamental responsibility of government to assist communities at these most difficult times, and, of course, when communities are faced with emergencies and natural disasters, there is always a bipartisan effort to support those communities in their recovery. It's part of the basic job of government to protect Australians through these difficult times. We wonder, though, why this needs to be done at the expense of much needed education funding and also why these bills are simply seeking to distribute a maximum of $150 million per year for natural disaster activities when the recommendation was for a larger investment in mitigation activities and when the fund that the government's seeking to wind up is worth $4 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funds come in addition to existing federal funding for disaster recovery efforts. The types of activities that can be funded by the ERF, as proposed, are broad and include carrying out projects, funding services or adopting technology, as long as the activity is directed towards achieving recovery from a natural disaster or building post-disaster resilience. One of the problems with the funding, as it's been described in these bills, is that it only allows for funding of mitigation infrastructure after a disaster has struck. Rather than funding a flood levy, for example, or a cyclone shelter before a flood or a cyclone, it will only provide funding after such a disaster has struck. That's not really mitigation either; that's recovery. It's important to fund these efforts, but it would be much more productive and worthwhile if, in an effort to avert the worst effects of those disasters, we saw the government working more constructively with communities that are in the line of fire of these natural disasters before disaster strikes. Under the national partnership agreement with states and territories the government has only agreed to provide $26.1 million per annum for disaster resilience. That is very much short of the Productivity Commission's 2015 recommendation that the Commonwealth provide $200 million a year in resilience funding. Of course, the ERF proposal is still short of the $200 million a year that was recommended by the Productivity Commission in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems with pitting this disaster resilience funding against education funding is that it has quite often been our universities that have done the most important and worthwhile work in working out the best ways to genuinely mitigate against disasters and to reduce the impact of those potential disasters. In the last federal election campaign, for example, Labor committed $12.3 million to establish the National Institute for Flood Resilience at Southern Cross University. The Northern Rivers is one of the most active flood plains in Australia, so locals know firsthand the devastating impact that natural disasters such as floods can have. It's estimated that floods have cost the Australian economy $18.2 billion a year, so an investment of $12.3 million for the National Institute for Flood Resilience at Southern Cross would have been a fantastic investment to try and prevent floods if we can. The people at Southern Cross University are doing excellent work in this area already. If we can reduce the severity of floods, if we can aid the recovery time from floods, we can save potentially billions of dollars a year, so you can see how short-sighted pitting disaster resilience efforts against investment in education is. The institute we wanted to fund at the last election would have included, for example, a new network of smart sensors in the local area to more accurately predict floods and would have contributed to improving flood-safe education in schools. It's just one example of the nation-leading and nation-building research that is happening right here in Australia that leads to real mitigation of the severity of natural disasters such as floods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The troubling thing about these bills is that they continue a pattern of cutting education in this country. We've seen the refusal to commit long-term to investment in preschool education. We've seen the billions of dollars of difference between what the states and territories expected to receive in school funding from the federal government, when Tony Abbott promised not to cut a dollar from education, and what ended up happening. We've seen billions of dollars ripped from TAFE and vocational education such that there are fewer apprentices today than there were in 2008.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this is phenomenally short-sighted. A great education is the ticket to a lifetime of opportunity for the individuals who get that education and it's the ticket to a wealthier and more productive nation. The OECD and Universities Australia have estimated that the real rate of return to the Australian economy from investing in tertiary education is more than 14 per cent, representing the second-best return on investment in higher education of all the OECD nations. In 2013 the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency found that every extra dollar invested in tertiary education would, on average, grow our economy by $26 within the decade. Many of us in here, including me, are beneficiaries of the significant changes made to tertiary education during the Whitlam and Hawke yearsâthe transformative decision to remove the barriers to tertiary education, to open the doors of our universities to more Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government we continued this great tradition by opening the doors of our universities to more Australians, making sure that a university education is never out of reach because of your parents' inability to pay. After years of neglect under the Howard government, Labor, when we came to office last time, boosted investment in our universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion by the time we left government in 2013. We almost doubled university funding during our time in government. By introducing the demand driven system in 2012, we saw an additional 190,000 Australians get a place at university. That means one in every four of the 750,000 undergraduates in Australian universities at the moment is there because of the changes Labor made when we were last in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also wanted to ensure that the opportunity of going to university was made available to all Australians, particularly those from disadvantaged communities and those who are first in their family to go to university. Looking at the results in the Productivity Commission report, this worked. Since 2012 we've seen a boost of Indigenous student numbers by 26 per cent and a boost of regional student numbers by 30 per cent, and we have more than 36,000 extra students from low-income families, many the first in their family to go to university. In contrast, this effort to get rid of the EIF is one more in a line of efforts from those opposite to restrict, reduce or cut funding to universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first iteration of the Education Investment Fund was called the Higher Education Endowment Fund and it was in fact a creation of Peter Costello. It was in the 2007 Costello budget. It was subsequently boosted by Labor and changed to the Education Investment Fund as part of our nation-building program. It became, at that time, an $11 billion fund. The Education Investment Fund was a key plank in our effort to transform our education system here, and to invest in the physical upgrading of our universities and improvement of the research capability of our universities, to counteract the years of underinvestment by John Howard's government. Since 2008, and until the Abbott-Turnbull government abandoned the program, around $7 billion was provided to co-finance the update and modernisation of Australia's vocational, higher education and research facilitiesâover 71 projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to Peter Costello's purpose in investing in the first iteration, the Higher Education Endowment Fund, he said in the 2007 budget speech, when he introduced it, that the fund 'will be dedicated to building first-class institutes of learningâfirst class by world standardsâand put our institutes of higher learning on a secure footing for ever'. Well, not really forever. The first effort to get rid of this fund, as I said, was in 2014, the second effort to get rid of it was in 2017, and here we are, sadly, in 2019 with the third effort to get rid of this fund. Its purpose, as Peter Costello said was 'to put our institutes of higher learning on a secure footing forever'. He further said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We do not want to limit the future chances of young Australians; we want to build them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, again, these bills do the exact opposite, by demanding that much needed investment in disaster mitigation is paid for by the very valuable fund that has been set aside to invest in our universities. So the Prime Minister is doing exactly what Peter Costello said at the time the government would not do. This government is abolishing a much needed fund and, consequently, limiting the future life chances of young Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, as I said, comes on top of other cuts, including a $328.5 million cut from research last year. It also comes on top of the recapping of university places, which means, in effect, a $2.2 billion cut to our universitiesâlocking 200,000 people, who would have otherwise got the chance of a university education, out of our universities over the decade. By locking people out of education, we lock them out of a job. We're putting a drag on the Australian economy when we know that the economy is already struggling in many respects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, and the world, is facing an economic transformation at this time. We know that work is becoming more complex. Driven by the changes that we're seeing in the global economy, we are seeing opportunitiesâfor example, with the increasing middle-class in the Asia-Pacific region. There are great economic opportunities for us, but they depend on us having an educated workforce that can make the most of those opportunities as they arise. Here at home we face an ageing population. We face technological transformation and digital disruption. On top of that we see: weak wages growth; 1.8 million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed and looking for more hours of work; and productivity growth basically flatlining. All of these elements of an economy that is under pressure, as it is at the moment, respond better when we are properly funding our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to rise to these significant global challenges and become a sophisticated knowledge based economy, we simply cannot continually slash money from our higher education sector. We know that by 2020 two out of every three jobs that are created will require a diploma or higher. We should be supporting Australians to get these qualifications regardless of their background and regardless of where they live. We should be supporting them to access and succeed at university so that they can get the skills they need for the jobs of today and the jobs of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Education Investment Fund enabled investment right around the country, from Charles Sturt University's National Life Sciences Hub to James Cook University's Science Place for northern Queensland and Townsville. In 2014, Deloitte estimated that, by investing in higher education, $140 billion had been added to Australia's GDP through improving productivity. So it is difficult to imagine where we could be more productively investing in infrastructure than in these fantastic teaching and research facilities at our universities in every part of Australia. These universities are anchors in their local communities, both physically and socially, and our nation and our local communities benefit from that investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Newcastle is another great example. When we were last in government, the University of Newcastle were able to leverage our government's investment at that time of $30 million through the EIF with their own funds, as well as $25 million from the New South Wales government. They constructed NeW Space at the Newcastle CBD campus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Yes, very good. According to the analysis, NeW Space alone will deliver $1.3 billion in economic benefit to the Hunter region from 2013 to 2022, including $200 million in construction and a further $134 million estimated to flow annually from the emergence of the Newcastle CBD as a vibrant student hub. It shows how powerful this initial investment from government can be as it is leveraged with money from the university, sometimes from the private sector and sometimes from state governments too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It shows also the impact that these projects can have in revitalising town centres and suburbs. CQUniversity finalised in 2014 a project that brought together higher education and TAFE sectors through a merger of CQUniversity and the Central Queensland Institute of TAFE. This helped create the largest regional university in Australia, with more than 2,000 staff and 35,000 students. The projects there provide people in Central Queensland with a range of post-secondary education and training options that allow them to skill up to meet the needs of the local labour force. It also developed links with the community and local industry and is best placed to provide highly trained, highly skilled, work-ready graduates. When you look at this merger and the investment that's gone into local communities using this fundingâthe Rockhampton Health Clinic, a $14 million investment in Rockhampton; the refurbishment of the Mackay City campus, at $10.2 million; and the establishment of the Mackay engineering building, at $16.6 millionâyou really do have to ask yourself how those opposite, who know how desperately welcome these types of projects are in regional communities, can possibly support the abolition of this fund that has contributed so many worthwhile projects to our regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we talk about on this sideânation-building investment that is, of course, great for the students and staff of these universities but actually changes suburbs, towns and cities too, with jobs in construction and in maintaining and running these projects. These capital infrastructure projects provide the needed stimulus right now. We could be using this money right now to create jobs for those 1.8 million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed, building on our universities and providing long-term productivity growth as we train the workforce and help to teach graduates who will go on to help build our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately these reformsâif you could call them reforms; this is a cut of education funding that the government's pursuingâwill cost jobs. Universities today support 130,000 jobs across Australia. Cuts to regional universities in particular will see regional communities suffer and will see jobs in those communities suffer. For cities like Adelaide, Newcastle, Wollongong and Armidale, which have seen very important investment in universities in the past, when this money dries up there will be an impact. Universities continue to have to do more with less, and to make up for the funding shortfall we have seen universities turn disproportionately to full-fee-paying overseas students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I think the international education sector is fantastic for Australia. But there are two things I'd say about it. One of the things about our university sector that is appealing to students from around the world who are thinking about where they might go to study is that, if our infrastructure is state-of-the-art, it makes us a much more attractive destination for those students. We are competing globally for those students. International education is our third-largest export industry. On the last available data, it brought in $33 billion to our economy. Universities, TAFEs and research institutions have been clear that, if this funding is no longer available, then they will cancel or postpone plans for infrastructure investment and upgrade, and that affects our attractiveness to overseas students. According to the last available financial data from the Department of Education, if you took out the level of growth of international student revenue from university operating results, then every single university would be in deficit. That's very important: if you take out the growth that our universities have received from international student revenue, every single university would be in deficit, according to the Department of Education. So we put our competitive advantage at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern, well-equipped, fit-for-purpose teaching and research facilities are critical to retaining our position in the global rankings as an attractive destination for international students. Our neighbours are not making the same mistake. China, for example, has an aim of achieving 40 world-class universities by 2050. So, we see that this reduction in investment in our universities not only has the effect of lost jobsâbecause we're not proceeding with the infrastructure projects that we could beâbut also means that we are potentially presiding over a worsening student experience. We are seeing courses dropped. We're seeing jobs cut. Charles Darwin University, for example, has had to cut courses and, in doing so, has cut up to 100 jobs. And of course we'll also see the impact on our research output. Simultaneously, we see a concentration of students coming from just a few countries overseas, which really does trouble a lot of people in the university sector because, internationally, economies change very quicklyâeconomic circumstances change very quicklyâand we need to continue to have a diversified range of countries from which we're drawing our international students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus for just a second on regional universities in particular. Regional universities are very often the powerhouses of their local economies. Researchers found that seven in 10 regional university graduates take up work outside metropolitan areas when they graduate and that those universities and students reinvest more than $2 billion a year in regional communities as a result of the economic activity of the university campuses. The Productivity Commission's report tells us that rural, regional and remote students are significantly more likely to drop out if they're having to go to city universities in particular. That barrier of relocating, travelling significant distances or going with online study has seen the results for regional students trailing the results of city based students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does worry me that this potential divide between regional and city communities is so stark and that, by cutting the sort of investment that would improve the student experience at regional university campuses, we embed that divide between our city and country areas. It troubles me that those opposite are not prepared to stand stronger to protect future investment in our regional universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of South Australia, for example, secured $18 million to expand its physical footprint and degree selection into the Mount Gambier and Whyalla regions. That means great opportunities for people who live in those regional South Australian economies. It's allowed them to build new learning facilities and on-campus accommodation and install high-speed fibre-optic cables, making it one of the best connected campuses of any regional city in Australia. Because of this investment, the University of South Australia continues to support economic development and job creation in rural areas by working directly with business and industry, producing graduates who will contribute to the economic, social and culture priorities of the region.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Napthine review had some terrific suggestions for improving the experience of regional students, and, basically, everything this government's done has been the exact opposite of what was recommended. Universities will oppose this, and we will oppose the winding up of the EIF.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I'd firstly like to commend all types of responders to emergencies that happen nationwide, be they firefighters during a bushfire or volunteer SES workers during a storm. We have always had a community that has stood behind one another in times of need, many risking their own lives to protect others and their properties. With the rising rate of natural disasters and emergencies that occur, we will need to stand together stronger and defend each other better. Even recently we have had incredible examples of selflessness by members of our community in dangerous situations, such as in the recent bushfires across the Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast and parts of northern New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 have been formed to show the government's appreciation for and acknowledgement of these services that play a vital role in our community, not to mention the fact that a large portion of them are volunteer members of the community. Through the creation of this fund, Australia's government will always have resources available to help those in crisis situations within our global community. Putting aside $4 billion as an initial investment, which will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, we can expect a large return on this long-term commitment by the government in assisting communities ravaged by disasters as well as investments into the prevention of such issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was reviewed that, at the previous date, the emergency services and subsequent programs were not at a standard that could meet the scale of possible catastrophic events in the future. Thus, a large part of this fund would be put towards the improvement of such resources until they reached the criteria for what the community needs and deserves. The Australian people deserve to have emergency services that can act quickly and save lives without waiting for any bureaucracy to send them forward. They deserve to have fire services that can jump into action at the first sight of an emergency. With these bills we will have more funding to put towards things that our community needs and deserves in times of emergencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Mackellar I have 10 Rural Fire Service brigades, marine rescue stations and many other emergency service volunteer groups who do excellent work keeping the great people of the northern beaches of Sydney safe. I acknowledge the northern beaches firefighters who have deployed to Queensland and northern New South Wales to assist in combating the out-of-control fires in those areas. I am informed by RFS brigades that multiple volunteers from the beaches, but also all over the state and country, are heading north to assist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the use of grants and investments into prevention methods such as new and improved infrastructure that can withstand future natural disasters of all categories and the adoption of innovative technology we will be able to protect and help Australians who have been, or will be, affected by these disasters. Not only that, but the grants can be used in the recovery efforts for producers and small business owners to educate them and give advice on the risk of any future land ventures, the recovery and re-establishment of their livelihoods and the investment into tools for better knowledge and understanding of local climate viability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, the fund will move to a maximum of $150 million a year to fund natural disaster recovery efforts and all types of emergency responses. This allotment of resources is already above and beyond what was previously set out to cover the original cost of the recovery programs, but now they can use a large portion of the Future Fund to plan for the future. This will be put back into investments and, therefore, yield a large long-term growth. This in turn will help our communities to protect themselves, and each other, against the natural disasters that are becoming ever more frequent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the ever-changing circumstances of natural disasters and climate, this fund will come under review within 10 years of establishment. This will allow the responsible minister to inform both houses of parliament of a public review of the bills. It is important that we refresh and modernise the bills for the safety and benefit of the Australian community. This measure speaks to the coalition government's commitment to being adaptive to changing landscapes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One might question whether it is time to invest in larger, high-risk operations, but the Future Fund board will be responsible for the investments of this fund. With the government having worked with the board for over a decade, we have seen them managing six other funds successfully to a benchmark and even outperforming what was expected of them beforehand. This has created trust, a strong relationship and a reputation that makes us feel secure to invest this fund with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, these funds will also be used in a robust and transparent framework that clearly details how, why and when the government is deciding to use these funds. This will also follow the use of advice from the Commonwealth's expert on natural disaster management, the director-general of Emergency Management Australia. Being in that position the director-general is well suited, and one might even say highly qualified, for this role. They are in charge of coordination of all kinds of support toward the citizens of our community, be it physical or financial. And all financial decisions will comply with what the Commonwealth has set out in its rules and guidelines for all procedures on grants and resource gathering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The emergency minister will work closely with the director-general of Emergency Management when devising new methods and ways to combat the destruction of natural disasters. Their collaboration will bring about good use of the new funds available to the emergency services. It is through their highly cohesive coordination that the information will be available to the public, being as transparent as possible. Any use of the emergency fund will be published on the website of the Department of Home Affairs and stated in the annual report of those officesâthough, of course, in the case of privacy, individual names and the purpose of the payment will not be publishedâand published not only on the website of the Department of Home Affairs but also on the GrantConnect website, within 21 days of being claimed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recipients of these funds can be anyone affected by natural disasters in an adverse way: individuals; incorporated or unincorporated bodies; not-for-profit organisations; educational institutions, such as universities; and state and territory governments and local government bodies. In the case of natural disasters, we are all affected and we all need to look out for each other. Thus, these funds are available to an extensive range of our population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude, it would be remiss of me not to comment on the previous speaker, who spent 29Â½ minutes talking about education and literally 30 seconds talking about assisting our emergency services in times of a natural disaster. It is disappointing that the Labor Partyâor, indeed, that member of the Labor Partyâtreats our emergency services in this fashion. I hope other speakers from the Labor Party spend more time talking about how we can assist emergency services rather than making erroneous political points about education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will provide funding to the areas in the emergency services that truly need it. They will provide funding to all emergency services and the responses they provide. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Sydney. The member for Sydney has pointed out correctly the flaws in the government's approach, which go to the flaws in this government's approach post 18 May. They were successful in being re-elected to office. But it was like the most surprised people in the country were they themselves, because they, on the government benches, continue to act like an opposition in exile. They continue to sit down in their strategy and tactics meetings and, surprisingly, announce to the public that the objective of any particular sitting of parliament isn't to advance the national interest. The objective is not to promote legislation; it's to promote 'wedgislation'âit's about trying to find legislation that the Labor Party will oppose. This is a great example of it. It's a government really in search of an agenda and a plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, like in too many weeks in this country, we unfortunately are reminded of the crises that occur with regard to natural disasters. Bushfires, floods and cyclones impact far too regularly on Australian citizens and on communities. What that requires is sober and mature leadership from government. What we had from the Prime Minister yesterday on the floor of this parliament was something that I haven't seen before. The Prime Minister rose in response to a Dorothy Dix question from his own side and sought to politicise the response to the natural disasters that occurred when we were in government: the floods in Queensland and the bushfires in Victoria. People died in those disasters. The impact was devastating. Towns like Kinglake virtually disappeared. Floods in Brisbane and in other parts of Queensland had a devastating impact. For the Prime Minister to have tried to seek political advantage, at a time when there are bushfires raging in northern New South Wales and Queensland, was quite extraordinary. It showed that there is no limit to how low this Prime Minister is prepared to go in order to seek political advantage. But it did something more than that. This legislation, the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, highlights yet again that, in spite of the fact that we on this side of the House have indicated very clearly that we will be a constructive oppositionâfor example, I want to be known as the Labor leader, not the opposition leaderâand that we will put our hands across the table on issues of national importance in order to secure outcomes in the national interestâI mean, everyone supports a response to natural disasters and increased assistance. It is appropriate. There's no issue there. But, with this legislation, the government has linked emergency responses to an Education Investment Fund that's about higher education infrastructure. There's no link between the two whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government wanted to have funding, of whatever levelâand I say that with some trepidation. Oh, the shadow Treasurer isn't here, which is good, so I can say this! Any level of funding that the government wants to put into an emergency response, we will do. Appropriationâbang, straight through. That's not in question here. That's not in question. But why is it that, in order to fund drought relief, you have to take $3.9 billion away from infrastructure funding now in order to give $100 million back in two years time, and, in this case, take $4 billion from the Education Investment Fund so that $150 million per year, at a maximum, can be provided to fund recovery measures? That's $4 billion out and $150 million back in. I know they have difficulty judging whether emissions are going up or down, but these are pretty simple figures: $4 billion versus $150 million. So the level of the support is one issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ERF also supplements the assistance that's already there for the communityâthe disaster recovery funding arrangements, including the Australian government disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance. There has been longstanding and genuine bipartisan support for these programs from the Commonwealth and state, territory and local governments, with the funding relationships dependent on the nature of the disaster. So it's quite extraordinary that the government have linked the two things rather than dealt with the issue on its merits. It's also extraordinary that they've restricted it to up to $150 million, given the amount they're taking out of the Education Investment Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should remember, of course, that they also tried to link both the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund to the National Disability Insurance Scheme and a range of other things. But, if you don't support getting rid of funds that are there to build infrastructureâbased upon rigorous processes, including Infrastructure Australia's approval for the Building Australia Fund, and the rigorous processes in place for the Education Investment Fund to make sure it goes to projects that make a real difference to people's livesâthen that wouldn't be appropriate. So there is that issue. The other thing that's extraordinary about this is that it only allows for funding of mitigation infrastructure after a disaster has occurred. Now, that's not mitigation. By definition, that's not mitigation. So the very design of the fund appears wholly inadequate to ensure that there's sufficient focus on making the investments that are needed to properly prepare communities for disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 the Productivity Commission reported to this government that the current intergovernmental arrangements that determine the extent to which the Commonwealth, states and territories each contribute to disaster are contributing to poor outcomes when it comes to rebuilding communities. That was a recommendation in the Productivity Commission report. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A major problem is that the arrangements are highly prescriptive, with funding only provided to restore assets to their pre-disaster standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This makes it difficult for state and local governments to rebuild assets in a way that improves resilience to future disasters â¦</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By subsidising recovery, the arrangements can also discourage states from undertaking mitigation or taking out insurance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The governmentâthis third-term governmentâhas had this report for four years but still has not dealt with any of this in this legislation, despite the fact that the PC report is very clear.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I indicate from personal experience the difference that this can make. This is something that came out of the floods when we were in office and I was the infrastructure minister. I pay tribute to the member for Kennedy. Whilst I have some differences with him from time to time, he is a genuine advocate for his local community. At the time the towns of Karumba and Normanton in the gulf were cut off, as they were regularly. Every time there was a natural disaster in that part of the world, those towns would be cut off, food would be flown in and hospital services would be done by air at an enormous cost. Then they would build the same bridge that was washed away in the flood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We provided, through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, $31.5 million to permanently fix the issue of the Einasleigh River Bridge. We did that through local government. Not only did the local government do it on budget and on time; they came back to us and said that they had done it with about $14 million left over from the funding that was granted to them. That was because they had local knowledge, local suppliers and local workers fixing a local problem. So we said to them, 'You can build another couple of bridges as well to really fix all of the problems around.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was something that didn't fit in with any of the arrangements that were there in terms of natural disaster relief. It was funded through the department of infrastructure and through local government directly. It has made an enormous difference. That one-off investment saved money. That's the key. If you raise a levee in places, as we did in Roma, Charleville and Launceston, through that one-off capital expenditure you actually save money on an ongoing basis.</span>

                    </a>  And that is called mitigation. That's how you fix it, as the member for Paterson knows. But what we have here is legislation that abolishes the Education Investment Fund. There is no linkage there whatsoever. It undermines education infrastructure in this country. It's a very sensible program, as the member for Sydney has pointed out. You have $4 billion taken away, but a maximum of just $150 million in any year put back. You have it done after, not before, there's a natural disaster, so it's not mitigation. How do you come up with this? You'd only come up with this if you were thinking: 'They weren't prepared to abolish these funds to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We'll link it to natural disasters.' These issues should not be the subject of partisan politics; they should be the subject of the national interestâthat's what should matterâand they should be supported by everyone in this House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear: the Labor Party, just like with the drought fund, is not going to be against emergency responses and providing extra funds. But we do say that the government have time to think about getting this right. We won't oppose these bills in the House, but there is time in the Senate to examine the natural disaster recovery arrangements that are in place, to improve them and to make a positive difference, if that's their priority. They also have the capacity, if they're not against investing in education infrastructure, to provide an appropriation in a sensible way which treats it on its merits. If they do not do that, are they saying that emergency responses are not worthy of funding in their own right? I say they are. Labor says they are. Labor will treat this on its merits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the government: stop playing politics with everything, stop doing short-term tactics, stop thinking before every parliamentary week, 'How can we provide tests for Labor?' and start thinking about acting like a government that is in its third term and faces real challenges dealing with the economy, climate change and energy, and the decline in living standards. Real challenges are occurring, as we're hearing before the aged-care royal commission and, starting today, the disability royal commission. Real challenges require a mature response from a government that is in its third term. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise in support of these bills today, the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, and to speak on the bills and the associated amendment. But, before I get into the substance of these bills, I have a few words on the speeches we have just heard from the Labor opposition. So far from Labor on these particular bills we had a 30-minute dissertation on education from the member for Sydney. Then the member for Grayndler came into this House and, after his first sentence saying he didn't want to play politics with this issue, he spent the next 15 minutes playing politics. That's exactly what the Leader of the Opposition was doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand why these bills are so confusing for the Labor members opposite. It's about a solid economic principle that seems to elude the Labor Partyâthat is, putting aside money for a rainy day, literally, to make sure that, when these disasters happen, when unexpected events occur, you can fund it. The point that the Prime Minister was making in question time yesterday is a valid oneâthat, if we remember the last time they were in government, the Labor Party never found a dollar that they didn't want to spend immediately, and, as a result, when disasters occurred, they looked into the tin to provide disaster response and the tin was bare, so they had to introduce a levy. They couldn't even manage a budget properly enough to respond to the natural events that occur in our nation without having to put on an extra tax. That's the point that the Prime Minister was making yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a different approachâthat's not playing politics; it is a simple statement of factâwhen it comes to managing natural disasters and managing a budget, making sure that we manage the budget and the economy appropriately and put aside a little bit of money, because we know that we are indeed a land of drought and flooding rain, sometimes simultaneously, and we will need to respond to these disasters. The last thing we need to do when we respond to these disasters is to introduce a new tax. That's why this legislated fund that we are going to have here at the ready to respond to natural disasters is so important. I'm going to start my speech where the member for Grayndler should have started hisâby acknowledging that we have natural disasters occurring at the moment, particularly in my state of Queensland but also in neighbouring New South Wales. We have many communities facing challenges, but we have, thankfully, many community volunteers who are rising to that challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to start by acknowledging every Australian who is currently giving up their time to help fight these firesâthe firefighters, the Rural Fire Service, the SES, volunteer groups like Rotary and Lions, and everyday Australians who are selflessly donating goods and in some cases opening up their own homes to those who cannot return to their own homes. I'd also like to pay tribute to my colleagues the member for Maranoa and the member for Wright and other colleagues who are engaged on the ground with these volunteers and with emergency services to help their communities. As the Prime Minister said when he visited those impacted in Canungra in Queensland last Friday, these natural disasters always have the most terrible impacts but they bring out the best in Australians in every way. Too true! We are a country that pitches in when the going gets tough. We help our neighbours and our community. People who were once strangers become friends and rely on each other within a matter of hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's with this in mind today that I'm very pleased to support the substance of these bills from the government. These bills seek to deliver a $4 billion future fund that will help people get back on their feet faster. We need to prioritise rebuilding communities as soon as possible, and not only rebuilding them like they were but ensuring that they are stronger and more resilient. Australians will always bounce back, bigger and better, and the Morrison government is committed to supporting them to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This funding needs to be available and sustainable, which is why this fund is so important. Establishing the Emergency Response Fund will enable us to provide an additional source of sustainable funding for emergency response. Creating this fund through legislation means that the fund will always be available when it is needed. This is planning for the future. It's a long-term commitment in the area of disaster recovery. In an instance where a natural disaster occurs and the existing recovery programs and resources need to be buttressed to meet the scale of support and assistance needed, we will be able to access the Emergency Response Fund. The government is already doing a lot of work in this space. There are existing disaster recovery programs which are well-placed and are currently managing disasters, and they will continue to do that. But this funding will be drawn upon when the extent of the disaster exceeds the serviceability of our current programs so that our communitiesâAustralians on the ground dealing with these issuesâare never left wanting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Emergency Response Fund will provide grants and other funding arrangements to support affected communities. It's critical in these times of need that communities, towns and families can return to a level of normality as soon as possible. That's been my experience with these disasters, and I'll speak to that in just a moment. That fund will mean that, in the event of a catastrophe, money can be made available to rebuild vital infrastructure, including roads and local amenities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the backbone of many of the communities impacted by disaster is small businesses. Many of these will be our primary producers. This fund will be able to support local industry to get back on their feet by helping them access economic aid packages or by utilising technologies that can assist. Importantly, these funds can also be used for us to better prepare for extreme events, improving planning for how we can best deal with the impacts if they occur. Advice on our varying climates, future risks and help in preparing can literally be lifesaving. We are committing to making sure we give people who are living and working in these areas of risk access to every tool possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly passionate about these bills because I am a Queenslander. Queenslanders know all too well what it is to face a natural disaster. In the last two years alone we've had the Mareeba and Tablelands bushfires, the Gympie bushfires, the Wide Bay and Burnett severe storms, the Central Queensland bushfires, the Redland bushfires, Tropical Cyclone Owen, the south-west Queensland trough, Tropical Cyclone Penny, North and Far North Queensland monsoon troughs, severe Tropical Cyclone Trevor and the southern Queensland upper-level troughâand that's not to mention the fires that we're facing at the moment, which I've already spoken about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it really hits home when you have to deal with this in your own patch. Perhaps the House will indulge me while I tell a short story. When I was six months into my job as a local councillor, which I ended up doing for almost nine years, we had the 2011 Brisbane flood. This was a devastating and catastrophic event for my local constituency. It was a surreal event in many ways, because it was under clear blue skiesâno rain at all, at that pointâbut the water rose up, and kept rising out of the Brisbane River, and swamped houses with mud and grime. I was cut off from my own home. I slept in my office for a number of days to make sure that I could be on hand to help my constituents. With the predicted flood level changing by the hour, and having to respond to those different flood levels and focus on which residents needed to evacuate and which residents needed to prepare, I will never forget, in a suburb of urban Brisbane, getting into an SES boat and boating across the roofs of houses in my electorate so that I could reach homes that were cut off and needed to be evacuated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, the damage bill was some $2.83 billion. Three-quarters of the council areas within the state of Queensland were declared disaster zones. The flood peaked at 4.46 metres. Just to give you an idea, Suncorp Stadium filled with over two metres of water. And, as I said, in the Ryan electorate, areas such as Moggill and Pullenvale were cut off completely and started to run low on supplies such as water and food. This is in urban Brisbane, just to give you the scaleâhow quickly it can happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But our community is so resilient. As the water levels dropped, the army of volunteers rose up and did what Australians do bestâpitch in. The 'mud army' worked as one to help those residents in need, in some cases clearing and stripping houses down to the studs. In one way, the clear-up was actually the easy partâthere were a lot of people to helpâalthough it was incredibly heartbreaking. The hard part is rebuilding. This is a 12- to 24-month process in which people have to deal with insurers and public bodies to rebuild the infrastructure that's needed. We were able to work hands-on with residents as they needed help. But, as a local councillor and a member of the civic cabinet, I can say that at the same time we were struggling with how to rebuild vital public infrastructure, how to access the funds we needed from the federal government and how to rebuild in a way that improved flood resilience. Red tape, the burden of restrictions, the time it tookâthese are all things that matter in the recovery of a disaster event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that having this fund at the ready, legislated and ready to go, will help to reduce the bureaucracy and get funding to emergency services and into communities more quickly so that the recovery process can be shorter. This is so vital. Speed is vital after one of these events. Residents, councils and communities need to get back to normal. They need that sense of normalcy as soon as possible after an event. That's what impacts how quickly a community can rebound. That's what impacts how quickly an economy recovers and how the mental health and welfare of residents faresâit is speed. I'm passionate about this fund because it will ensure that funding is available quickly for these kinds of disasters when it is needed. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this fund is the type of thing that you achieve when you are strong managers of an economy, when you know what it is to manage a budget well so that you can save for future disasters and have the funds at the ready. It's a pleasure to commend the bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I come into this place at the start of each day fairly calm, focused and willing to be reasonable. But it only takes listening to one or two speakers opposite for my blood to be boiling about the games that get played about things that are so fundamental. There is no doubt that we support the principle of additional natural disaster funding. There can be no doubt about that. What is disappointing is to see that those opposite feel the need to play off the need for additional funding against the need for investment in education infrastructure. We should be at a point in this country whereâguess whatâwe can do both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also spoken multiple times already in the last couple of weeks about the extraordinary efforts that are being made by volunteers and our emergency services personnel. As someone who comes from what's been described as possibly the most fire-prone place on the planet, I absolutely understand how important getting this right is. We not only do fires in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury; we do flood too. So getting this right is fundamental for the future of my community. I'd remind those opposite that at times they're not quite so supportive of our emergency services personnel. I seem to recall them describing our Victorian firefighters as union thugs. So how about we all think about what the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 are about and try to get these bills right rather than play politics with them?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms TEMPLEMAN:</span>
                    </a>  It would be a change. It is a fundamental responsibility of government to protect Australians, to make sure they are supported when they're faced with emergencies and natural disasters and to properly fund relief efforts when those disasters hit. But this Liberal government failed miserably to do that in 2013 when, on the day homes were burning down in the Blue Mountains, it changed the funding arrangements so that people isolated from their homes or experiencing severe power shortages couldn't access emergency payments. It changed the criteria. If your home was destroyed or damaged, or you were injured, you could access the immediate payment, but not if you were in any other sort of disadvantage because of the bushfires. It was a heartless decision, and it impacted many people in Winmalee, Yellow Rock, Springwood and Mount Victoria six years ago. It leaves me just a tad sceptical about the legislation that we're considering today. So I think it's incumbent upon us all to try and get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My view isn't helped by the lack of federal infrastructure investment in our community, or any investment for that matter, following the fires. My street and many others still bear the scars of cars that burnt to the bitumen. For six years, the marks from where my car and my neighbours' cars were destroyed are a still-present reminder of the more than a dozen houses that were lost in our street. One of the reasons for that is that funding for the clean-up and the restoration of services after a bushfire is an expensive business. Our councils didn't have spare funds lying around, and state governmentsâcertainly in New South Walesâhave been reluctant to provide additional funding beyond the immediate response. This federal government has done very little in supportâno boosting of local government funding for this specific purpose. What's more, in the six years since our fires, it's hard to pinpoint anything the federal government has done to help us or the wider Blue Mountains community be more prepared and better equipped to deal with any repeat of the 2013 bushfires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is entirely appropriate that these bills be sent to a Senate inquiry for closer examination, because there are a number of issues that they raise for me. One is the role of the federal government in natural disaster and emergency response funding. Is it preparedness, mitigation, adaptation or simply relief following a disaster, or is it all of those? My underlying concern with these bills, as they're written, is that they ignore the recommendations of the Productivity Commission that the federal government should be primarily focused on mitigation, and that comes with a pretty hefty price tag. Another concern is the appropriateness of this mechanism, a fund essentially outsourced to the market with a specific amount allowed to be used each year: $150 billion. There are many, many questions that raises. My third concern is that we need to look at the consequences of this approach for the insurance industry and whether we are in some way letting them off the hook. How does this intersect with their responsibilities? So these are some of the issues I want to touch on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we have to address the issue that the government's choosing to take money from higher education to fund this. I feel very cynical about this chess move. While the rainforests are burning in Queensland and New South Wales and people are feeling the heat from the unseasonally early bushfires, this government's sneaking around with a tricky move, as if it's been waiting for the perfect conditions in which to bring this legislation on. Fancy someone saying to you: 'You can have an investment in university or TAFE, or you can have disaster and emergency relief fundingâone or the other. You choose.' In fact, if this were a decent government, a government that wasn't slippery, we wouldn't be making that choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about this fund. The explanatory memorandum talks about a lot of things that this fund is for: mitigation and emergency relief. The minister says that the design of the disaster response and recovery funding programs will be informed by advice from the director-general of Emergency Management Australia, but there is no mention of the work that the Productivity Commission did. It's basically been ignored. The Turnbull government rejected a call for a $200 million-a-year natural disaster mitigation fund. That was just mitigation, and that's well above the $150 million that this government says it will allow to be drawn out of this fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission argued that investing in mitigation and preparedness was more efficient than spending money on recovery. It just makes common sense to be able to invest and prepare, rather than wait for it to happen. Yet none of the funding from this fund, from what we've been able to see, will be available prior to a disaster. You have to have had a disaster to be able to prepare for one. That is illogical and definitely needs to be looked at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government responded to the Productivity Commission's recommendations, the then minister said that mitigation was the states' problem. I think those questions really need to be cleared up: what is this fund going to be used for, and what does 'post-disaster resilience' really mean? It's defined in a subclause. It's a shoddy piece of legislation without clarity around those really key issues. Are you telling me that in the Blue Mountains we could have used this fund for the suburbs that were hit in the 2013 bushfiresâbut what about the rest of the towns and suburbs of the Blue Mountains? Does Wentworth Falls miss out and does Warrimoo miss out, because they haven't had a fire in the last six years? When does it have to have happened? Is 2013 too long ago, and is the lower Blue Mountains excluded from this effort as well? They're some of the issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My cynicism comes from my lived experience of this government. There was a fantastic program developed by Gateway Family Services in Blaxland to help community services respond to a disaster, to help them prepare to respond to a disaster in their own communities. Community service organisations play a huge role when these things happen, yet they themselves are often not well prepared. The people who developed the Walk With program, developed by Gateway Family Services, said they did it because it would have helped them so much to have all the information, ideas, models and evidence in one place, in one program, to tap into. So they went out and developed this resource. That was thanks to a small amount of funding from the New South Wales government. But that funding's run out, and there is nothing from this government that would allow that program to continue. There is nothing that would allow Gateway Family Services to continue training up other community groups around the country and providing a resource that, today, could have been accessed by people in northern New South Wales and Queensland. They're the sorts of things that are an infrastructure of a different kind, and I'm interested to see whether this fund will stretch to those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at the things that can be funded, I'm interested to see that this fund talks not only about tailored financial assistance to help people and organisations recover and build economic sustainability and resilience but also about primary producers or small businesses. Does that extend to home-based businesses? In the 2013 fires many of our businesspeople who worked from home were completely excluded from any sort of support. So does this have a different set of rules? And what does it do for horticultural businesses that naturally get wiped out in bushfire situations? It also talks about economic aid packages, and, I can tell you, these are desperately needed. The tourism community of the Blue Mountains desperately needed supportâon the one hand, to describe where tourism wasn't affected, and, on the other, to quickly let people know when things were back to normal. In principle, those things sound terrific, but, with the limit of $150 million a year that has been put on it, I just don't see how you can do all the things that need to be done. That $150 million won't be reviewed for 10 years, so we're stuck with this limitâthis false limit, unless there's a basis for it. But the legislation doesn't indicate any way in which this figure has been arrived at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, all of these things raise big questions about the actual operation of the fund. I have to say that I'm not filled with confidence that the amount is sufficient, particularly with the likelihood of increased unpredictable weather events as a consequence of climate change. I note that this mentions the issues of adaption, tools to better understand local climate variability and advice on climate risk applied to specific locations for future land use planning. I can see that there is some suggestion in here that this is possibly part of adaption, but what happens when the $150 million runs out? Assuming this runs for the July to June financial year, what happens if it runs out in September, or October, or January or April? What happens for a natural disaster in May? These are the sorts of questions this government needs to talk throughâneeds to explain if it already has answersâand find answers so that we are designing something that will meet the needs of communities like mine, who have been through this and know that we will go through it again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue relates to where this money is coming from. To take away money from education is a pretty heartless thing to do. We talk about long-term investmentâI'm sure I hear those opposite talk about being sensible, long-term investorsâyet I see absolutely no evidence of it. Labor established the Education Investment Fund so that we could invest the capital necessary for Australia's future. This government continues to fail to invest in the infrastructure and human capital needed in education so that we have growth across all our societyânot so that those who already have can have more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EIF was a key plank in our move to transform Australia's education and research capability and to address the years of underinvestment that happened during the Howard years. By nearly doubling the former Higher Education Endowment Fund, we were able to broaden and make substantial investment in the renewal and refurbishment of universities and vocational institutions, as well as major research institutions. As the member whose electorate houses Western Sydney University, I know that those facilities always need upgrading. Our TAFEs need improvement. We have wonderful opportunities for horticulture, for really clever stuff that would allow us to be exporting to niche markets in Asia, yet our TAFE has a glasshouse that is decades old and doesn't meet the standards that employers would expect for people to be trained in. So there is a huge need for this sort of investment. During the last election, I was very pleased to be able to commit funding to upgrade Richmond TAFE's greenhouses to make them state-of-the-art. It's very disappointing that this government won't be doing the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision by this government to take money from one sector to give to a very needy sector is a cynical exercise. It isn't too much to ask that governments provide much-needed financial assistance to communities affected by emergencies and natural disasters to help them to recover and be resilient, and, more importantly, to help them to prepare for and mitigate natural disasters. But they should also be able to fund investment in infrastructure. We should be funding both. It is extremely disappointing to see that this government is incapable of walking and chewing gum at the same time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  The bushfire danger season usually doesn't begin until October but, as communities in northern New South Wales and Queensland know too well right now, emergencies aren't predictable. They can affect any community and they have no respect for whether or not people are prepared for the damage that they will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, don't prevent natural disasters. They can't restore the homes in Queensland, rewind the clock or give people back what they've lost. But they can make a very important declaration and provide assistance to people suffering the consequences of natural disasters today and those who will experience them in the future. They say that all of Australia is with you, we're prepared to support you and communities will be supported to recover when natural disasters hit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This season is anticipated to be one of the worst in recent history. In my home state of New South Wales, 21 areas have been listed as bushfire danger zones. In 74 local government areas across our state, including the two that cover my electorate, the bushfire danger period has been brought forward with the recognition that conditions are extremely dangerous this year. The bushfire season is expected to go on for at least six months. For communities in northern New South Wales and other parts of the country, where drought has now turned into fire, these emergencies are adding further salt into the wounds for people who are at their wit's end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know too well that summer in Australia is not just about beaches and holidays. For communities that live in or on the edges of our beautiful bushland, summer involves apprehension. Children learn to notice the smell of smoke and join in the yearly rituals of cleaning gutters and clearing branches. This is part of life in Australia. Fortunately, another part of life in Australia is community spirit and the volunteerism we see displayed continually by the men and women who serve in the Rural Fire Service and the State Emergency Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak about the detail of the bills, I want to say a few things about emergency management in my part of the country and talk about the way in which the RFS and SES particularly are serving our communities. In the electorate of Berowra there are 23 Rural Fire Service brigades that stretch from Sackville North in the west to Brooklyn in the east, and from Wisemans Ferry in the north down to Westmead and Hornsby in the south. These brigades run on the goodwill of local volunteers who give up substantial time and risk their own lives to support their neighbours. Cherrybrook Rural Fire Brigade has been led by Gavin Pringle and Stacey Fishwick. There are volunteers that work hard each summer to protect the homes and lives of people either in our community or in communities further afield. The Rural Fire Service held their Get Ready Weekend just a few days ago. If the Cherrybrook Rural Fire Brigade is anything to go by, then the community are more alert this year to threat of fire than they have been in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to visit the station on Saturday with my family, along with a steady stream of other families who attended, not just to look at the fire trucks but to learn how to prepare our properties and families for the summer season. A key lesson of the weekend was that thinking about having a fire plan is not the same as having a fire plan. Families need to prepare their homes but they also need to prepare for what they will do when a fire comes. Will they stay or will they go? How will they make those decisions and ensure that they act safely when they do? Families need to talk about these options, make decisions and write down their plans so that they can action them when the time comes that they need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a sense, the bills we're discussing are the government's get-ready plan. It's how we're preparing and putting aside resources so that we can respond quickly and effectively when we need to. It is not just fire that we need to be conscious of at this time of the year. As people in my electorate know, fire is not the only type of disaster that can destroy homes and devastate communities. The fire season is also the storm season. The SES are also campaigning alongside the RFS for people to get ready for other natural disasters we'll see, like storms, floods and heavy winds. Again, families and businesses need to know the risk, develop a plan for what to do, prepare property, be aware and look out for each other.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, on 15 December, severe storms hit our district causing power outages, destroying cars, damaging homes and knocking down trees. Five days later another storm hit, this time even more intensively, in the suburbs of Berowra, Cowan and Berowra Heights. Strangely shaped, spiky hailstones bigger than the size of cricket balls smashed through metal and pummelled roof tiles. In a matter of minutes, millions of dollars worth of property was destroyed, some of which still waits for repair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Insurance Council of Australia has told me that the clean-up bill for the Berowra hailstorms was larger than the clean-up bill for the entire Townsville storms. The emergency services were incredible. It's estimated that over nine days, including Christmas Day, at least 23,000 volunteer hours were given to help people in the immediate aftermath. The SES led the response and in that time they responded to 1,395 jobs in Berowra, Berowra Heights and Cowan. There were 450 SES personnel on the field and they used 2,000 tarps. Berowra Village Tavern fed over 300 lunches to emergency service workers on Christmas Eve. The RFS partnered with the SES to make a substantial contribution to the response. At the peak of the operations, on 22 December the New South Wales RFS deployed six strike teams, consisting of 58 vehicles and 216 personnel. Over nine days, 146 vehicles and 615 personnel were used.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Impact Volunteering is a terrific organisation in Dunkley that supports volunteers and volunteering across the area. Every year they award the Impact Volunteering Volunteer of the Year Award. This year at the mayor's picnic the absolutely worthy recipient was Donna Cartright from Mums Supporting Families in Need. The hours and work that Donna has put into this organisation are incalculable, as is the support that Mums Supporting Families in Need have given to some of the neediest families so that every child can have material necessities. She and her organisation are worthy recipients. I know that Donna, who is a humble and hardworking woman, would be very happy for me to say that the award that she received reflects the amazing team that she also has around her.</span>

Ian Cuthbertson from the Australian Radio Rescue Service got the senior award, and Hannah Swinnerton, a young woman who turned personal disadvantage and adverse circumstances into a campaign to help other young people with Speak Up for Change, won the youth category. Congratulations. You are very worthy recipients. Everyone in Dunkley is very proud of you.</span>

I had the great pleasure of visiting them on the weekend and handing out trophies to some of their young soccer superstars. It was a great afternoon, filled with entertainment, food and drink. It had a really family-friendly atmosphere. With over 600 boys and girls playing at the club, it's going from strength to strength under club president Phil.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significant improvements are already underway. They've got a brand-new shed and a renovated kitchen. Brand-new change rooms are currently being built. The block of four change rooms is a result of two years of planning, fundraising and consultation by Phil and the club executive. It was a highlight for me earlier in the year to announce a $500,000 federal grant to go towards this project to make the new change rooms a reality. The wait is almost over, with construction on the change rooms to be complete in the next two weeks. I got a sneak peek of them, as the tiling was going down. I tell you what, these are some schmick facilities. The kids are going to be absolutely delighted with them. They will have a modern, clean and safe facility to use.</span>

It's a vibrant, diverse and bustling region of Australia. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all the finalists in the Western Sydney Awards for Business Excellence. I was lucky to form part of the judging panel this year, so I saw firsthand just how amazing so many of these businesses are. The awards were founded by the Parramatta Chamber of Commerce in 1990, so this is the 29th year of recognising outstanding business leaders and organisations that are actively contributing to the Western Sydney region's rapidly developing economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Special congratulations must go to all the winners, as well as to all those who were nominated, who have achieved great things not only personally but also for Parramatta and the wider community. In particularâand I do this at great risk to life and limbâI'd like to commend two local organisations that are very dear to my heart. The first is the National Theatre of Parramatta. It is a recent addition to Parramatta, but a national theatre nonetheless that produces extraordinary work. It was awarded the Commonwealth Bank prize for excellence in arts and culture. We are a richer community because of their presence. They are wonderful at telling our local stories.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to commend a local not-for-profit that's very close to my heartâthe Michael Hughes Foundation. In fact, they're close to everybody's heart. They've been working tirelessly now for a number of years to make defibrillators, and the capacity to use them, standard in our community. They're doing an amazing job. They won the Dooleys Lidcombe Catholic Club award for excellence in social enterprise. Congratulations to everyone. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In honour of Father's Day, I ran the Forde's Fantastic Fathers competition to get the children of Forde to nominate their fathers to receive an award and recognition. This award recognises the outstanding contribution of fathers and the impact they can have on their families and their children. I was pleased to receive over 50 nominations from children across the electorate. It was truly humbling to read their nominations and the wonderful stories they told about their fathersâstories like those from Alexis, whose father is described as a warrior, or from Eddie, who nominated his dad because he can simply make funny faces. Whatever their stories may be, our fathers are truly special and it is important that we regularly remind them of that. As a father to two fine young men, I can confidently say it gives me great joy when my kids show appreciation to their dad. I have great pride in being their father. I acknowledge and congratulate all the fathers nominated for all they do for their families, but in the end there could be only one winner. I was proud to present the award to Ryan, a local father in Eagleby who moved from Wales to Queensland for the terrific weather and happily found love here. His nomination stood out to me because a father doesn't necessarily have to be someone who is forced by DNA but someoneâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Chifley is home to many people who hail from the Pacific Islands, including nearly 2,500 Tongan Australiansâthe most of any electorate in Australia. Today I acknowledge that many from Tonga will be mourning the passing of Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pohiva, and I stand with them at this time. Having served in the Tongan parliament for over 30 years, Mr Pohiva had been his country's Prime Minister for the past five years. He was the first commoner in Tonga to be elected to this high office. He was one of the country's longest serving parliamentarians, a prime minister who dedicated his life to the service of his country. He spoke strongly on confronting the challenge of climate change and he continued this advocacy for Tonga, despite his ill health, at the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. His country's democratic evolution towards constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy will be among his legacies. I would make this remark: if we recognise the importance of our Pacific neighbours to this nation, we should extend respect to our Tongan friends during this difficult time by formally acknowledging his passing via a condolence motion in this chamber. It is the right thing to do to for our Tongan friends. Vale, Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pohiva.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I rise to talk today about the health safety issues of button batteries. As a trainee doctor I would get chills down my spine if I got a call from the emergency department that we had a button battery case. In Australia there are 20 such cases each week. Babies see button batteries as bright, shiny, fun things to put in their mouth and swallow. As doctors we saw them as exploding time bombs that, if swallowed, stick in the throat and, if not removed, eventually erode a hole in the baby's oesophagus and aorta, resulting in catastrophic bleeding and, all too often, a tragic and unexpected death. As a mother of four, I know how hard it is to monitor every little object crawling babies put in their mouths. Last week I met with Alison, who, tragically, lost her daughter Bella in these awful circumstances. There is no word to describe the loss of a child, and Alison is doing all that she can to make sure no other parent suffers the tragedy that has so deeply affected her, her husband, her family and indeed the whole community. Protective regulations such as adding a bitterant coating to all button batteries so that babies spit out the battery, rather than swallow it, should be legislated and monitored across all products that contain button batteriesâin particular, toys. There is now an urgent need to increase product safety at the legislative level to stop unsafe products, both domestic and from overseas, from entering the marketplace.</span>

I was proud to have the opportunity to say thank you to these volunteers for the work they do and present national medals, long-service medals and clasps to some very worthy recipients. Medals and clasps were presented in recognition of years of diligent service, as well as for those who go above and beyond for the benefit of our community. Amazingly, the recipients represented over 1,000 years of combined serviceâa gigantic effort and worthy of celebration. 'Thank you' hardly seems enough for the work you do. Thank you to Shoalhaven City Council for hosting such a terrific event. I also want to again thank all the amazing RFS and SES volunteers for everything they do for our community.</span>

Sixty to 70 per cent of Australian adolescents have gambled. Tragically, they are four to six times more likely to become problem gamblers, leading in too many cases to a lifetime spiral of debt, poverty, homelessness, broken relationships, and mental and physical health problems. Forty-four per cent of children aged between nine and 16 report that they have encountered sexual images online. Research shows this premature exposure can have a terrible and permanent impact on their attitudes to sex, sexuality and relationships. We must stop children from accessing this material and let kids be kids. While online, gambling customers must verify their age within 14 days to retain access. No age verification process whatsoever is required for individuals to access online pornography.</span>

I invite people to put in submissions by 25 October.</span>

Indeed, just this week there's been a Chinese government-backed $1.5 billion takeover bid for Tasmanian infant formula business Bellamy's. But already serious questions are being raised about the offer, which comes when Bellamy's has been struggling to secure registration from China to sell its organic products in retail outlets and consequently has seen its company value tumble. The proposed sale must be assessed by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which will need to conduct a most stringent assessment of whether or not the public interest is served by this sale. Many Australians will be uneasy for all sorts of reasons, and it's important that the review board is seen to act quickly and competently and to be prepared to stop the sale if need be. Moreover, there must be no risk for Australian consumers of formula shortages or declining standards. In other words, we don't want supermarket shelves stripped bare, nor do we want the Bellamy's Australian workforce gutted. We must also heed the lessons of history and make sure we don't see a repeat of the farcical Van Diemen's Land Company sale, where foreign buyers promised the world but delivered bugger all. This will be a crucial test for the Foreign Investment Review Board and for the federal governmentâone that both must pass.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  September is NICU awareness month. 'NICU' stands for 'neonatal intensive care unit'. They are specialised units that care for babies born prematurely. One in 10 babies in Australia are born prematurely, or before 37 weeks gestation. Of these, 73 per cent require NICU services. Many families in Mallee have experienced the stress and joy of bringing a premmie into the world. Thirty-five years ago, my husband and I brought a premmie into the world and valued the support we received from the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne. For regional families, distance adds complexity to an already stressful space, and the understanding of NICU professionals makes a big difference in their own ability to adjust to a tiny baby in need of intensive care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The families I have spoken to within Mallee who have needed neonatal intensive care tell me of the support, care and hope they have received in these incredible places. Just yesterday I was talking to a local mum who has needed the care of a NICU twice, with both of her daughters being born before 30 weeks. When she and her husband recount their journey with both girls, they speak of their time in a NICU as something special rather than something that is overwhelming. They said to me that one of the greatest gifts you can give families of critically ill infants is hope: 'Hope in the darkest of hours helped us to endure.'</span>

There is a lot that we argue about in this chamber. But we've agreed today, I think across the board, that we should support communities that are confronted by natural disasters. We've all agreed that we should support those communities. There are other things we agree on in this chamber. We agree that action should be taken to stop the debt trap. We agree on that. The government agrees on that. The Deputy Prime Minister agrees with that. Today we've got Gerard Brody and the Consumer Action Law Centre here in Parliament House, with the Salvos, to talk to us all about this exact issue.</span>

I've spoken about Coast Opera in this place before. I want to again acknowledge that they are the first locally grown opera company on the Central Coast, and they're really doing an outstanding job of bringing world-class and emerging talent to our region. Coast Opera Australia's emerging artist program supports new local talent with opportunities to further their training right across Australia. In the past 12 months Coast Opera has joined John Bell from the Bell Shakespeare Company, for example, to conduct a master class for actors and singers alikeâone of six such master classes conducted in the past year by Coast Opera.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Angela and her team are now planning for the Central Coast's first full-stage operatic performance, which is sure to be a spectacular and incredible night, as well as continuing their involvement with the local community by working in conjunction with the Bouddi Foundation for the Arts to continue with the emerging artists scholarship program. I wish Angela all the best when she represents the Central Coast's artistic community in performing at this year's Melbourne Cup. This is an outstanding achievement for Angela, for Coast Opera and for the Central Coast region. On behalf of our community, I place on record how thrilled we are to have a Central Coast local of Angela's calibre representing us at the race that stops the nation.</span>

But, despite promise after promise by multiple government ministers, including in writing to me by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, this government continues to let the loan sharks do what they please. Earlier today I met with Gerard Brody from the Consumer Action Law Centre and the Stop The Debt Trap Allianceâa coalition of more than 20 consumer advocacy organisations from across this country including financial experts, community advocates and service providers. This alliance has been formed in response to the more than 1,000 days of inaction since the coalition government promised to make reforms. Included in their delegation today is payday lending victim Noorlia, who escaped family violence and was close to being homeless, only to be exploited by the out-of-control payday lending industry and fall into the debt trap, as thousands of people do.</span>

I also want to acknowledge in the House today Mr Tan and Mrs Nga Vu, from the Vietnamese Catholic Community Centre in Inala in my electorate. Earlier this year I took my parliamentary oath on a bible provided by their Catholic church. I want to put on record my sincere thanks and admiration for all they do for our community, and welcome them to the people's House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Last Friday, while visiting the great little mining town of Kambalda, I dropped in to the local swimming pool. The federal government funding committed to the upgrade of Kambalda pool was one of my proudest achievements this year. With the weather starting to warm up, I thought it was time to get an update on the progress of the makeover. Councillor Tracey Rathbone and Community Development Officer Kathy Brooking showed me how things were progressing during my visit last Friday. Although it's taken a little longer than I had hoped, I can assure the community that it will be a fantastic facility and well worth the wait. The Morrison government provided a $287,000 community support and infrastructure grant towards the project, while the Shire of Coolgardie secured a $1.95 million loan through the state Treasury. Following the Morrison government's commitment, the state government came on board with a $700,000 contribution through the Community Sporting and Recreation Facilities Fund, and the Gold Fields Australia Foundation chipped in another $200,000. The combination of this funding will ensure the pool is open as soon as possible so that residents don't have to sweat through another hot summer without their pool.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday, the shire also hosted the annual Coolgardie Day, a celebration of Arthur Bayley registering his claim for himself and William Fordâknown thereafter as 'Bayley's Reward'âon 17 September 1892 at Southern Cross. It was the beginning of the Eastern Goldfields and was to spark the greatest gold rush in Australian history. Thank you and congratulations to all the volunteers involved in making this year's event such a success.</span>

Cafe Sunshine is a social enterprise that provides refugees and asylum seekers with job opportunities. This is particularly important in Sunshine, given the large number of refugees that have made it their home in recent years. The cafe cofounders, Jen Morillas and Hamed Allahyari, previously volunteered with the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and came up with the idea to partner with the ASRC to open the cafe. The cafe also received funding from the Victorian government under the Pick My Project grants program, receiving assistance from Natalie Suleyman in making their application. The cafe serves wonderful Iranian cuisineâand I would like it recorded in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> that I do recommend their baklava! I congratulate Jen and Hamed on the wonderful contribution that their cafe is making to the Sunshine community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  The Bayside Graffiti Management Plan has empowered Goldstein residents to take ownership of the built environment in our wonderful community. Residents, traders groups, Neighbourhood Watch and Victoria Police have come together with Bayside Council to improve the response to graffiti and to transform tagging hotspots into works of art. With the support of a council community grant and Shine Health owner Marta Dunin-Labedzki, a cheerfully technicolour mural now adorns a once unremarkable concrete wall at Black Rock shopping village. The mural was designed and painted by local students and artist Daiana Ingleton, who won the design competition hosted by Black Rock Neighbourhood Watch. Daiana worked on the seven-by-11-metre wall with the help of her peers in year 12 at Sandringham College and local volunteers. The kindergarten co-op in Cheltenham has also commissioned Daiana's mural-painting talents to help bring to life their outdoor friendship square. Community art projects are also underway at the Sandringham skate bowl and the Peterson Youth Centre.</span>

It's programs like these that can make a practical difference to the built environment of the Goldstein communityâenhance it and cherish it for future generations.</span>

Many who have Bupa Aged Care facilities in their electorates would not find the recommendations by the department anything new. Forty-five of the 72 Bupa facilities inspected failed to meet standards, 22 were deemed to place residents at serious risk and 13 were sanctioned. I have one facility in my own electorate, Bendigo, that was issued with a 'serious risk' declaration. I will just read to the House what the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission are saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Following an assessment contact conducted on 6-7 March 2019, a delegate of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner made a decision that Bupa Aged Care Australia Pty Ltd failed to meet three expected outcomes â¦</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />This is putting people at risk, seriously. This is a real problem that's going on in our community, and it's not new. Staff have spoken out about understaffing, the problem of having qualified, trained staff, and being pressured. Families have spoken out about the quality of care because staffing ratios and quotas are not being met, because of lack of training standards and because of the quality of food. Yet all we've had from this government in the last week, since the problem was announced, is not a commitment to restore the funding cut but basic words from the minister: 'We're closely monitoring the situation.' That's the best that they can do for so many people whose lives are at risk. It's unacceptable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On 24 August, the Stanley River Wolves brought home the Sunshine Coast rugby league premiers cup to Longman after a hard-fought game against the Caboolture Snakes, also from the Longman electorate, in the A-grade final at the Sunshine Coast Stadium. With a great season under their belts, both the Wolves and the Snakes played to their strengths on the field, but it was the Wolves who took home the trophy that night, with a score of 28 to 16. The Stanley River Rugby League Football Club, which is based in Woodford, is well known across the Longman community for its family-oriented culture.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As further proof that Longman is truly the rugby league capital of the Sunshine Coast, on the same day the Beachmere Pelicans from Longman defeated the Kilcoy Yowies in the division 2 men's final, and the Beachmere under-18s went down in the grand final. So, out of the four grand finals played, Longman teams were represented in three, bringing home two trophies, which is a tremendous effort indeed. I was privileged to witness both the men's finals and was very proud of the spirit in which they were played. Congratulations to all teams on a great season. Hopefully, we can go back to back in 2020 and the Broncos will do better next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I rise to congratulate the Wentworthville Tamil Study Centre on their annual festival of the arts, also known as Kalai Vizha, held recently in Blacktown, which I had the pleasure of attending. Now in its 31st year, the festival is an amazing celebration of traditional Tamil art forms and an opportunity to showcase the immense talents of the many students enrolled at the centre. Since its inception in 1988, the centre has helped to preserve Tamil culture by educating young Australians in language, dance, music and literature. The centre is one of the largest language schools in New South Wales, with around 800 enrolled students. The passionate staff, students, volunteers and parents who comprise the school community ensure that all Australians can experience and celebrate this beautiful ancient culture. It is truly a privilege to represent such a vibrant community in Western Sydney, including our local Tamil community. The centre's efforts are a unique expression of one of the world's oldest living cultures. It was a humbling experience to enjoy the warm hospitality of the local Tamil community yet again. Congratulations to all involved in the organisation of this year's festival of the arts. It was a great success and a very entertaining afternoon. Vanakkam!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  Each year I organise the North Sydney Community Awards to say thank you to the many volunteers and community organisations that work to make the North Sydney electorate a better, more caring, brighter and safer place to live, raise children and grow old. There are so many people working in our area to help others in need or in support of the community. They never expect an accolade or for their work to be recognised. From those supporting our elderly to bush care groups to volunteers running sporting clubs, literally thousands of people are making a difference in our wonderful part of Sydney. So this is a great opportunity for residents to nominate these unsung heroes, and nominations are now open for the 2019 awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's awards are being held on the evening of 21 November at Norths in Cammeray. There are a variety of categories for the awards so we can recognise all of those who contribute. These include the North Sydney Community Award, which is open to any individual who lives in the local area or works for a North Sydney based community organisation. We also have categories for young people, senior citizens, and organisations making outstanding contributions. This year, for the first time, we will also have presentations from the winners of my North Sydney Speech Writing Competition, who were announced earlier this year. The North Sydney awards are a wonderful celebration of our community, which is so strong, and I look forward to acknowledging those who are nominated for awards during this ceremony.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  I thank the member for Herbert for his question. Like all members of this House who have served their country in uniform, we say to them, 'Thank you for your service.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over six years ago, when this government was elected, we had some difficult challenges and there were things that had to be turned around. There were the terrible failures on border protection that were menacing the country; there was a budget that we'd inherited from the Labor Party that was in complete disrepair; there were emissions reduction profiles that meant we would not meet our Kyoto target for emissions by some 700 million tonnes; and, of course, there was the lowest level of defence spending as a share of GDP since before the Second World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we had the challenge of turning all of this around, preparing the budget and getting the budget back into surplusâwhich it achieves this yearâbut, at the same time, ensuring that we were delivering on the essential services that Australians rely on. We are now at record levels of education and health spending, and fully funding the NDIS. All of these important services are being funded by a budget that is strengthening from year to year. At the same time, we had to make up that massive gap when it came to dealing with the defence capability of this nation. This is a turnaround that saw us set, by 2022-23, a target of two per cent of GDP. I can inform the House that we will achieve that in 2021. When the Treasurer comes to the dispatch box next year, he will be able to make it very clear that we will have met that target three years early to ensure that defence spending as a share of our economy is two per cent of GDP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast, in Labor's last budget, they slashed defence spending by 10.5 per cent. They ripped $18 billion out of the defence budget over the time of their management. You know why they had to do it? They had to do it because they didn't know how to manage money. When you run your budget into disrepair, when you can't keep the course of economic and fiscal management, you can't get the budget back into surplus, you can't meet the needs and you can't ensure that you increase spending to two per cent of GDP.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when there are great threats to Australia and around the world, we have important responsibilities, working with our allies and partners around the world, to do our own heavy lifting. As a result of this government's strong budget management, we're in a position to say that Australia carries its weight on defence and we are meeting the obligations of our alliances, which keep this country safe. And we will continue to do thatâin stark contrast to the budget mismanagement of the opposition when they were in government, which led to the lowest defence spending since prior to the Second World War. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As the Prime Minister has said, pensions are regularly indexed. Indeed, under this government, the amount of money that goes to those on the age pension has increased significantly since we've been in government. Our commitment is to a sustainable social services system. Under the previous Labor government the challenge that we faced was that the social services system was not sustainable. We are determined to make sure that it is sustainable so that the rate of growth of social services spending is less than the rate of growth in tax and revenue.</span>

I know the member for Cowper is genuinely excited about this, because his people told him, in regard to the Coffs bypass, that they wanted tunnels. An environmental impact statement is already out there, and the community is having input into that process. This is, after all, the age of infrastructure. The Coffs Harbour bypass is getting people from the North Coast of New South Walesâindeed, travellers up and down the length and breadth of the Pacific Highwayâto where they need to be, sooner and safer. The bypass that the member for Cowper fought so hard for and that we're delivering is going to have four lanesâtunnels 14 kilometres in length, with 12 sets of traffic lights avoided. As the member for Cowper well knows, it's creating 12,000 jobs in the construction phase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pacific Highway is such a great project. It's one of the biggest projects we've got on the go at the moment, and it's removing thousands of vehicles, especially heavy vehicles, from the central business district of Coffs Harbour. The member for Cowper said recently, when we visited his electorate to launch the EIS: 'This is not just a bypass. It's not just a road. What it's doing is providing, over the period of the build, some 12,000 direct and indirect jobs.' The money goes straight back into the local economy. It provides jobs in the local economy. And the Coffs Harbour mayor, Denise Knight, is also very excited about this prospect. She said, 'We're absolutely thrilled. It's going out to the community'âthat is, the EISâ'so that everybody gets the opportunity to put in their two bob's worth.' Let's remember that this study has been shaped by the people who will be using and benefitting from this bypass each and every day. Community consultation plays an integral role in ensuring we are truly delivering projects that the community wants, needs, expects andâperhaps most importantly, as the member for Cowper knows all too wellâdeserves.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the tunnels. The community called for tunnels to be built into the plans for the bypass, and we're delivering. The three tunnels will feature in the latest design of the bypass, which is what the EIS shows. The EIS is available at local pop-upsâlittle stalls in the Coffs central business district. It's available from state member Gurmesh Singh's electorate office and from the member for Cowper's electorate office, and it's on the RMS website. This is certainty and stability writ large. The Coffs Harbour bypassâwe're getting on and we're building it for the benefit of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:09</span>):  I will ask the Minister representing the minister for social services to add to my answer, but I can tell you what this government does. This government makes sure that the welfare system is fair to those who rely on it and is fair to those who pay for it, which is the taxpayers of Australia. And where there are benefits and supplements to payments that are being paid to people who are having extended absences from Australiaâthey're overseas for long periods of time and they receive supplements to meet expenditures that people are facing at home, not overseasâthen the government will always seek to ensure that these supplements go to those for the purposes they were intended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our government, the welfare bill is not a blank cheque. Under our government, the welfare goes where it is needed and is targeted, and it is done in a sustainable way to ensure that all of those who rely absolutely on the welfare bill of this country can depend on it into the future. And you know what, Mr Speaker? If you can't manage money, if you're a government that doesn't know how to manage money, you can't say to the pensioners of Australia that you can support their pension into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Labor Party, they had to not list medicines. They had to make cuts to defence. They even had to put a flood levy on, because they did not know how to manage money. The Labor Party has to take responsibility for the implications, for the consequences, of their failure to manage money. At the last election, we said, very clearly, 'Labor can't manage money and that means they come after yours.' They will ensure through their mismanagement that Australians miss out, that essential services that Australians rely on can never be guaranteed by the Labor Partyâwhether it's hospitals or schools or the NDIS or aged care. </span>

The member has indicated the <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the ready </span>report, and I acknowledge the work done by her predecessor, Cathy McGowan, on that inquiry. I acknowledge also the then member for Murray, now member for Nicholls, and other members for the input that they had into <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the ready</span>. My department is working very hard on the final response to that important report. It is an important report, and I acknowledge the member's interest in it. She talks about a blueprint for regional Australia, and, yes, on this side we do have a blueprint for the regions, which is more than I can say for those opposite. The Liberals and Nationals continue to fight for a better deal for Australians who do not live in the capital cities, those Australians who choose to invest in the regions. As the Prime Minister knows, when the regions are strong, so too is our nation. As members may recall, and as the member for Indi indicated, on 13 February the government tabled its response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the ready: investing in Australia's future</span>. In response to the report the then Minister for Regional Services, Senator Bridget McKenzie, announced that a regional strategic growth expert panel, as the member indicated, would review the issues raised in <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the ready</span>. The panel delivered its final report in March. The government is incorporating the report's recommendations as part of our broader regional agenda.</span>

He knows about the importance of a strong economy, with 70,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Moore benefiting from tax cuts that this side of the parliament supported and that those opposite called offensive and reckless. Let's remind ourselves about the fiscal and financial mess that we inherited from the Labor Party. In the Labor Party's last budget there was a budget deficit of $48Â½ billion, around three per cent of GDP. In Labor's last year in office 65,000 small businesses closed their doors, unemployment was at 5.7 per cent and the four budget surpluses that chairman Swan promised the Australian people never eventuated, even though the Labor Party had an iron ore price of $185 a tonne, which is more than double of what it is today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we've come to government, we've helped create more than 1.4 million new jobs. We've got employment growth at 2.6 per cent. We've helped maintain our AAA credit rating. The proportion of working age Australians who are on welfare is at the lowest level of any government in 30 years. The real rate of spending growth of the government is now the lowest of any government in 50 years. And we are bringing the budget back into surplus for the first time in 12 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked: are there any alternative approaches? We know that the Labor Party went to the Australian people at the last election with $387 billion of higher taxes. That would have taken the tax-to-GDP ratio to 25.9 per centâthe highest tax-to-GDP ratio of any government in Australia's history. That is what the Labor Party promised the Australian people. They had a 45 per cent emissions target, which they couldn't understand, which they didn't explain to the Australian people and which they refused to cost at the last election. We know that the Labor Party have a hereditary addiction, passed down from chairman Swan to the member for Rankin, to tax and spend. We know that the Labor Party promised surpluses but never delivered them. We know on this side of the House that we stand for more jobs, for lower taxes and for paying back Labor's debt.</span>

Of course, the National Relay Service is a very important communication service for Australians who are deaf, hearing impaired or have a speech impediment. We have committed to spend $22 million a year to deliver the National Relay Service, so that people who have a hearing impairment, or speech difficulties, are able to use the telephone system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is very important that we are getting good value for money for taxpayers, and that's why we've recently gone through a competitive procurement process under which the incumbent, ACE, Australian Communication Exchange, had the opportunity to bid to retain the contract. And in the result they did not retain the contract. The contract has been awarded to a new company, Concentrix, who will continue the National Relay Service commencing from 1 February 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It follows a competitive selection process which is designed to get the best possible outcome for Australians who need to use the National Relay Service. Indeed, the Concentrix service will offer new options which are not available under the current arrangements, including, for example, the ability to receive texts over iPads, tablets and smartphones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it very clear: the Morrison government is technology agnostic about the services provided through the National Relay Service. At the moment, the position is that the owner of the existing proprietary CapTel system has cited an exclusive agreement and has declined to provide it. Should they be interested in providing it, to maintain it for existing recipients of the CapTel service, of course we'd be very happy to speak to them about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do want to make it absolutely clear that there is no threat to the National Relay Service. The National Relay Service will be maintained. There will continue to be the provision of technology. Indeed, there will be new technology options under which people who are hearing impaired, or who are speech impaired, can view text so that what is spoken by the person on the other end of the phone is converted into text, which they will be able to view. The National Relay Service is very important and the National Relay Service is continuing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, when the Labor Party was in government they spent billions of dollars on failed border policies, they put money into pink batts and they wasted billions and billions of dollars. This meant that they had to cut $128 million from the AFP, $30 million and 88 staff from the ACC, $27 million and 56 staff from AUSTRAC, and $735 million and 700 staff from Customs resulting in a 25 per cent reduction in sea cargo screening and a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo screening. That's the approach that Labor always brings to the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast to that approach is what this government has done since we've been in government since 2013. We've been able to restore integrity to the budget. We're returning to surplus. We are putting additional money into the Home Affairs portfolio, and it's important to do so because we face threats in an unprecedented way. This year, we'll put $6.4 billion into the Home Affairs portfolio so that we can keep our borders secure. We know that there are 70 million people in the world at the moment who are seeking asylum. We know that that includes three million people in the Indo-Pacific region alone. So thoughts that we can soften our borders are completely ridiculous and fraught, but it's the policy of the Labor Party. We've been able to invest money into that space. We have been able to deal with protections at our borders because we don't just worry about drugs coming across our borders; we are worried about gun parts and other illicit substances that end up destroying lives and families in our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIO is dealing with an unprecedented threat when it comes to foreign interference. We've got firms that are being targeted for their intellectual property. Solicitors doing work for companies who are seeking contracts overseas are having their systems attacked. As we know, the AFP and ASIO are dealing with the very real threat of terrorism, like any other Western democracy. Through their work we've been able to disrupt 16 attempted terrorist attacks in our country. And it doesn't stop there. The Home Affairs portfolio also has responsibility for cybersecurity. We want to make sure that families, and in particular kids, are safe online. You can only do that if the budget is back in black and you can afford to invest with certainty in these areas.</span>

I would like to acknowledge her strong commitment to the South Australian defence industry. The Morrison government's strong budget is delivering more jobs and opportunities for small business in the defence industry and also for bolstering our defence capability. I'm extremely proud to have led a record delegation of Australian businesses at the Defence and Security Equipment International trade show in London last week. Australia had 61 exhibitors there last week as part of Team Defence Australia, showing off their expertise in one of the biggest defence-exports events on the world calendar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For us, this event is all about backing Aussie businesses, especially small and emerging businesses, to generate new export opportunities, creating more investment and securing jobs at home and abroad. That's what you get when you have a strong budget. That's how you can support your small businesses. Team Defence Australia did us proud. I want to put on record my thanks for the way that they magnificently showcased Australian businesses on the world stage. They showed that Australian innovation is right up there with the world's best, and can I tell you that the whole world was watching very closely the Australian delegation in London. Members of the House may have also seen a report on the television program <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Night</span> that showed examples of Aussie ingenuity from companies such as DefendTex, which is based in Melbourne. DefendTex was one of the 13 companies that I announced were receiving support from the Morrison government to help them grow under our defence export grants process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another exhibitor was Craig International Ballistics, from the electorate of Fadden, on the Gold Coast. This company also received funding to help it to become export ready. When I was there I also announced Defence Innovation Hub funding for ECLIPS, which is based here in Canberra. I was there for the signing of a $15 million defence industry deal between German giant Rheinmetall and Sydney defence business Thomas Global, which will create up to 20 new jobs in Western Sydney. The funding support and the signing of that deal highlight my priority for the Defence Industry portfolio. This is all about helping small businesses to be a key part of the Morrison government's $200 billion investment in defence capability. The London trade show demonstrated that Australian defence companies are on the world's radar. All of this is possible because our government is delivering strong and stable government. The Morrison government is backing small businesses and is on the side of Aussie workers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:33</span>):  One of the biggest challenges facing this country and its budget into the future is funding the provision of in-home aged-care services. In recent budgets we have increased the number of places by over 20,000. I will ask the health minister to add further to this answer. The reason that more Australians are choosing to receive that care at home is because they want the choice to do that. This is an important choice: to be able to stay at home and receive the care that they want, among their loved ones, and be able to spend birthdays and family gatherings together at their home. That is why our top priority when it comes to aged care is increasing the number of in-home aged-care places, which we are doing. The only way you can do that is by ensuring you maintain a strong budget. That's what you must do, and that's what our government is doing. When you can manage money, you can look in the eye the people who are looking for those in-home aged-care places and tell them that the number of in-home aged-care places is increasing, as it is under this government, and you can promise to deliver on that because you know how to manage money. I'll ask the Minister for Health to add to the answer.</span>

I can confirm that the latest figures available only today are an advance on what I provided in the consideration-in-detail stage last week. Last week I informed the House that we had increased from 60,000 home care packages when we came to government to a projected 124,000 for the last financial year. In fact, the figures available just today are 125,000, or an increase of over 25,000 places and 25 per cent in one year. That is potentially one of the largest increases in home care places in terms of both raw numbers and percentages in Australian history. In addition to that I can say that we are now projected to increase to 157,000 places by 2022-23. So that is a 161 per cent increase in home care places on our watch, in our time.</span>

On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I welcome St Joseph's from Penshurst in my electorate, who are here today. I say a big hello to them. I'll give you a sense. They travelled 11 hours by bus to get to Parliament House yesterday. They have had a full day here as part of the PACER program. It's a wonderful program. I know that it has enjoyed cooperation from both sides of the House. It's wonderful to see St Joseph's here today with us.</span>

It was $18.7 billion last year, it is $19.9 billion this year, and will be $21.4 billion next year and $22.9 billion the year after. Spending is growing fastest for state schoolsâaround 6.4 per cent per student each year from 2019 to 2023, compared to per student growth of 4.9 per cent for the non-government sector. But it's not just money that we on this side of the House are about. We also want to make sure that that money is well spent and that it leads to better results and better outcomes.

I refer the member to the previous answer from both myself and the Minister for Health, and I state again that increasing the number of in-home aged-care places is one of the biggest priorities of my government. We will continue to make gains in this area. I look forward to the future statements of the government to build on those statements that we've already made, which have increased the number of places, particularly for those on level 4 packages. The reason you can do that is because you manage a strong budget and you can keep adding places. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do pick up the point the Minister for Health makes: at the last election, despite $387 billion of higher taxes, Labor could not find $1 extra to create one extra in-home aged-care placeâ$387 billion of higher taxes, and even then they couldn't fund these essential services. Yet, on our side of the House, we have been increasing those places for in-home aged care by getting the budget in order, by ensuring that we control what we spend so we can spend it on the priorities. One of my government's big priorities is to ensure that we deliver even more in-home aged-care places to deal with this issue. If the health minister would like to add something, he should feel free to do so.</span>

I'm also delighted to inform the House that, in fact, there has been a seven per cent reduction in the waiting list in the last three months alone. That follows a 25 per cent increase in home care places over the course of the last year. Those two things are directly relatedâan increase in home care places, because the budget can afford it, and a decrease of seven per cent in waiting times and the waiting list, which we are informing the House of just today.</span>

She has been a medical researcher and a paediatrician at national level. There are many people on both sides who come with great medical careers, but hers is one of the finest. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things she has reminded me of recently is that, as a paediatrician, she knew in 2011 many patients and parents who were unable to receive the medicine Symbicort despite the fact that it had been approved by the PBAC and a pricing agreement had been reached with the government. The reason this medicine for severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was not available was that the then government ran out of money and refused to list it on the PBS. As a consequence, her patientsâreal patients with whom she, as a paediatrician, had to deal on a frequent basisâwere unable to access that medicine. Fortunately, this latest round includes a new medicine for COPD, which is being listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also includes other very important medicines such as Buvidal. Buvidal is a medicine which is being made available to help people who have opioid addiction get themselves off that opioid addiction. It's a substitute and it's a pathway for people to reduce, eliminate and ultimately overcome opioid addiction. It has potential impacts for 110,000 Australians who face this catastrophic condition, and we will be making it available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for free, which is something we do because this will ultimately save lives and protect lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we are making a medicine available for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, in particular for patients who have Philadelphia chromosome-positive indications. This medicine, Sprycel, would otherwise cost over $50,000. I had the pleasure and the privilege of meeting Michael Clout. In 2011 Michael was given only a brief period to live. He was able to access Sprycel through clinical trials and subsequently through compassionate access. This medicine, which he said he would never have been able to afford on his own, has now been made available to all other patients in Australia with this particular variation of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It's now on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It's available to patients. It's about saving lives and protecting lives, which is ultimately what you can only do when you have a budget and the capacity to pay for it.</span>

The great thing about a strong economy and the dividends from it is that you're able to deliver services that matter to Australians. The NDIS is a great national endeavour. The Morrison government is backing in those with disability and their family and carers, and we are absolutely and utterly committed to delivering the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government the NDIS will always be fully funded. We will always have the money available and we'll always support those with disability. It's important to note that this is a world-first once-in-a-generation reform. Frankly it's the biggest since Medicare, and it will support up to 500,000 Australians within the next five years. It's something that we, as a parliament, should embrace as a truly bipartisan initiative for the benefit of all Australians. There are right now 300,000 Australians enjoying the benefits of the NDIS andâsomething we should celebrateâthere are 100,000 Australians receiving a service for the very first time. Member for Berowra, that includes 554 of your constituents, who are receiving a service for the first time in their life. That is something this parliament, together, should celebrate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding for the NDIS, like any demand driven program, is revised at every budget update to reflect the latest estimates. Building a strong budget is key, because that enables us to make the critical investments we need to make. Earlier this year we announced significant pricing increases. From 1 July this year an additional $1.6 billion is being provided into the market for 2019-20 to encourage sustainability and innovative services to assist not just the participants in the member for Berowra's seat but participants in everyone's seat across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next three years we'll invest $398 million into information linkages and capacity-building programs. At the very last meeting of all ministers across the country we agreed to put in $90 million, to deal with and solve some of the interfaces at a health level, and in a few weeks time we'll gather the DRC ministers again to tackle justice and mental health issues. Delivering this groundbreaking reform to improve outcomes for Australians with significant and permanent disability is an absolute and utter priority for the Morrison government, and I know it's a real priority for the parliament.</span>

The royal commission into aged care has heard that, in the weeks before Earle Haven suddenly closed, the government knew that 50 per cent of residents were regularly physically restrained and 71 per cent were chemically restrained. Does he agree with the commission that this knowledge should have raised alarm bells and that there should have been a clinical team down there the next day? Does he agree this was a profound failure of the government's regulatory system?</span>

When I initiated the royal commission into aged care I did so because I wanted to knowâand I want to ensureâthat all Australians had the light shone on our aged-care system and wanted to identify whatever failings were there and whatever horror stories were there. I told Australians, at the time, that they needed to be prepared for some very difficult information to come back from that aged-care royal commission. What I propose to do is to let the royal commission do its jobâto compile its evidence; to prepare its recommendations. There will be an interim report, which will be handed down shortly, and we'll deal with any response that is required at that time. Then we will deal with the recommendations that come from any ultimate report.</span>

I am simply saying that the aged-care royal commission, when I announced itâand I commend the former opposition leader, the member for Maribyrnong, who gave bipartisan support to this aged-care royal commission, which was the right thing to do. We will apply ourselves to listening carefully to the outcomes of this aged-care royal commission, and then we will attend to the issues that are raised in it. But you will only be able to do that when you can do it from a position of budget strength.</span>

If I weren't prepared to hear these stories, I would have never called the royal commission that ensured that these measures and these instances could be brought to light. So I am prepared for this aged-care royal commission, that I initiated, to be able to look into these matters and report to the government so the government can take the action, as we should and as we will.</span>

That can only happen thanks to the stability and certainty of the strong budget that the Morrison government has delivered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over five million people depend on social services for their primary source of incomeâsome 2Â½ million people on the age pension, and people also on Newstart, the disability support pension and many other working-age income support benefits. There are also many others who depend, in part, on benefits delivered through the social services system, such as the family tax benefit. Indeed, social security and welfare, this year, will comprise some $180 billion of expenditureâmore than a third of the entire Commonwealth budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can deliver this support because we have a strong budget. Every dollar that is paid to somebody under the social services and welfare budget is a dollar that has to be collected from another Australian in tax, so it's very important that our commitments are sustainable. Our promise to the Australian people is that if you meet the eligibility conditions then you're able to receive a payment. But if the social services and welfare system is not sustainable then you potentially have a problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous government, social security and welfare expenditure was growing at roughly twice the rate of tax revenue. That is not a sustainable position. Under this government, we've got that under control. The rate of growth of tax revenue now exceeds the rate of growth of welfare expenditure, and that means if, as an Australian, you are entitled to receive a benefit then you can be confident that, when you turn up to claim the benefit to which you are entitled, the government will be able to pay it. It's a very important proposition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made it our priority to get people off welfare and into the workforce. Some 1.4 million jobs have been created since we came to government. There are 230,000 fewer people of working age on welfare, as at June 2018, compared to four years earlier. In fact the level of the working-age population on welfare, at 14.3 per cent, is at its lowest level in 30 years. We are making sure that welfare is available for those who need it and we are helping those who are not in work to return to the workforce. And it all depends on having a strong budget, which gives stability and certainty, underpinning our social services system.</span>

As the Prime Minister indicated, he called the commission knowing that there would be stories that would shock Australians. I will give the context. The commission followed the Oakden tragedyâthe crisis at a South Australian state-run facilityâwhich led to some of the most shocking scenes in aged care and, indeed, institutional care in postwar Australian history. That was why the Prime Minister called it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the commission itselfâand we urge the commission to continue its work and to go fearlessly on with its work; and I have to say that the commission has done that so farâas the Prime Minister said at the time, we will continue to get on with the job of regulating and safeguarding Australians whilst the commission carries out its work. That was why we appointed the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner. Janet Anderson is doing that role, and has been conducting inspections around the country. At the same time as the royal commission has been going on, she and her team have been conducting inspections and, where breaches have been found, calling out and highlighting any inadequacies. We did this for the very reason that we believe that every Australian in aged care deserves to be protected, deserves to be supported, and deserves to have their safety guarded each and every day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, in relation to Earle Haven, the minister for aged care, Senator Colbeck, appointed Kate Carnell to conduct an inquiry. The Carnell inquiry is going on as we speak. I would also note that one of the proprietors, Mr Miller, failed to appear before an inquiry. I would urge Mr Miller to appear before all inquiries as soon as he is fit to do so. I have to say that there can be no excuse for any of the proprietors not to appear before the relevant inquiries, whether by the Queensland state parliament, the royal commission or the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, my message to Mr Miller is: appear before the inquiry, fulfil your duty, explain your failures, apologise for your failures, and stand up and be counted for the failures on your watch in your time. That's why we've appointed Kate Carnell, that's why we've appointed Janet Anderson and that's why we've appointed a royal commission to do what no previous government has ever done before.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In anticipation of this, I've got the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice </span>open at pages 502 and 503, and I'd ask people who are confused about this matter to familiarise themselves with it. It makes it very clear, with respect to independent questions, that the practice has been that they're asked in proportion to their numbers. That's certainly happening already, with that earlier question. Then, if one side doesn't jump, my responsibility is to allocate the call to the person I think jumped first. In this case it was the Leader of the Opposition. If it had not been, I'm making very clear, I would have called the Leader of the Opposition anyway, because page 502 of <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice </span>makes clear that preference is given on the government side to the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister and on the opposition side to the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. So, that's the practice that's there. I don't propose to deviate from it. The allocation of the call is something I do. It's not a ruling but the way, and that's also very clear.</span>

Does the Prime Minister accept that a combination of deep cuts and the government's deregulation obsession have left older Australians who are in care vulnerable to abuse and to neglect? Why is the Prime Minister denying basic facts, failing to be up-front and failing to take responsibility in the seventh year, in the third term, of this government, even for the most vulnerable Australians?</span>

Interest rates are down from 3.5 to almost zero, yet there's negligible movement in the macro statistics so beloved by government and public officials. In reality land, except for the suits, isn't most of Australia on struggle street? Treasurer, isn't this the historic moment for fiscal actionânot to assess, not to process, not to accept the stagnation imposed by Queensland's worst ever leaders? Surely petrol security screams Hells Gateâseven per cent of Australia's fuel: ethanol, clean and foreverâCopperString and Galilee rail explode employment and prosperity. Treasurer, will you get the shovel and join our chain gang? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I say to the member for Kennedy: unlike those opposite, we will not say one thing to the baristas of Batman and another to the miners of Mackay. We will speak up for those people who work in the resources sector, acknowledging that their jobs are important and that their contribution to the Australian economy is important, too.</span>

This morning I had the honour to visit Stanthorpe, in my own electorate, to see a community that has galvanised and put its arms around those that have lost. I have been able to partner with the Queensland government in increasing our category B payments for freight relief, and also concessional loans for repairs and construction, and also further freight. This builds on what we have already announced in partnership with the state government in terms of income: $900 per family, instantly, as soon as these fires took place. The Queensland government and the federal government worked hand in hand. We made sure the people who were impacted were not out of pocket. We also have grants available for household goods and for the rebuilding of their properties. We stand ready, with the Queensland government, when they make further applications for assistance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was sobering this morning when I met with Assistant Commissioner Megan Stiffler, who ran operations, was the stark reminder of her assessment on the night the fires started. They made an assessment that there would be fatalities. The catastrophic nature of the fire that took place around Stanthorpe and Applethorpe meant that there was very little they thought they could doâthat there would be fatalities. Proudly, because of the meticulous planning those men and womenâboth professional and volunteersâhad put in place, not one life has been lost. Homes have been lost. I met Mr and Mrs Bourzali today. The day that they lost their house marked 50 years since they emigrated from France to Australia. Despite the pain and anguish that they and their family felt, all they were concerned about, all that they were proud about, was that they had a small-town community that put their arms around them. They had fire men and women stand there with them, trying to protect their homes and propertiesâfiremen like Pedro, who is the captain of the Rural Fire Service at Stanthorpe. He's just a knockabout bloke. He, along with his battalion, worked for over 24 hours trying to save their community. They're ordinary Australians doing extraordinary things. We should be proud of the fact that, in these darkest days, average Australians become great Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Not even the snow outside parliament today was as white as the empty pages of this Prime Minister's agendaâa government without a sense of purpose, a government without an agenda, a government without a plan and, most importantly, a government without a plan for the economy. But we've also seen today a government without a plan when it comes to important social policy, particularly when it comes to looking after senior Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is the seven times that this Prime Minister has voted to raise the pension age to 70 or whether it is the breaching of that famous promiseâby the first in the troika of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, prior to 2013âthat there'd be no cuts to pensions, what we've seen is that in each and every single budget they have come after pensioners. One of the reasons why we raise it again today is the number of pieces of legislation in which there are cuts before the parliament right now. They follow the 2014 budget cut of a billion dollars from pensioner concessions and follow on from 2015 when the deal with the Greens cut the pension of 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year. They follow the 2016 budget when the government tried to cut the pension of around 190,000 pensioners, in a similar way to the legislation that's in parliament today, and follow the attempted scrapping of the energy supplement for 1.5 million age pensioners. We saw it today from the Prime Minister when he described pensioners as welfare recipients. It said it all about the attitude about pensioners who have worked hard and paid taxes in this country their whole life and ask for dignity in their older years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also seeing it played out with the shocking evidence before the aged-care royal commission, a royal commission that this Prime Minister has the hide to say he initiated. The member for Maribyrnong went to an election campaigning for the aged-care royal commission and asked, time after time, for it to happen. What we had, in order to avoid a vote when they lost the numbers on that in this parliament, was the longest question time in history since Federationâremember thatâjust to avoid a vote in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, no wonder they were trying to avoid it, because this is the same Prime Minister who cut the aged-care budget by $1.2 billion when he was Treasurer, in the 2016-17 budget. When we asked today about the 16,000 Australians who have died while waiting for their approved aged-care package, what did he do? He had nothing to say about them. He didn't express any sympathy for them, their families or their communities; he just dismissed it with more politicking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before the royal commission began to hear the testimonies of the sector, we were rocked by the reports on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span>âpeople coming forward with the problems that were there in the system. We saw stories of degradation, suffering, abuse, neglect and systemic failure on this government's watch. We're a wealthy nation. We're compassionate. We're fair. How can we allow Margot, 99 years of age, blind and struggling to walk, to still be stuck on a waiting list to access adequate home care? How can we allow cases like that of Nancy Santoro, who, in the months before she died, was found with maggots infecting her untreated wounds? The father of Sarah Holland-Batt was left for days with unchanged incontinence pads. Then there was John Callaghan, who was already struggling with cancer but was found with maggots in his ear. Lisa Corcoran is just 43, one of the many younger Australians in a nursing home; she has been there since an accident when she was 37. A nursing home designed for the elderly is no place for a young person. Marooned away from her generation, Lisa has battled loneliness, and she's had to fight for the basic right to be showered more than once a week. That's all she's asking for: a bit of dignity. Then there's the 85-year-old artist, landscape architect and adoring grandfather who was left in his Alzheimer's-stricken state in an understaffed nursing home, suffering bone fractures and left to lie unattended in his own faeces. There's the man who died after no-one checked on him during a gastro outbreak. There are the residents of Earle Havenâas we raised today in the parliament before being dismissed by the governmentâwho were left abandoned and left to be rescued by the Queensland Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can we allow this to be the pay-off for a long life? Our elderly have seen so much. They've experienced the world as it's gone through some of the fastest yet most profound changes. Throughout their long lives, they have worked hard for this country. They've given so much to their families and their communities. They've paid tax, they've volunteered, they've raised children, they've farmed, they've run businesses and they've helped their neighbours. They've made sacrifices. They've fought in wars. They've battled fires. They've taught classes and they've played music. They have handed out more than they needed to in the church tray. They've helped friends and strangers. They've shown love and they've inspired it in others. They've contributed throughout their lives, and this abysmal litany of failure and neglect cannot be their reward. They cannot be sidelined because society has decided they no longer serve a purpose. They cannot be abandoned. Human dignity should not be too much for them to hope for. That's why a focus on senior Australians will be a focus of the Labor Party that I lead, because we need to treat these people with dignity. We're a wealthy country, and we can do so much better than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have more than 360,000 people who work in the aged-care sector. They are dedicated. So many of them are unsung heroes, and we rely upon them more than we allow ourselves to say. We're so grateful to the many who've shown great courage in coming forward to blow the whistle and make sure we all know what's going on. But there are too few aged-care workers, and they're paid too little. They've begged the government to do something. There are 129,000 older Australians waiting for aged care at home, with the waiting time for the highest level of care having doubledânot reduced but doubledâto two years. These people are our mothers and our fathers. For some, they are sisters and brothers. For some, they are people who've lived in our neighbourhood. But they are all Australians who deserve dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And for all of us, it's our future, too. We need to have a system that, as our nation ages, recognises that we need to put more resources in and plan more adequately. Quite frankly, the farcical situation whereby this government uses raw numbers to pretend that cuts aren't there, when there's an increasing ageing of the population, is, quite frankly, an insult to our intelligence in this parliament. But it's more than that: it's an insult to all Australians out there. Quite frankly, time's arrow flies in one direction, and it's taking us all along with it. The simple, unavoidable demographic truth is that the number of us who will require careâwhether at home or in facilitiesâis growing. There's a wave coming, and we're not ready for it. There are few things more urgent than the need for this government to shake off its complacency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will receive an interim report from the royal commission at the end of October. Action must be taken then. There's a need for a government response then. Today they went through all the reports they've had. It's no good having reports if you don't act on them. There's an interim report on the royal commission, and we will hold the government to account, because action must be taken, and time is simply not on our side. We cannot wait any longer. None of us can.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I have to say that when I first heard the topic for today's matter of public importanceârepresentative governmentâI really thought that the opposition was having us on. I really thought it was a try-on. After all, it was this opposition that sought to divide Australians, in a way that this country hasn't seen for decades, at the last federal election. They engaged in the politics of class warfare, they sought to turn Australians against each other and they targeted sections of our community for special treatment, for special discrimination. I speak of course, first and foremost, of Australia's retirees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition wasn't representing those 900,000 Australians when they wanted to snatch away their tax rebatesâordinary Australians, hardworking Australians, whom they sold down the river. I remember speaking to one gentleman who approached me at a polling booth in Bathurst. He said that he was a factory worker. He said that he worked two shifts, one in the day and one in the night, so that he could save for his retirement. He said to me that, while everyone else was sleeping, Member for Petrie, he was up working, and he was able to invest and save for his retirement. And all that stood to be snatched away from him by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, they weren't representing Australia's retirees. They weren't representing those hardworking men and womenâwho aren't wealthy people; these are people you see at your local Men's Shed or Lions Club. They weren't representing the coal workers or the power workers when they said that they were going to take their jobs and put them into some Orwellian 'just transition authority' to deal with so-called pooled redundancies. From Lithgow to Mudgee to the Hunter Valley to Queensland, they have forsaken those miners and power workers. They sold them down the river. And they were rewarded for those efforts appropriately at the last election. I remember very clearly the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition celebrating what he said was the collapse in the global coal market, because prices had droppedâa terrible way to treat all those coalminers and power workers right around Australia. The opposition weren't representing their interests. They weren't representing the farmers when they opposed drought relief, when they said they weren't going to support the Future Drought Fund. They went to the election opposing drought reliefâa $3.9 billion commitment for the Future Drought Fund, rising to $5 billion, providing $100 million every year, and they went to the election threatening to dismantle it, just as they went to the election threatening to dismantle the Regional Investment Corporation. They weren't representing farmers stricken by drought, not at all. The Regional Investment Corporation, providing concessional loans to farmers to help them get through drought, to provide water infrastructure loansânot only did they oppose it, they threatened to dismantle it. The Regional Investment Corporation set up in my own seat, in the wonderful city of Orange, with 25 to 30 jobs, and they went to the election threatening to take it away. No wonder the member for Hunter earned the nickname, in my neck of the woods, of the 'shadow minister for recentralisation', because he wanted to snatch decentralised jobs out of the country and put them back in the city!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They weren't representing the farmers. They weren't representing those men and women of Australia who were grappling with high power bills and high power prices with their wacky emissions targets that were so out of step with the Australian community. They weren't representing farmers or everyday Australians when they played footsies with the animal activists. The member for Hunter said that our farmers should 'surf the waves of activism', giving a quiet nod to those activists who have been terrorising our farmers right around Australia, as if our farmers didn't have enough to worry about, dealing with this awful drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that those opposite have forsaken those they purported to representâthe people who go to work every day in high-vis; the workers; the miners; the battlers; the elderly and the retirees. They have forsaken all of those people they purported to represent. Why have they done it, Member for Petrie? To pander to those inner city voters they thought were their core constituency, those green elements in Glebe, Newtown and Annandale. And they abandoned the rest of Australia. They haven't united Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They divided this country at the last election in a way that we haven't seen for years. No wonder their primary vote shrank to the lowest point in 100 years. They paid a price for it. Their politics and policies of division, and of turning Australians against each other, were roundly and rightly rejected by Australians at the last federal election. So how dare they come into this place and lecture us about representing all Australians, when they basically went to the last election on a platform of division, of turning Australians against each otherâof class warfare. It was a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House are getting on with the job. I would like to talk today about the Australian government's wonderful infrastructure program, which we have working for Australia. We've got a $100 billion infrastructure pipeline, and we are committed to getting key projects going right around Australia. They are long-term infrastructure plans, including, for exampleâ</span>

                  </a>  They don't like it, Deputy Speaker. They can't handle the truth. Roads of Strategic Importance: $4.5 billion in upgrades on key freight roads across regional Australia to improve the efficiency of freight transport. It includes wonderful projects like the Coffs Harbour bypass, $971 million and 1,800 jobs created, and Dixons Long Point, in my own electorate. I've spoken about that project many times. It is connecting the regions, and the great regions of Mudgee and Orange, making it easier to travel between the regions, connecting them for health, business and tourism and connecting them from the Hunter all the way down to Canberra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $4 billion Urban Congestion Fund is targeting pinch points, traffic safety and network efficiency for commuter and freight movement in urban areas. There's blackspot funding: $1 billion from 2013-14 to 2022-23, and $110 million annually from 2023-24 until 2029-30. It's making a real difference to the lives of people, particularly those in country communities, as is the Roads to Recovery Program. This is a $500 million per annum program, from 2013-14 to 2022-23, funding $5.6 billion of vital local road infrastructure, helping our local councils build those roads that they otherwise wouldn't be able to undertake and keep projects moving. Then there is the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, with $508 million from 2013-14 to 2022-23, with ongoing funding of $65 million each year from 2023-24 to 2029-30.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at the Bridges Renewal Program. We've had many bridges in country Australia repaired, making it easier for farmers to get their produce and freight to markets, building the future of Australia. It has been one of the truly popular programs amongst councils in particular, because otherwise they would not be able to get these bridges upgraded. Many of them are timber bridges that are over 100 years old. Some were originally built in the days of the gold rush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Australia Beef Roads Program has $100 million from 2017-18 to 2020-21 for targeted upgrades to key roads necessary for transporting cattle. For roads, we've got $23 billion in budget commitments including an additional $1 billion for the Princes Highway and an additional $2.2 billion for the Local and State Government Road Safety Package.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's pretty clear that the quiet Australians really did speak. They rejected the politics of division. They rejected the politics of class warfare. What they did do is vote for a government that's getting things done. Nowhere is this seen more than in the field of infrastructure. There is a lot of chirp from the other sideânot a lot of action, just a lot of division.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  I have to say that that was one of the worst defences I've ever seen in an MPI. After six years, all he could talk about was a pipeline of infrastructure that may or may not happen in years to come. You're not talking about your record, because your record includes a cut in every budget of pensioners' take-home pay. That's what you're doing. In every budget you are trying to cut money from pensioners. Today the Prime Minister referred to pensioners as welfare recipients. That's what we heard in question time today. We also heard in question time today that, after six years, four ministers and billions of dollars cut out of the aged-care system, he will not take responsibility for where we are with aged care today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday was the first anniversary of the royal commission being called. Yes, we did welcome it, because this government had done nothing for years and had ripped money out. We did welcome it. The Prime Minister is the architect of $2 billion in cuts to the aged-care system. It has been absolutely cut. Some 129,000 older Australians are sitting on the waiting list for home care. The wait times have doubled for home care. The list has gone from 88,000 to 129,000. The average wait time for people to get a care package in their home has doubled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A week doesn't go by without another disturbing report from the royal commission about either home care or residential care. We are deeply concerned about the accreditation and regulation failures under this government. Even Earle Haven happened under your new regulations with you in charge. You need to accept responsibility for what is happening in the aged-care system today. It is not acceptable to have the Prime Minister come in here and pretend that he has had nothing to do with this, when he was the architect of those cuts. It's not okay. None of this had to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has dozens of reports sitting on its desk on how to fix thisâdozens of them. We can talk about them. There is the Law Reform Commission report on elder abuse. It made 43 recommendations. How many of them have been fully implemented? The majority of them still have not been. Let's look at the Tune legislated review report. For two years that has been on the government's desk. There were over 30 recommendations. How many of them have been fully implemented? Not even half. Next month the Carnell-Paterson review will have been sitting on the government's desk for two years. What have they done with that? There were 10 recommendations. How many of them have been fully implemented? Twoâtwo out of 10âafter what happened at Oakden, which is one of the reasons the royal commission was called.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health today say, 'We'll get Kate Carnell to do a report into what happened at Earle Haven.' She already did a review of Oakden, and yet you still haven't implemented those recommendations. How long is the report on Earle Haven going to take you to implement?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the Prime Minister admit today that he's not going to do anything until the royal commission gives its final report in November 2020. Older Australians who are sitting in the aged-care system today waiting for a home care package or suffering neglect in the aged-care residential system cannot wait two more years for the government to do something. It has taken them two years to not act on their existing reports; how long will it take to fully implement any recommendations of the royal commission? We will still be here in 10 years time with a government not doing anything. Hopefully, we will have won an election by then, because we will do something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side can never be trusted when it comes to aged care. We had bipartisan support for some serious reforms with Living Longer Living Better in 2013, and what have we seen from this government? Even though we extended an offer to deal with the seriousness of this and offered bipartisanship in trying to deal with the issues, what have we got in return? We've got obfuscation and a lack of responsibility. This is a government in its third term after six years. You still don't have a plan to fix it. How does the home care package waitlist go from 88,000 to 129,000 and you not have a plan to fix it? The Prime Minister said, 'We might do something else.' It's not okay for you to say to people in their 90s sitting at home waiting for home care, 'We will get a report in 2020 and then we might fully implement something in a couple of years to come.' It's not okay. It's not good enough. Older Australians, their families and their loved ones cannot afford to wait for this government to work out that it was re-elected, that it has to fix these things and that it needs to implement all of the reports sitting on its desk.</span>

It doesn't matter whether they are rich, poor, unemployed, doing wellâwhatever their circumstances areâit is important to help them. That's why our government has a plan around agriculture, health, mental healthâwhich the member for Reid will speak aboutâour Defence Force, security, the environment. There are so many things that we want to get done to help Australians, and that's what we're here to do: help Australians. We want to ensure everyone gets to be their best and that everyone gets ahead. We want to ensure that people have dignity and security of work so people can 'tread their own path', as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Barefoot Investor</span> would say, not rely on government handouts.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance today and to follow the Leader of the Opposition and our shadow minister on this topic. The government is failing to represent the interests of all Australians, in particular some of our most vulnerable Australiansâthat is, our older Australians. Our parents, our grandparents, our great aunts and our unclesâthe elders of our communitiesâhave spent their lives working and caring for us. These are the people whom I thought were some of the Prime Minister's 'quiet Australians'. But maybe they are too quiet, because all they're getting from this government now is unfunded empathy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the announcement of a royal commission into aged care, and it has proven that there is not one part of Australia's aged-care system that isn't affected by crisis. As a nurse, I thought I might offer some advice to the government on how they could start to fix aged care right now and give our elderly Australians the dignity they deserve. I have three points: (1) workforce; (2) funding that is fit for purpose; and (3) the need for accountability and transparency in the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workforce is one of the most crucial parts to fixing our broken aged-care system. Despite putting money into a 'workforce strategy', how does the government know that the money's actually being spent on the workforceâon nurses, on carers, on people with the skills that are needed to care for demented patients? We've heard time and time again that staff want more time to care. It has emerged as a key issue of the royal commission. It is something which the wonderful aged-care unionsâthe United Workers Union, the ANMF and the HACSUâhave been raising for years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Staffing numbers, skill mix, staff training, qualifications and experience are key concerns which, if absent, negatively impact on the ability of staff to provide safe quality care. The impetus to get this right is enormous. In order to meet ever-increasing demand for aged-care services and support the workforce will need to more than triple by 2050. By 2050 we will need to have more than one million Australians working in aged care. This represents a workforce growth rate of about two per cent annually in order to meet future demand at a time when the overall employment-to-population ratio will be declining. We have got to have a quality workforce which sees aged-care workers getting the respect and dignity they deserve. Aged care is not babysitting. It requires a skilled, well-taught, well-paid and respected workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the government must that ensure funding is adequate to meet the needs of our ageing population and is linked to care. That means proper residential care, better and more home-care packages and adequate funding for rural and residential aged-care facilities, who are struggling to stay afloat, struggling to cope with growing demand for complex-care patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the ABC reported that more than half of the nursing homes run by Australia's largest provider, Bupa, are failing basic standards of care, and 30 per cent are putting the health and safety of the elderly who are under their care at risk. Now, I'm sorry, but how does a provider that receives nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer subsidies get away with this? The funding needs to be tied to care. It is a simple premise. If a for-profit provider is making millions of dollars out of publicly funded beds yet is not providing enough staff or delivering quality of care, and is risking the lives of those residents, that's got to be addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the government must drive greater accountability for the delivery and use of aged-care funding by providers. Publishing staff numbers, for example, is a simple reform that could drive better care, as is allowing scrutiny of taxpayers' funds and opening the books to regulators. It's not something new. With the superannuation industry, for example, APRA enforces superannuation funds to open their books and get scrutiny. We could do the same in aged care. For those who do provide better care and for those who have nothing to worry about, this would not be worrying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to stand here and tell you that the solution is simple. It isn't. The solution requires thought and genuine reform that overhauls the sector and ensures the respect, the safety and the dignity of all elderly people who are in care. The government is failing older Australians when they need us most. Worse, the government have no plans and no ideas on how they're going to fix the system or how they're going to ensure that aged-care residents get the nursing and care they deserve. Waiting for the royal commission to report in 2020 is not an option.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr MARTIN:</span>
                  </a>  There are four pillars to this plan, guaranteeing access to essential health services and medications through the Medicare Benefits Scheme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We've listed 2,100 new medicines on the PBS since 2013. The second pillar is supporting health infrastructure, including both public and private hospitals, as well as improving the private health insurance system. The third is prioritising preventive health and, in particular, mental healthâan initiative that I'm particularly passionate about as a psychologist. Finally, the fourth pillar: through the Medical Research Future Fund, we are investing in world-leading research in medical treatments and technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My maiden speech focused on the importance of prioritising the mental health of Australians and the need to take a proactive role in measures to lower the suicide rate in Australia. As a psychologist and a researcher I have been there firsthand, and I know how important it is to invest in mental health for the wellbeing of our country. Almost four million Australians suffer from some form of chronic or episodic mental illness each year, and 50 per cent of us will face a mental health challenge across our life span. There are a number of ways that this government is investing in services to improve the mental health of Australians. The government is investing $275 million to support a number of national and local initiatives to strengthen community resources to address mental health issues. This includes $114.5 million for a trial of eight new walk-in adult mental health centresâequivalent to the youth program headspace, which is also expanding, with a $375 million investment, including $110 million going into early-psychosis youth services programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With over one million Australians suffering from eating disorders, $63 million will be spent to establish new residential eating disorders facilities across Australia. This supports the greater integration of existing treatment programs, including the MBS items for the treatment of eating disorders for individuals suffering in Australia. This will be rolled out in November this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mother and as a psychologist, I understand how important it is to support children in early childhood and also how important it is to support new parents at this stage of life. It is estimated that 100,000 people in Australia are affected by perinatal anxiety and depression each year. The Perinatal Mental Health and Wellbeing Program will improve the range of services available for new mums and dads facing mental illness. This reflects a $43.9 million investment, which will complement the work already being done in this space by the primary health networks nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An aspect of mental health I am particularly passionate about is fostering mentally healthy workplaces that allow Australians to maintain their mental wellbeing. Working with organisations such as the Business Council of Australia, the Black Dog Institute and Beyond Blue, our government is committed to ensuring that employers have the tools to promote good mental health for the 12.5 million working Australians. With the challenges facing our farmers and rural communities, we are also investing $5.5 million for communities in Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania affected by drought, fire and floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Suicide remains the leading cause of death among 15- to 44-year-olds in Australia, and every life lost is a national tragedy. The Prime Minister is leading the charge to ensure that our government is working towards a zero suicide goal. Under the guidance of the National Suicide Prevention Adviser to the Prime Minister, Christine Morgan, the Morrison government is investing $55 million in the National Suicide Prevention Trials and creating the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund. Evidence based policy informed by up-to-date research is the key to ensuring that we invest in effective programs to reduce our suicide rate in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to be part of a government which is prioritising the mental health of Australians and investing significantly in health more broadly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to speak today on this matter of public importance. Few things are more important in this country than looking after our older Australiansâpeople who have, for their entire life, contributed to the welfare of the nation. I will come to the aged-care issue and the government's treatment of pensioners, but I want to raise very briefly the issue of older Australians who are seeking to get back into the workforce. As we know, the Newstart rules are that you have to keep looking for work well into your 50s, and older Australians find it very difficult. They are facing age discrimination. I have two cases that my office is dealing with now. One case is of a 64-year-old man. His job used to be training delivery drivers for supermarkets. He was made redundant several years ago. He recently applied for a delivery driver job at another supermarket chain and, despite his years of experience, he did not get the job. He asked why and he was not given a reason. There are aspects to this that I'm seeking to find out, but what concerns me is that he seems to have been displaced by someone on a visaâand I think that certainly bears more investigation. We are talking about an older Australian who, on the face of it, seems to have been displaced by somebody on a visa when he is ready and willing to work. This was for a supermarket delivery job. We are not talking about a highly skilled job which a worker needs to come in from overseas in order to do. We are talking about somebody with the experience and the skills who has not been given that jobâand I really question why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another case I have is of a 55-year-old woman with years of aged-care experience. She was made redundant and went to a job provider. The job provider keeps putting her name forward for aged-care work, but she never hears anything back. There is an aged-care centre in her city which has put on several overseas workers in aged-care roles. She is an aged-care worker with years of experience and she's not getting the offers. Why not? Why are these people with this experience being held back? These are questions that need to be asked. As we know, there are far too many people on visas coming in and taking the jobs that can go to Australians with experience. We know that there is a place for people on visas with special skillsânobody doubts thatâbut it is absolutely disgraceful that experienced and skilled Australian workers, particularly older Australian workers who face all sorts of hurdles getting into the workforce, aren't being offered the jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We come to the aged-care system. It is absolutely broken. Yesterday was the anniversary of the calling of this royal commission. The lack of progress by the government since then, on any actionâand the Prime Minister's disgraceful words today, where he was essentially saying that he's going to wait another year before he takes any meaningful action on dealing with the crisis facing aged careâis just untenable. There is not one part of Australia's aged-care system that has not been impacted by the ongoing crisis. Not a day goes by without another disturbing account being told. Just this week we have had the disturbing revelations of what has been going on with Bupa, one of the main providers in this country, a for-profit provider, creaming off millions from the public purse to provide a service to older Australians, and failing to provide that service. It is absolutely disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally I took great pleasure inâI shouldn't say 'working'; that is overstating itâspending a day in the life of an aged-care worker. Some of us on this sideâI'm sure those on the other side have been invited to do the sameâspent a day in the life of an aged-care worker. We went to an aged-care service and we spent our day in the kitchen, on the floor, looking at the work that aged-care workers do. They work incredibly hard under very stressful conditions. I worked in a kitchen on that day.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Member for Maribyrnong; I appreciate that. The pace of work they do, from 6 am till well into the afternoon, is unrelenting. They have mere minutes to mop up and to roam through the rooms. They are on their feet. We are talking, again, usually of older women in these very physically demanding roles, with heavy trays of dishes to put into the big washers and dryers. It is very demanding, very fast-paced and unrelenting, and they are very short-staffed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance regarding the need to represent all Australians. The good news is that that is in fact happening already thanks to the great economic leadership in particular from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. It is by running a strong economy that we can afford to invest in the services that all Australians need. There is no doubt that our economy is facing some international headwinds that are outside of our control, but there are things that are within our control, and thank God that the Morrison government, re-elected on 18 May, is in charge of our economy now. You can imagine where we would be with $387 billion of new taxes being inflicted on our economy right now; we would be in recession. That's never good for vulnerable Australians or for any Australians. We are already undertaking the implementation of our agenda to grow the economy. We have already passed income tax cuts, because we on this side of the House know money that has been put back in the pockets of Australians is much better spent than money spent by governments. We trust Australians with their own money. We want to see them making their own decisions about how to invest their hard-earned funds in themselves and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also undertaking a massive infrastructure investment to help stimulate our economy, with $100 billion being spent. In South Australia we are getting our fair shareâin particular a very major project, the Main South Road upgrade, which has been invested in by all sides of politics at a state and federal level for some time now and which must be finished, and we are working with the state Marshall government to finish the North-South Corridor in Adelaide. In my own electorate of Sturt there are three projects, three very important intersections, as part of our plan to bust congestion and get people home quicker and safer: the Magill and Portrush Roads Intersection Upgrade, the Fullarton and Cross Roads Intersection Upgrade and the Glen Osmond and Fullarton Roads Intersection Upgrade. I'm very grateful for the decisions the government has made to invest in my electorate of Sturt to help the families of Sturt, Adelaide and South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also undertaking a massive commitment in defence acquisition in South Australia through the continuous naval shipbuilding program that this government has committed to. Under the previous Labor government, not a single capital vessel was committed to in their six years. Now, we have commitments for the first two offshore patrol vessels, to be built in Adelaide until there won't be room for them, because we will be commencing construction of the nine Type 26 frigates, as well as the 12 Attack class submarines. The submarine program is a $50 billion commitment and the frigate program is a $35 billion commitment. If you add that to the offshore patrol vessel component being done in Adelaide, it is a $90 billion commitment to naval shipbuilding, all based out of the Osborne Naval Shipyard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note the recent trade performance in this country, which I don't think has had the attention it deserves. The kind of data we are now seeing is truly phenomenal, thanks to our hard work with free-trade agreements. Just recently we announced another period of trade surplus: 'In the month of July, Australia posted another record level of exports both for goods, at $34.2 billion, and for services, at $8.4 billion.' So, Australia posted its second-highest trade surplus: $7.3 billion. Most importantly, we are seeing the fruits of our labours when it comes to the free-trade agreements that have been signed. Goods exports to China have increased by 27 per cent on the previous financial year. It is $133.8 billion. Exports to Japan are up 21 per cent, to $58.3 billion. Exports to Korea are up 21 per cent, to $24.9 billion. Exports to the ASEAN countries are up 25 per cent, to $40.7 billion. This is the dividend from the hard work that we have been doing when it comes to signing free trade agreements and growing the wealth of our nation. We are delivering. We have a plan for growth and prosperity for this country, versus Labor's plan, which would have driven us into recession.</span>

It is clear that this government do not represent the interests of all Australians, but they are good at some things. They are very, very good at cutting services to Australians. A zebra doesn't change its stripes. From the very moment these people have been in government, they have been looking for things to cut. So, I thought we'd go back on a bit of a journey through the cuts, the best cutsâ</span>

                  </a>  Thanks, member for Petrie, we'll put some positive spin on your cuts. Here we go. In 2014âthe budget where Joe Hockey and Senator Cormann, from other place, sat around and patted themselves on the back on a job well done, with cigars in handâthey had cut after cut for senior Australians. Let's go through a few of them. From 2017, asset and income test thresholds will be frozen. From 2017, the deeming thresholds for income tests will be reset. The qualifying age for the pension will be increased, as foreshadowed, to 70 by 2035âremember that one. The seniors supplement will be abolished by 1 July. The Seniors Health Card will be harder to qualify for. The Commonwealth will dramatically cut its support for various state and territory based seniors concessions. The dependent spouse tax offset, which was available for people with dependent spouses over 60, will be discontinued. The mature age worker tax offset will also be abolished. The government also abolished the pensioner education supplement. I note Deputy Speaker Kevin Andrews, the architect of many of these cuts, is in the chair. This is not to reflect on the chair, but they were policies of the former government. In 2015, the government did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension for thousands and thousands of Australians, and in 2016 there was a $1.2 billion cut by the then Treasurer. Of course, the then Treasurer is now the Prime Minister. And what does the Prime Minister do after the $1.2 billion cut? He doesn't return the funding; he calls a royal commission into aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the government that provide the care for our older Australians. The government, through their funding, provide the services to make sure staff are adequately resourced and that there are enough staff and that the staff have everything they need so that they're not overworked. I join the member for Lyons in recognising the outstanding work that our Australian aged-care workers do in really trying conditions. And what do the government do? They cut funding and they call a royal commission. I'm no prophet, but I can guarantee you that the royal commission will be looking at this and will be saying that the government need to return funding to the services that they cut. You can't cut your way to better services. So that was in 2016. Then what happened in 2018? Well, the coalition was considering a review of the Aged Care Funding Instrument to save between $3.3 billion and $5.4 billion over four years on top of the $2 billion shaved off in 2015 and 2016 when the Prime Minister was the Treasurer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single day they come into this place and they look for things to cut. They don't look for things to invest in. They look for things to cut. The latest thing they want to cut is Newstart. They want to look at ways to rip away the very, very basic support that people receive, to make it just a bit harder for people to get by. Instead of the punitive measures the government are bringing in, the government could simply take a big, deep breath and stop looking for things to cut. They could return funding to our aged-care services, they could lift the rate of Newstartâbecause it is overdue in this countryâand they could provide the support that Australians so desperately need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="74046" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOODENOUGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  The Morrison government certainly is representing the interests of all Australians by focusing on the lives and welfare of, and opportunities for, the people of Australia. We are getting on with the job and delivering what matters to everyday Australians by implementing plans to create up to 1Â¼ million new jobs over the next five years, by maintaining budget surpluses and paying down Labor's debt, by delivering tax relief for families and small businesses, by guaranteeing increased investment for schools, hospitals and roads, and by keeping Australians safe and our borders secure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is arguably the best country in the world in which to live, work and raise a family. As the Prime Minister is fond of saying: in Australia, if you have a go, you'll get a go. The government has legislated tax relief for 10 million working Australians, ensuring that they keep most of what they earn. By the time our tax plan is fully implemented over five years, 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay a top marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar. This rewards and encourages work. Tax relief means families can get ahead and more money flows through our economy. The government has also lowered taxes for 3.4 million small and medium businesses across the nation, which employ over seven million Australians. This will help create more jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a stronger economy, the Morrison government is delivering more funding for schools, with an extra $37 billion over a decade, which represents an average 62 per cent funding increase per student. In our hospitals the government's new five-year agreements will deliver an extra $31 billion to our health system. Since 2013, more than 2,100 new medicines worth over $10.6 billion have been subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These medications help people who are suffering from cancer, heart disease and other illnesses. The Morrison government has taken action to lower electricity and childcare costs. We're investing a record $100 billion in congestion-busting infrastructure ranging from major roads and rail projects to commuter car parks. These projects will create jobs and ensure families get home sooner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National coalition government is taking tough action against law-breaking unions, whose bullying and intimidation delay infrastructure and hurt small business and our economy. In rural and regional areas, the Morrison government is delivering practical help for drought-affected farmers. New legislation is also stopping activists from threatening farming families. In terms of protecting the environment, we're taking action to ensure we recycle plastic rather than shipping it overseas or dumping it. A stronger economy is the key to creating more and better-paying jobs. It is the key to keeping Australians safe and being able to pay for essential services. Australia's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 2.3 per centâstronger than the OECD average and all of the G7 economies except the United States. The coalition's 2013 election promise for one million new jobs to be created within five years was delivered ahead of schedule, with more than 1.3 million Australians in jobs since this government was elected. Nearly 60 per cent of these have been full-time jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is investing in skills. A $525 million Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow program will fund up to 80,000 new apprentice places in areas of skills shortage and provide the groundwork to deliver stronger skills well into the future. The government invested over $3 billion into the vocational education and training sector in 2018-19. Labor went to the last election with an agenda to increase taxes on retirees, housing, income, investments, family businesses, electricity and cars. Labor has learned nothing. The opposition continues to put politics ahead of Australia's national interests. Labor can't be trusted to manage our $1.9 trillion economy.</span>

                    </a>  by leaveâThis report contains a credible technical examination of legislation with Australia's obligations under international human rights law, as required under the committee's statutory mandate. It sets out the committee's consideration of 16 bills introduced into the parliament between 9 September and 12 September 2019 and seven legislative instruments registered on the Federal Register of Legislation between 2 and 8 August 2019. The committee is seeking further information in relation to three bills and has also reiterated its previous comments in relation to two bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to note that the committee has adopted a new approach to reporting on private members' and senators' bills. The committee has resolved that, where such bills appear to engageâand may even limitâhuman rights, it will generally list those bills in the advice-only section of the report and not substantively comment on them. But should the bills proceed to further stages of debate, the committee may request further information from the legislation proponent as to the human rights compatibility of the bill. The current report provides an example of this approach. The National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2) was introduced by a private senator. However, as this bill passed the Senate on 9 September, it is now, therefore, before the House. The committee is now seeking advice from the legislative proponent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also made concluding remarks in relation to five legislative instruments and two bills. Two of these instruments, the Australian Crime Commission Regulations 2018 and the Fisheries Management Regulations 2019, both allow for personal identifying information about persons suspected of crimes to be shared overseas. The committee has raised concerns, in relation to both of these instruments, about a lack of policy or guidelines in place to prevent such information being shared overseas where there's a risk that disclosing such information could expose a person to the death penalty or to torture, to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or to punishment. The committee has recommended that consideration be given to developing guidelines or legislative amendments to help ensure that information is not shared overseas in such circumstances. This is an issue the committee will continue to monitor. With these comments, I commend the committee's report No. 5 of 2019 to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  As I was saying, over nine days, 146 vehicles and 615 personnel participated. A number of those personnel were victims of the storms themselves, with 45 RFS personnel having damage to their own homes and cars. Trucks came from across the state to help our community. People rallied together and many spontaneously volunteered to help whoever was most in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Reynolds, the former minister for emergency management, visited Berowra with me in the weeks after the storm. She was amazed by the way the community had rallied, with local people putting on vests and joining the ranks of the emergency services for those days, helping to solve whatever problems they could for their neighbours. It was the largest uptake of spontaneous volunteers in the city metro area. Young and old filled sandbags or cleared debris. Minister Reynolds called it the 'Berowra model' of volunteering. Every door in the affected area was knocked; every home was offered help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to some of the key people involved in that initial response in Berowra. They are: Reinould Beijerinck, who runs the SES; Rolf Poole; Tony Hine; Craig Woon; Gordon Morgan; Graham Horne; Chris Mawn; James Logan; Murray Oakley; Andrew McCullough; and Adam Jones. I also want to note Mark Sugden, the fire control officer for the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai district. I also want to pay tribute to others in my community who are doing similar work every year, sometimes to help my constituents but sometimes doing work with trucks in other parts of the state, helping people in other parts of the country where there's a need. I think of people like John Hojel, the very long-serving fire control officer at the Hills District, and Evelyn Lester, the controller general of the SES in the Hills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to people who've worked, in the time after the storms, to keep supporting a community that's had a really tough year. They are business people like Tim Cummins, the manager of Bakers Delight in Berowra, who organised a day in which local businesses would raise funds for the RFS; Coho Cafe and the other local businesses that got involved in those efforts; and the remarkable Josi Fonti, at the Bendigo Bank, who provided torches and other emergency equipment to people and who continues to keep note of how the vulnerable residents are progressing. While I'm talking about amazing people involved in emergency services, I particularly want to note what a privilege it was this weekend to have been present at the awarding of the National Medal, 2nd clasp, to Tim Maffey at Neringah hospice for his over 30 years of work for the Hornsby/Kur-in-gai Rural Fire Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While many have got on with their lives and repairs have been made, still in my electorate there are homes that are waiting for repair and many people are wondering whether they'll be able to return to their homes. In some cases, families haven't been allowed back since the storm hit. Their houses have been left like a museum because of the asbestos. Berowra is a resilient place, with a strong community, but the road to recovery is long. It lasts much longer than the days covered by the media. After the first moment of response strikes, there's a long road of wrestling with insurance and trying to help people return to normal lives. It's important people know that they're not forgotten and that practical support is there when it's needed. That's why bills like this are so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A responsible government plans for risk so that when communities need support most it will be in a position to give that support. These bills are focused on the recovery phase of natural disasters, recognising that, when communities are facing some of the biggest challenges they'll ever face, the rest of the country must be positioned to help in tangible ways. The Emergency Response Fund will place $4 billion in a dedicated financial asset fund to be invested by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. That asset will then be used to provide long-term energy response and recovery. Alongside the fund, a special account will be created within Home Affairsâthe Home Affairs Emergency Response Fund Special Accountâwhich will receive dollars from the fund, at the request of the emergency management minister, for the purpose of funding responses to natural disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funds are coming from the Education Investment Fund; $4 billion that is currently uncommitted in that fund will be re-purposed. This has been the subject of some significant debate as this amendment has been discussed. The government hasn't entered into any new spending commitments under that fund since 2013. This doesn't mean that the government hasn't been spending money on higher education or higher education infrastructure. For instance, $150 million has been spent to support the relocation and redevelopment of the University of Tasmania's Launceston and Burnie campuses, and a further $30 million is earmarked for the establishment of a new Central Queensland School of Mining and Manufacturing alongside the $17.7 billion in the university sector in 2019, which is projected to grow to more than $19 billion by 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This fund will now be growing in perpetuity. It will be used in order to ensure that it becomes a fund that can make a long-term impact. Drawdowns on the funds will be restricted to $150 million each year for the first 10 years. After 10 years, in relation to emergency management, that can be reassessed. But the intention is that the fund will grow and be a stable asset base for future support when natural disasters occur. Investment in the fund will be the responsibility of the Future Fund Board of Guardians, chaired by former Treasurer Peter Costello. They will take carriage of this fund, along with the existing funds that they manage on behalf of the Australian government. The Future Fund will be responsible for the investment decisions but not the spending decisions of the fund. Decisions about the use of the funds will require formal government approval. The emergency management minister will take proposals to government for consideration, informed by the advice of the director-general of Emergency Management Australia. Information about the fund and its use will be publicly available. The emergency management minister will publish up-to-date information about the use of grants, and the Future Fund will give reports on investments that they make. All of this can give the community confidence that the government is serious about this investment on behalf of future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond immediate disaster response, the fund will do something important for recovering communities. It will allow for postdisaster resilience projects to be funded, which will help our communities to become more responsible and more prepared for disasters after they go through one. People say lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice, but unfortunately fires, floods and storms often do. If a community has been through a major disaster, it may well experience one again. Disaster-prone regions need to be able to not only rebuild, as they always have, but recover in ways that will strengthen their future resilience. These sorts of projects include things like financial management advice for bodies to improve their ability to manage low-income periods that occur because of disasters; building infrastructure that can withstand future disasters; and recovery grants to help primary producers re-establish their enterprises, perhaps in new ways. We know natural disasters won't disappear, but part of disaster preparation includes ensuring that recovery is done in a way that makes communities more resilient the next time a similar event occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian aid program currently supports all sorts of disaster resilience projects internationallyâprojects like floating gardens that can rise with floodwaters in disaster-prone parts of Bangladesh, and projects to teach people how to identify and prepare for risks in rural communities in the Pacific. We teach farmers to grow drought-resistant crops or to farm in ways that enable them to manage different types of weather events. This same principle of learning from disasters and rebuilding in a way that's more resilient than before will be at play in the Emergency Response Fund. When a significant or catastrophic natural disaster hits in Australia, the fund will enable postdisaster resilience projects which help us become a more resilient community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Watching the natural disasters affecting farmers and those battling with bushfires today must cause us to wish that an investment like this had been made years agoâdecades, even. There is no time like the present to invest in the future. The bills as presented by the government hand future generations important tools to help them manage and respond to the natural disasters that they will inevitably experience. Investing in the future and giving what we can to our children and grandchildren is one of the most important things that we can do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity particularly to commend the minister for emergency management, who does a wonderful job in this space. Seeing his own community affected in Queensland and seeing the very proactive approach that he's taken to the recent fires, I think, is a demonstration of his commitment to the portfolio, as he's been committed to other responsibilities he's had in this place. I commend these bills to the House, commend the minister for the work that he's done and ask all my colleagues to give them their full support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, are an appalling con trick, and they should not go unremarked or unchallenged by this House. The government pretends, as we've heard, that these are bills about disaster relief. Of course Labor supports the government helping communities affected by the disasters: while they're being experienced, as we know, right now around Australia; post-disaster recovery and resilience building; but, importantly, as the government conveniently ignores, we support resilience and mitigation before disasters happen, which these bills do nothing about.</span>

This is the latest attempt in the last six years by the government to abolish the Education Investment Fund. The government have had three goes at abolishing the EIF. In 2014 they were going to abolish it and create the Asset Recycling Fund. That was the first go. They couldn't get that one through the parliament, so they skulked away for a few years. They haven't spent a cent from the fund in the last six years, mind you. There has been $3.9 billion for education just sitting there. The government have done nothing with it. In 2017 the government thought they would give it another crack and pretend everyone has forgotten the first go. They came in and said, 'We're going to abolish this education fund and put it into the NDIS.' They pretended the NDIS wasn't funded. The parliament said: 'No. That's a really dumb idea, Government. Let's not do that.' So they skulked away again. Two years later they're back with a different excuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whichever way you look at it, this government has had an obsession in the last six years with abolishing the Education Investment Fund. That fund was set up in 2007 by then Treasurer Peter Costello. It had another nameâthe Higher Education Endowment Fund. It was supposed to be a future fund for research and knowledge infrastructure for the next generation. When Labor took office we broadened the fund to allow it to fund research institutes' and also universities' and vocational institutes' critical new facilities and capital investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The balance of the fund now is $3.9 billion. The government should be investing from this fund right now. They've been in government for six long, sad years now but have not spent a cent from this fund. Let's understand what kind of investment we're talking about. Pre-2013 there was $4.2 billion. There was $90 million to the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity; $40 million to the Hearing Hub at Macquarie University; $64 million to the La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science; $36.8 million to the National Centre for Synchrotron Science, which is in my previous electorate; and $62 million to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisationâreally important investments for the future knowledge capacity of the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this legislation passes, that legacy will be trashed and the fund will be no more. I think it's profoundly dumb. Education is critical for the future of our country. If we're going to sustain our place in the coming decades as a high-wage, high-skill knowledge economy, we're going to have to invest more in education. We know that our neighbours, partners and competitors around the Asia-Pacific or the Indo-Pacificâwhatever your region of choice is at the momentâare investing more in education. Yet this government is finding in budget after budget new ways to cut funding to education. It's pretty dumb.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those left-wing radicals at places like the IMF, the World Bank and even the Reserve Bank of Australia are saying that one of the most productive things we can do to increase our future economic growth is invest in human capital and infrastructure. This fund does both. It invests in the infrastructure that is critical to support future increases in human capital. The cuts are just dumb. And they're not alone. This is the largest in this budget that I can see, but it comes on top of other cuts to research funding in this budget. I think in the midyear financial update it was $328 million. Then, in just a few short months, the government saw fit to up the cut to university research funding to $345 million. There has been $2.2 billion cut, in effect, from universities through the caps on demand, through the caps on the number of people who can go there, denying places to around 200,000 Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is almost my favourite of the stupid cutsâ$6.73 million to ARC research funding. Who would bother with such a small cut out of these enormous funds that should be there? When you read the fine print you find that that's because, one year after restoring indexationâindexation just means that the money keeps up with growth in real termsâthe government cut the indexation. So the ARC got their indexation back for a year and then the government cut it again in this budget. Well done, Government!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $16.5 million out of the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Scheme. I want to read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> what Professor Emma Johnston AO, the President of Science and Technology Australia, said. She summed it up well.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Research at tertiary institutions is also severely hampered by the reallocation of $3.9 billion from the Education Investment Fund to a new Emergency Response Fund â¦ While it is important to support those affected by emergencies including floods and firesâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">taking funding away from education to support emergency responses is a false economy. STEM education should be supported in a way that increases our national capacity to predict, prevent and respond to the impacts of national emergencies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why does the government claim that this is about emergency response when they've had six years of trying desperately to get rid of the Education Investment Fund? It simply takes $3.9 billion and puts it into an emergency response fund. It's robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's a false choice, a pretend choice and a con trick. When you have a look at the state of the budget and think about the future challenges that the nation has, we in this parliament should not have to choose between funding education properly and funding emergency response. It's ridiculous; it's clear that we can and need to do both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even if you believe that it's necessary, that you had to do this, that we could no longer afford to fund education infrastructure in this country, the government's design is flawed. They've even got the detail of the bills' design wrong. I'll just point out two key waysâand I commend the speech from the member for Macquarie earlier today; it was an absolutely outstanding speech talking in detail about the flaws in these bills as they would affect her electorate and other communities around the country that suffer natural disasters in the way that her community does. Firstly, the fund can be used to build resilience only after a disaster, not before, yet stakeholders in the emergency management sector continually stress the need for much greater investment in disaster mitigation or resilience. This makes economic sense because, if you address the known risks, it lowers the cost and impact of future natural disasters and also puts downward pressure on insurance premiums.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, you can't provide more than $150 million a year from this fund. It's clear that the government is already going to have to make provision and make contingencies in their budget papers, like every government for time immemorial has done. When something unprecedented or way out of the box strikes, then the government always has to find more money. That's normal. That's what governments do. We saw that in Victoria with the Black Saturday bushfires. The government of the day had to defer infrastructure projects, reprioritise things and raise some taxes. The Gillard government had to do the same with the Brisbane floods. This fund won't be some panacea or fix-all for emergency response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what this legislation will do, if passed in this form, is see the death of the Education Investment Fund, which should continue to be there to provide funding for critical research infrastructure for universities, for vocational institutes, for TAFEs and so on. I know that Monash University, on the edge of my electorate, Chisholm TAFE, in the middle of my electorate, and Holmesglen TAFE, in the north of my old electorate, are just some of the local institutes that have benefited significantly from investments from this fund, let alone the regional universitiesâwhich we've heard a lot about in this debate and I'm sure we'll hear a lot more about in coming contributions and in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, these bills are a con trick. They're the latest instalment after six years by the government of trying to get rid of this fund. They should be able to walk and chew gum. We should be able to fund emergency response properly in this country without having to sacrifice critical education investments to do so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  In 2019, communities across Australia have been devastated by bushfires, by cyclones and by floods. Even as we speak, country towns in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales are continuing to battle blazes that have burnt an estimated 100,000 hectares of land, with houses lost and lives changed forever. My electorate knows all too well the devastation of bushfire, and we stand united with our cousins in Queensland and in New South Wales. It has been a national responseâand that is pleasing, and that is as it should beâfrom our country fire services, with crews from South Australia, including from my electorate, Victoria, Western Australia and even New Zealand giving up their time with their families and from work to help others in need. It will require a national response to mitigate the economic and emotional costs of recovering from natural disasters such as the fires burning in Queensland and New South Wales. This is what the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 seek to provide. The bills will establish the Emergency Response Fund and provide an initial credit of $4 billion to be distributed in annual amounts of up to $150 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The distribution of funds will occur by two streams. First, amounts payable by the Commonwealth through a grants scheme will be disbursed by the Home Affairs Emergency Response Fund. Second, funds will be distributed by the COAG Reform Fund for the purpose of making grants to the states and territories. Clause 20 of the bill sets out what measures may be eligible for funding under the Emergency Response Fund. These include grants to carry out a project, provide a service or adopt technology that is directed towards recovering from a natural disaster to improve postdisaster resilience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are very broad parameters. While I support the principle of the bills, I am concerned by both the source of the funds used for the initial credit, as many members have spoken about in this place already, and how the funds will be distributed in practice. Dealing first with the source of the funding: the government states that the initial credit of $4 billion will be sourced from the now-dormant Education Investment Fund. I acknowledge the government's assertion that this action will have no impact on the funding provided to the education sector. However, I am concerned that such a large sum of money has been lying dormant and unused for so long. I remember when the government was trying in this place to repurpose that funding for the NDIS. Particularly when so much of the government legislative agenda in recent times has focused on cost-saving measures, it's hard to understand why that funding has been sitting there unused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, I'd like to ensure that an appropriate portion of the annual distributions are allocated to preventive measures to lessen the impact of natural disasters on our communities. While providing financial assistance to individuals in the immediate aftermath of a disaster is a priority, we must also ensure that our communities are adapting to an ever-changing and drying climate and invest in resilience-building measuresâwhether that be weirs or whether it be a whole range of ways that we can ensure we can reduce our risk of natural disaster. However, I do hope that the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee inquiry process will delve into these issues. With my Centre Alliance colleagues in the other place, I will closely monitor the submissions provided and the evidence given at those hearings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the South Australian firefighters from my electorate of Mayo who have volunteered their time to assist their colleagues in the eastern states. Last Saturday afternoon, 55 of South Australia's Country Fire Service, Metropolitan Fire Service and Ambulance Service flew to South-East Queensland and replaced 55 of their colleagues who had already been battling bushfires. And last Sunday afternoon I had the privilege of attending the CFS awards ceremony at the Mount Compass War Memorial Hall. Those recipientsâthose receiving the National Medal, including their clasps for 20, 30 or 40 years of serviceâcollectively had 4,600 years of service that was recognised on that day. I give my heartfelt thanks and honour to those men and women who volunteer right across my community of Mayo to keep us safe, right across region 1. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I support the government's initiative in establishing an Emergency Response Fund that will help fund emergency responses and recovery following catastrophic natural disasters. This will be particularly necessary in light of the fires that are currently devastating parts of New South Wales and Queensland, and I hope those communities are able to receive the assistance they need. I wish them well, and our thoughts are very much with them as they recover from the fires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am extremely concerned, though, like many in the House, that the government has chosen to take the funds from the Education Investment Fund and about what that means for young people and their education opportunities in the future. There certainly is that question of why those funds have not been used when there have been so many cuts in so many sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I do support the bills, the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019âand I commend the government on the premise of these bills and similar bills, like the drought fund bill, which will help drought-stricken communities adapt to drought conditionsâboth bills go to the symptoms of a much greater problem. The effect of climate change in these disasters is plain to see for everyone. As the CSIRO has reported, Australia has already warmed by one degree, and the effects are drastic. We're now seeing longer fire seasons, worse droughts, floods, storms and cyclones, and these are projected to compound and get greater in severity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will list some of the climate-exacerbated events that we've recently had. In January 2018, we had extreme heatwaves. Penrith, in Sydney, reached a maximum of 47 degrees. Those hot conditions led to high bushfire danger and subsequent fires, leading to emergency warnings for Sherwood, Brimbago, Lowan Vale and McCallum. The fires affected 41 properties and destroyed five homes, 101 hectares of crops and an estimated 2,600 livestock. In March 2018, Tropical Cyclone Marcus hit the Northern Territory coast with winds of up to 260 kilometres per hourâthe strongest cyclone to hit Darwin since 1974âleading to insured losses of $61 million. On 20 December 2018, a series of severe storms brought torrential rainfall to the Hunter Valley, the Central Coast, Sydney and Wollongong. The Insurance Council of Australia declared the event a catastrophe, with estimated insured value losses of $871.3 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost to the Australian economy of these events is massive. Deloitte Access Economics reported that the total economic cost of natural disasters over the years to 2016 averaged $18.2 billion per yearâequivalent to 1.2 per cent of average GDP. This is projected to grow 3.4 per cent per year, to reach $39 billion by 2050. They also reported that over the last decade Queensland has borne most of the disaster costsâsome 60 per centâfollowed by New South Wales, which accounts for 17 per cent of the national cost. Extreme weather events like storms accounted for most of this, followed by flood events. With the projected increased likelihood of these events in certain areas, insurance premiums are growing at an alarming rate. In fact, some areas will no longer be insurable. In light of this, the Insurance Council of Australia, following the coalition's win in May this year, called on the returned government to make climate change mitigation a top priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government has committed, $150 million per annum to 2030, is just a fraction of the amount that will be needed to respond to these sorts of events, and it is simply unfair to leave the majority of the cost to the state governments. During the election, this government and its media allies repeatedly requested that climate action be costed, as if it were an investment into our future that was a luxury to be weighed up against the cost of business as usual. Let's be very clear: the cost of business as usual is not zero. The cost of business as usual is all of these reactive measures and the costs required to recover from these extreme weather events. According to our peak industry bodies, the most cost-effective response is prevention. This means more than the government providing funding after the event; instead, it must mean addressing the key exacerbating factor of extreme events, which is global warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that it is going to meet its Paris target of 26 to 28 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. This is contradicted by the figures from a number of organisationsâbut, regardless, it is not enough. The IPCC has indicated that many more reductions are needed, and this will be called for in 2020. The Paris agreement requires nations to commit to more reductions and for a plan to be put forward. This is called for by next year, 2020. We've heard nothing from this government on further commitments that it is willing to make. On behalf of all sensible Australians who are worried about our future, I call on this government to put a plan to parliament that is more ambitions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I rise to speak in relation to the Emergency Response Fund Bill 2019 and the Emergency Response Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. I want to put on the record my disappointment that the government's tactic is that it has to be one or the other. We all agree that we need an Emergency Response Fund and that the government needs to be doing more to support communities affected by emergencies and disasters and to support preparedness and work on mitigation. It's just so disappointing that again they try to wedge us in this place by taking the funding from another vital area, university infrastructure funding. I have a regional university campus in my electorate, the Bendigo campus of La Trobe University, that wants to expand, to build and to access the funds that have been put aside for such projects in the Education Investment Fund, which will now be abolished to create another fund. It's just disappointing that, again, after six years, we see this government steal from one pot of critical funding to fund another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the fund itself, these bills create the Emergency Response Fund to distribute up to $150 million per year for disaster recovery activities. This is in addition to the existing federal fund for disaster recovery efforts. I know that many, particularly in regional areas, have been calling for such a fund to be created for quite some time. As the climate disaster in our country unfolds and things start to become tougher in our regions, we are impacted by more and more extreme weather events and natural disasters, whether they be floods, fires, droughts or cyclones. It's hard to imagine any part of Australia these days that is not affected. In regional Victoria, particularly in central Victoria, in the last decade alone we've been hit by severe flooding, including in some parts of my electorate. We've also been hit by severe bushfires in some parts of my electorate. We have been less affected by drought; we've been fortunate to receive rain, particularly this year. However, to the north and to the west, drought has become a major problem. We are also being hit hard by mini-tornadoes, a term you never used to hear or see in local papers. But these days extreme weather events have become labelled in a way that we never thought possible. Tornadoes will indiscriminately choose a street, a house or a suburbânowhere elseâand just tear down everything in their paths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These areas require our urgent support, and that is why a fund like this is welcomed, because it will help these areas get back on their feet soon. Types of activities that could be funded are broad and include services and adopting technologies that can be directed towards recovery or building postdisaster resilience. I know that, after the devastation of the bushfires over a decade ago, parts of the postdisaster recovery and resilience programs were incredibly important. My electorate is home to FRRR, an organisation that partnered with the government at the time and has continued, for the last decade or so, to help run those programs, helping people with mental health and helping communities to rebuild and to tell their story. This is critical in the process of recovery. In rebuilding communities' human capital or their infrastructure capital, whether after a small disaster that affects only one part of a community or whether after a large disaster such as we have seen with bushfires or floods in Queensland, there is a role for the federal government to play.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst this fund is welcome, because it will help with flood levies and cyclone shelters and with ensuring that funding is provided after a disaster has struck and that the federal government is doing its role to be a funding partner, the problem is that it is coming at the expense of critical infrastructure that is needed in our universities. That's what disappoints me about this government. They are stealing from one sector to pay for another. Our universities do want to expand, to build and to upgrade to make sure that they have fit-for-purpose classrooms and the latest technology and that the graduates they are training have the skills and qualifications that are required for the jobs of the future. Yet what the government is proposing to do to fund the Emergency Response Fund is to cut the Education Investment Fund. Why does it have to be one or the other? Why can't it be both? Why does this government prioritise education funding over emergency response? Why can't it be both? People in my electorate are asking that question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see further investment into Bendigo La Trobe. The last time they received federal government funding was when Labor was last in government. That was to build the School of Rural Healthâa fantastic investment by the former Labor government, with the university. We now have a dental program based at Bendigo. We have every allied health that you could study. It is helping to bridge the gap we have in the regions in the rural health workforce. It was made possible because of an education investment funding stream of the previous government. Since this government has come to power they have frozen itânot a dollar has been spent. It is not because the universities haven't put forward projects. They have. At La Trobe they could not get the funding support from this government for their engineering building, so they looked to the state government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election we made a commitment to help fund a research institute that would focus on rural road trauma in order to make sure that we were partnering with health, with state and federal authorities, so that we could crack down, work out and resolve the tension that we have on our roads. This year, 201 people have been killed on Victorian roads, the majority of the fatalities being in regional Australia. We have a real crisis in road trauma on our regional roads. An institute would have been welcomed. We need funding to do that and a federal government that chooses to partner with regional universities to deliver that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is so disappointing that, to get the Emergency Relief Fund to ensure that our communities have the support they need post disaster, this government is stealing from another vital area of regional Australiaâthat is, from a fund that can help to support the growth of our universities. It is like the government forgets that, in a lot of these regional communities that are subject to the natural disasters that this fund would go towards, the universities are also big employers. It is not just in my electorate, where Bendigo La Trobe employs over 500 people. La Trobe has campuses in Shepparton and Wodonga, and we have Charles Sturt University, the University of New England and the Central Queensland University. The universities throughout regional Australia are the big employers in these towns. They want to be able to expand and grow. To do that, the Education Investment Fund could have been an avenue. It was funding that was set aside that this government never spent. Because they chose not to partner with universities, they now seek to abolish it to fund something else that is just as critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the abolition of this program, universities, TAFEs and research institutions have said that they will either cancel or postpone future infrastructure investment or upgrades. When we're going through a skills crisis, why would you put that pressure on our universities and TAFEs?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we've still got skills on the migration skills list that have been there for 10-plus years, why would you put that pressure on our vocational and university sector? We have so many ageing infrastructure challenges within our universities and TAFEs. We are not competing with the rest of the world. This government is not investing enough in those institutions to ensure that we have the buildings and the infrastructure that we need. And now those opposite are saying they're going to abolish this fund. It's terrible 'wedgislation'. It is terrible that the government is pitting our higher education and university sector against the need for emergency response funding. It's quite cynical of the government to behave this way. I believe the money is there in the budget. It's a massive federal budget that we have. The money is there. It comes down to priorities. It's disappointing that the government doesn't prioritise both these areas to ensure that we have adequate funding for both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Education Investment Fund was established by Labor in 2009, and it provided important capital to transform our education and research infrastructure to enable our universities to compete internationally. We need to continue to do that. We are falling behind the rest of the world. We should be ensuring that there is adequate funding available for our universities so that they can innovate and build the facilities that we need, particularly when we start to talk about natural disaster recovery and mitigation. Quite often we look to our universities for best practice and for research on how we can model and change going forward. Now we're limiting the capacity for university partners, because we've cut funding that could go towards it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a terrible record when it comes to supporting emergency response and relief. In my electorate, we used to host the Australian Emergency Management Institute on Mount Macedon. This government shut it down. It used to exist. It looked at best practice. It looked at mitigation. It looked at disaster recovery. It ensured that the people knew what to do on the day. After Black Saturday in Victoria, it did the modelling to ensure we never had a repeatâthat we could get the people out early and that we could get the water on the ground as quickly as possible. We see the work that they did saving lives today, in Queensland last year and this year, and in New South Wales this year. And this government shut it down! And here we are, how many years later, being led to believe that those opposite now care and want to do something about it. They did nothing to save the Australian Emergency Management Institute on Mount Macedon. It was actually built on ground which was hit quite hard by fire many decades ago. The Victorian government, however, bought it from the federal government and reopened the facility so that our states do have a place to go. The federal loss is Victoria's gain. At least we still have an institute where we can have these discussions and come up with best practice. And I am sure that the people involved in this fund will be there regularly, meeting with their counterparts from around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minute that I have left, I again urge the government to reconsider what it's doing. We need both funds. We need infrastructure investment and funding for our universities and TAFEs. We are falling behind. We need to ensure that we have the facilities, the courses, the materials and the teachers and that we're doing the research required for the future of work and for future industries. Equally, we need the federal government to be a proper partner with our state and local governments and to fund emergency response. We need them to be able to do both, and both should be a priority. Whilst not opposing these bills in the House, Labor have already signalled that we will move detailed amendments because we don't believe it should be a case of one or the other. We believe that both should be a priority of the government, and it's unfair that those opposite are trying to rob universities and TAFEs to fund emergency response relief.</span>

These bills will secure an additional source of sustainable funding for emergency response and recovery following a natural disaster that has a significant or catastrophic impact in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is providing a significant upfront investment of $4 billion, which will be invested by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The board currently manages six other investment funds on behalf of the Commonwealth and has a proven and strong reputation for prudently investing money. In the event that a community experiences a natural disaster with a significant or catastrophic impact, the government will have access to a maximum of $150 million per year to fund emergency response and natural disaster recovery. Through grants or other funding arrangements, the Emergency Response Fund will be able to support the delivery of projects and services or promote the adoption of technology directed towards achieving recovery from natural disasters. The types of assistance provided could include but are not limited to additional recovery grants, economic aid packages and support to affected communities or industry sectors to help build their resilience to future natural disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Emergency Response Fund demonstrates the government's long-term commitment to assisting communities across Australia that have been significantly affected by a natural disaster. Transferring the balance of the Education Investment Fund to the Emergency Response Fund will not affect the government's funding and investment in the higher education sector. We are committed to a world-class higher education system and are investing a record $17.7 billion in the university sector in 2019. This is projected to grow to more than $19 billion by 2022. We have also made significant education infrastructure investments, recently announcing around $180 million in funding for projects in Tasmania and Central Queensland. This means the uncommitted funds in the Education Investment Fund will now be used to build a sustainable source of additional funding to help communities recover from the impacts of natural disasters. Once again, I thank all members for their contributions and commend the bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  Labor will support the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment Bill 2019 in this place. This bill will enable the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation to provide guarantees to improve housing outcomes and undertake research into housing affordabilityâwhat the government calls the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. The legislation does not address much of the detail and administration of the scheme, and this will be handled through the investment mandate and developed by the corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the bill's explanatory memorandum and the government's other public commitments that the new scheme will allow first home buyers to purchase properties without the need to pay lenders mortgage insurance or meet the standard 20 per cent deposit requirement. Applicants will only have to provide a five per cent deposit, but there are some rules. The scheme is to be capped at 10,000 purchases per annum, and eligible applicants must have earnt less than $125,000 in the previous financial year as a single or $200,000 as a couple. The new scheme will be funded through the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As the explanatory memorandum makes clear, the scheme will require an update to the NHFIC's investment mandate, and we understand that this will go through a process of public consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate last week voted to conduct an inquiry into this bill, which will report before the next sitting fortnight, and that inquiry may find that there are improvements which could be made to this bill. We look forward to the committee's findings and also to hearing from the government how this scheme will be implemented. It is appropriate that this bill be considered by a Senate committee, because we must ensure that this new policy will provide a maximum benefit to first home buyers while appropriately managing the risk to the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to remember that, under this government, housing affordability has continued to worsen. That's why I move a second reading amendment standing in my name. I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) a report released last week by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that in 2017-18 over 1 million low-income households were in financial housing stress and that 43.1 per cent of low income households renting in Australia are suffering rental stress; and</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government we have seen first home buyers left behind. Today, the percentage of Australians who own their own home has dropped to its lowest level since Robert Menzies was Prime Minister back in the sixties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is young peopleâpeople in their 20s and 30sâwho are finding it hardest to get their foot onto the property ladder. In Sydney it takes more than 11 years to save for a standard 20 per cent housing deposit. In Melbourne it takes more than 10 years, in Adelaide more than eight and in Brisbane and Perth more than seven. This is cutting generations of Australians out of the housing market. As research released by the University of Sydney last week revealed, whether someone owns property is the greatest indicator of their wealth. There are even specific ways to break up this system based on whether someone is an investor or a homeowner, a mortgage holder or an outright owner. The lowest, according to this research, are renters and the homeless. This needs to be urgently addressed, and Labor looks forward to the Senate inquiry's findings on the proposed new scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just first home buyers, though, who are doing it tough under this government. The number of people in Australia who are behind in their mortgage payments today is at its highest level since the global financial crisis. This is extremely concerning given that we are currently experiencing the lowest interest rates in decades. Yet, when wages are flat and the cost of living continues to increase, is it any wonder that Australians are struggling to meet their repayments? Renters are doing it tough, too, as a report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed last week. In 2017-18, 11.5 per cent of households spent 30 per cent to 50 per cent of their gross income on housing costs, with another 5.5 per cent spending 50 per cent or more. One million low-income households were in financial housing stress in 2017-18, and today we have more homeless Australians than ever before. The last census recorded the number of homeless Australians as more than 116,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not good enough. There is no way to put a positive spin on this figure, as the assistant minister tried to do. There is no way to put a positive spin on any of these figures. Labor is hopeful that this legislation and subsequent policy may help improve housing affordability and increase the number of first home buyers. That is why I repeat: we are supporting the bill in this place. We look forward with interest to the Senate committee's findings and will consider all the findings carefully when the bill is considered by the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  Well, I could wax lyrical all day about the benefits of living and working in northern Tasmania. But, like so many in my community, I know that one of the best advantages of living in my electorate of Bass is the ability to achieve the great Australian dream of buying your first house. Launceston, the largest city in the Bass electorate and the largest regional city in the state, offers incredible proximity to hospitals, schools and the University of Tasmania, as well as beautiful parks, a fantastic aquatic centre and so much more. So it's no surprise that the city has seen a rise in property prices over the past few years. It has been described by some in the industry as Australia's best-performing market for 2018 because of the housing affordability and strong buyer market. Compared with Hobart, where the housing boom has made it increasingly difficult to enter the market, buying property in Launceston or indeed in one of the many other areas in the electorate is still achievable. Whether you're looking for suburban living in Launceston, beachside beauty in Bridport or a tree change in one of our many stunning rural farming communities, northern Tasmania really does offer it all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, while the property market might still be viewed as widely affordable, particularly against other areas in Australia, I want to ensure that my constituents are able to reach their goal of purchasing their first home. This is where the Morrison government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme will provide a benefit to many in my electorate. I enthusiastically support the policy intent of the scheme, which is to assist first home buyers who are having difficulty purchasing their first home to get their start in the housing market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research has indicated that the ability to save a deposit is a greater constraint on homeownership for first home buyers than the ability to service a home loan. Although not always the case, I know that many first home owners in my community are often young couples or singles in their 20s who may still be working their way through an apprenticeship or have young children and may only have one full-time income. Even for those on a good salary and in solid jobs, the rising cost of rent in Launceston can be a barrier when trying to save for a deposit. The cost of renting can often be more expensive than mortgage payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme provides eligibility for singles earning under $125,000 a year or couples with a combined income of $200,000, which, as many of my regional colleagues will know, makes this scheme even more appealing than in capital cities. For these reasons alone, the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme will truly assist those in my community who are working hard to save the amount needed for a deposit. Where 20 per cent is often the minimum required to gain access into the market, the scheme will allow a first home buyer to enter the market at a much reduced five per cent deposit and avoid the extra cost of borrowing lenders mortgage insurance. I imagine this scheme may also offer relief to some parents, who, after claiming back bedrooms and the quiet calm of their house after their children move out, are seeing their children move back in and taking over the Netflix account as they furiously save for a house deposit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware that there are concerns that the scheme may encourage first home buyers to take on more debt than they would otherwise, but the checks and balances are in place in this bill. Home loans covered by the scheme will still be subject to serviceability assessments and responsible lending obligations. Additionally, the property price caps will limit the maximum size of loans that can be taken out under the scheme. The aforementioned price caps will be set on a regional basis, reflecting the affordability of different property markets. The government will determine what the price caps will be, after further consultation with stakeholders. I am confident that this will bring the best outcome for those in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that there are queries surrounding how the scheme will affect the lenders mortgage insurance sector, but I am confident in the scheme's design to complement rather than compete with lenders mortgage insurance. This scheme will be small in size, limited to 10,000 guarantees a year, and is not targeted at those that would otherwise be able to enter the housing market with the help of lenders mortgage insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As previously mentioned, the electorate of Bass, while still considered affordable compared to many other regions in Australia, is becoming increasingly more expensive as the property market heats up in Northern Tasmania. I'm pleased to note that the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment Bill 2019 also gives effect to the government's election commitment to establish a research capacity within the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. This research capacity, which will examine housing demand and supply and affordability across Australia, will complement existing housing related research and will be critical in addressing housing affordability in years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme benefits not only those individuals and couples looking to enter the housing market for the first time but also our valuable local building and construction industries. Tradies are an important part of Northern Tasmania's culture. The ongoing confidence of the building and construction industry in Northern Tasmania was a recurrent theme during the recent election campaign, and I spent a lot of time speaking with local builders, plumbers and tradespeople like Steve Simeoni of Tas City Building, about how confidence and ongoing buoyancy in the market is driving investment and jobs growth. Steve told of growing his business from just four employees a few years ago to now 40 employees, with further growth potential ahead. It was a similar story with many other tradespeople I spoke to as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are currently seeing strength in the local building industry in Northern Tasmania providing jobs and economic stimulus. But it is important to cast an eye to sustaining that into the future. Master Builders Australia have been calling for measures such as the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme because, as was pointed out in the election campaign, this government's targeted and practical approach will do more to assist first home buyers than doubling capital gains tax and restricting negative gearing could ever achieve. The scheme will be welcomed by home builders and tradespeople, because a strong building economy provides stimulus for the housing market. I wholeheartedly support this bill and I applaud the Morrison government for supporting those around Australia who are seeking to buy their own piece of the great Australian dream.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment Bill 2019 because in my community, like far too many communities around Australia, housing stress is a real issue. But as the second reading amendment, which I wholeheartedly support, also makes clear, homelessness is growing in Australia and it's a real problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness in the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula region is a problem, but, in particular, and very sadly, youth homelessness is a problem. We know young people are over-represented in the Victorian homeless population, with 26 per cent of those experiencing homelessness being under 25 years of age. In my community, in the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula region, it means that approximately 220 young people are experiencing homelessness at any point timeâyoung people, people aged between 15 and 24 years of age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016-17, 4,060 young people aged between 15 and 24 years of age went to specialist homeless services in the Bayside Peninsula area asking for help. This year already, the services in my electorateâthe hardworking people who are there to help those in needâhave come to me and said that there is a visible increase in the number of people sleeping rough. Unfortunately, those of us who live in the wonderful Frankston and Mornington Peninsula region can see that for ourselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the people that the services in my electorate are helping, those 4,060 young people aged between 15 and 24 years, almost twice as many are womenâtwice as many! These statistics are not just statistics. They are real people with real lives, with almost inevitably devastating stories. There are stories like the one that I am going to present to this chamber, to this parliament, now. The names have been changed to protect people's privacy, but this is a real story in the real words of an 18-year-old girl from my electorate. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My name is Sarah. I am almost 18, in year 12 and work at a restaurant on Saturdays. I want to be a nurse. I had to leave home a couple of months ago because my step-dad was very violent and I was frightened. I went to my Grandma's for a while, but she lives in a retirement village so I wasn't allowed to stay. I moved in with a school friend and slept on her bedroom floor for a few weeks, but her parents said I had to leave. So I went to live with a guy from work, Jack, who said I could stay if I helped with the housework and walked his dog. It was okay for the first week, until he started pressuring me for other things. His neighbours let me stay in their garage for a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After that, I couldn't find anywhere else to stay so my school counsellor brought me to the local homelessness service. There were lots of people waiting for help, and it was kinda scary. The worker was really nice but said there were no places for me to go, because all the youth refuges in the state were full. She said they couldn't put me in a motel because of my age, and I don't have enough money to rent a place, even if I could find one. I only have about $80 a week from my job, because my mum won't sign the forms for me to get youth allowance from Centrelink. She says I should go back home, but she doesn't understand how scared I am of Mick, especially when he's drinking. She won't stick up for me because it's Mick's house, and I think she's scared of him too. I feel like I'm always on edge, and I can't eat, study, or sleep when I'm there. The housing worker called child protection but they won't help me because I'm nearly 18. They're going to talk to my little brother at his school though, so maybe someone will help him. The worker said when I'm 18 they can help me apply for public housing, but the waiting list is really long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So I went back to Jack's. He works at night, so I felt okay then. But when he got home I tried to stay out of his way or I'd sleep in the cubby house in the neighbour's yard. They didn't know. It was cold, but it felt safer than inside Jack's house. I wasn't getting my school work done, and I'm so behind. I was very anxious and depressed, and felt so alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last week, I tried to kill myself and Jack called an ambulance. I stayed in the mental health ward for four days, but this afternoon they discharged me and sent me back to the homelessness service. The hospital also set me up an appointment at headspace next week. The housing worker let me charge my phone, and found a bed for me in the city. I've never been there on my own before. She gave me directions, a food voucher and a Myki card. My school bag is still at Jack's place. I'll have to miss work this weekend because it is too far away. I have to come back on Monday so they can see if there is anywhere else then, because a bed in the refuge is only for the weekend. They said there aren't any youth refuges around here, so I really don't know where I'm going to end up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very brave young woman. She has told her story to the workers, and they have brought it to me so that I can bring it to our federal parliament. These are real people that we're talking about when we talk about homelessness, when we talk about housing stress and when we talk about trying to live on $40 a day on Newstart. These are real people. They are young people. They are people who have ambitions, hopes and dreams. They are people that we in this place of all places need to be standing up for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When a young person is homeless, as you've just heard, it disrupts their education and makes it harder for them to find employment. Sarah wants to have a go. She is having a go. But who's helping her? You just don't get a go. As the member for Lilley said in her first speech, life is not that benign, but it is our job to be here for young people like Sarah so that she can make her dreams reality. She doesn't need to live every day with her safety, her physical and mental health, and her general wellbeing at risk, but she does. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is when we come to intergenerational disadvantage in our communities. We know that young people who are homeless are more at risk of becoming homeless when they become an adult. We need to stop the cycle of disadvantage and the cycle of homelessness. Early intervention is essential for homelessness. It's essential for people to get a good education and a good job and to be able to afford a home. We have to do more and we have to do better. This place has to do better on behalf of the people we are here to represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise these stories in my electorate today because I am here to support 10 local community and government organisations that have come together on the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula for the Youth2 Campaign for homelessness to call for bipartisan support from government at all levels for youth crisis accommodation and transitional housing in my electorate, in my area. I also stand here for all people across Australia who are in the same situation. I am the voice today of the Youth2 Campaign. Their call for action asks for two, in my opinion, very reasonable things: funding to build and operate two supported crisis accommodation facilities, with 24/7 active staffing, located near Frankston and Rosebud in my area and a youth foyer connected with education providers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These additional investments would align and complement the Victorian state government's agenda on homelessness. I know that our local state member for Frankston, Paul Edbrooke, is a huge champion for these sorts of services and is working as hard as he can to bring them to our electorate, along with Sonya Kilkenny, the member for Carrum. I applaud the state Labor government for all the work that they're doing in this area. They have a homeless and rough-sleeping action plan. And they are working to implement the recommendations from the family violence royal commission. They know and we know that more needs to be done.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without investment in responses to prevent homelessness it will cost all of us dearly. According to a report published by the Swinburne Institute for Social Research the cost to the Australian economy of health services associated with young people experiencing homelessness is an average of $8,505 per person per year, or $355 million across all young people aged 15 to 24 accessing special homelessness services. That is an economic argument, but there is a moral and ethical argument and imperative for us to do more. So I'm standing here as the new federal member for Dunkley saying that I am willing to put out my hand and work with anyoneâto work with our state Labor members, the state Liberal members in my electorate and those opposite. We have to do something so that young people like Sarah don't have to go through what she has gone through.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment Bill 2019 is about making that first home purchase more achievable for 10,000 first home buyers a year. It's about giving first home buyers, young families wanting to get ahead and start their lives, the opportunity to do so through purchasing their home with a deposit of just five per cent. I know the importance for families and young people of having the security of a home. The Prime Minister knows the importance. He announced this very initiative right in my electorate of Lindsay, in a growing suburb called Caddens where many young people are aspiring to buy their own home. This is what Lindsay and Western Sydney are about: people who are working hard to get ahead, commuting out of our area for a good job. That is why we on this side are also making record investments in infrastructure, such as the Western Sydney International Airport and the North South Rail, because we want to make life even better for people living in Western Sydney. We can do this and help people into their first home only because of our strong budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill expands the current functions of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, the NHFIC. The Morrison government will consult with Treasury, the NHFIC and stakeholders to make sure that the allocation process is accessible and efficient for first home buyers across the country and in my seat of Lindsay. The scheme is subject to maximum income and dwelling price thresholds to ensure that only first home buyers purchasing modest properties will be supported. The scheme will also be subject to an independent review within three years of its commencement. In the housing sector it is important that we keep up with future challenges and demands, and this review will ensure that proper procedure is followed. The NHFIC will be responsible for choosing a limited panel of lenders who will offer guaranteed loans, based on criteria such as loan pricing, standards of customer care, diversification of lenders and regional coverage. The Prime Minister noted in his announcement of the scheme that preference will be given to smaller lenders. NHFIC will seek participation from both large banks and smaller lenders, including non-bank lenders. This increases market competitiveness and ensures that Australians are provided with the best options available to enter the housing market. The scheme is designed to complement rather than compete with lenders mortgage insurance. It will be small in size, as I said, limited to 10,000 guarantees per year, and is not targeted at those who would otherwise be able to enter the housing market with the help of lenders mortgage insurance. We are making sure that people who struggle to get into the housing market are given the chance to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This expanded function of the NHFIC means high-quality research into housing affordability, supply and demand. As Western Sydney continues to grow, this is going to be very important. As someone who worked in the community housing sector, I know how important housing affordability is to people living in Western Sydney and in my community of Lindsay. An important aspect of the housing market is to assess how we can keep up with the increasing population and the demand for affordable, reliable housing. NHFIC's new research function would be seen as a centre for excellence for housing demand, supply and affordability in Australia, highlighting current and potential gaps between housing supply and demand. I've worked in a research based organisation at an academic institution. The research that will come out of this centre of excellence is absolutely essential in getting our future plans right and will help inform an evidence based approach to housing demand and affordability, and I very much look forward to seeing its work in practice. NHFIC will establish close relationships with other research organisations and stakeholders to ensure they complement the existing research and add value where it is most needed. This research will ensure that our Morrison government can prepare for the challenges and demands of the future in the housing market and implement necessary reforms like the ones we are introducing today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, as I said, expands the existing functions of the NHFIC where it has been utilised to help increase the supply of affordable housing. I have seen firsthand the benefits of affordable housing in communities, particularly for key workers: police officers, nurses and other people who need to live close to where they work. I've also seen it at its best when affordable housing has helped women escaping domestic violence and older people who are living on their own. In both these circumstances, lives have been changed because of access to affordable and secure housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NHFIC's $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility provides finance for critical infrastructure to support new housingâin particular, affordable housingâand to bring forward the supply of such housing. The Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator provides cheaper and longer-term finance for registered community housing providers, enabling them to improve housing outcomes for people in important communities like mine. These providers are non-government organisations, generally not for profit, which provide subsidised housing for people on very low or moderate incomes and for people with additional needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A capacity-building program for registered community housing providers to assist them to develop their financial and management capabilities in support of a NHFIC loan application is absolutely essential. I think this is a really important part of NHFIC's scope. Community housing providers are often experts in providing housing and homelessness services to people in communities but not necessarily experts on the financing side, so this expertise is absolutely essential in developing our community housing sector in Australia. Under the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator, NHFIC is saving registered housing providers millions of dollars in financing costs and giving them decade-long certainty, which is absolutely important, over their loan facilities, which are critical to helping accelerate and increase the supply of social and affordable housing. To date, NHFIC financing is supporting the delivery of an additional 560 social and affordable rental dwellings, and this is just the start. I've seen it in practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic impact of people not being able to access affordable homes or rental homes is significant. Often, at an older stage of life or during stressful times, having your own home can make a world of difference. That's why I'm proud to back this very important reform. In May the Minister for Housing and Assistant Treasurer visited Lindsay, where we were able to see firsthand Evolve's social and affordable housing apartments. It's always great to see these things and hear the personal stories of how community housing has helped people get back on their feet and towards financial and housing independence. Given that the minister and I both share a passion for the issue of affordable housing and ensuring more first home buyers can get into the market, it is wonderful today to be able to commend this bill to the House and to commend the work of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. I look forward to seeing more young Australians entering the housing market, particularly in my community of Lindsay.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  Young people face a challenging road to homeownership. While acknowledging that housing affordability can be a challenge to capture and measure, the Reserve Bank of Australia have found evidence that housing has never been less affordable for first home buyers in Australia. Their research shows that young buyers have to save for increasingly large deposits, which means spending longer in the increasingly expensive private rental market and devoting more and more of their income to their short-term housing expenses rather than accumulating savings for that elusive housing deposit. Unsurprisingly, this has been borne out in the 2016 ABS census data, which shows that homeownership rates among younger households have decreased consistently over the past two years, with only 66 per cent of households owning their own home. Meanwhile, the most recent ABS data shows that the proportion of Australian households that are renting has increased from 27 per cent in 1998 to 32 per cent in 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is consistent with the experience of constituents in my electorate of Mayo. I recently attended a housing roundtable aimed at developing a South Australian housing and homelessness strategy. What was clear was that, for the Adelaide Hills and Fleurieu region, the private rental market is increasingly unaffordable for young people. Assuming they can even find a rental property, they are then devoting more than a third of their income just to meet the costs of housing, and this makes it incredibly difficult to save up the 20 per cent deposit required to purchase their first home. While Adelaide may have lower house prices, we also have lower annual incomes than the eastern states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment Bill 2019, seeks to lower some of the barriers through two functionsâfirst, undertaking research to better understand housing affordability and, second, establishing a First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. Under the scheme, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation will provide a guarantee on eligible loans equal to the difference between the depositâof at least five per centâand 20 per cent of the property purchase price. This measure is described in the explanatory memorandum to the bill as 'broadly consistent with a parental guarantee'. We now have the legislative equivalent of the intergenerational equity referred to by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. This suggests that the scheme is not targeted at those who are most in need of financial assistance but rather at individuals who are perhaps already on their way to saving for their house deposit, and that it will accelerate purchase for a small group of people who can potentially already afford a home although it may still be some years in the making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the scale of the scheme could be described as less than ambitious, with only 10,000 guarantees to be made available per annum. I do hope that, if this is a successful scheme, the government will look to expand it. The demand for guarantees will far outstrip the supply. Even the explanatory memorandum states that since the scheme was announced in May there has been 'a high degree of community interest'. While access to the scheme is limited to those individuals who earn an annual income of less than $125,000â$200,000 for a coupleâgiven the relatively high income threshold the scheme is clearly going to be popular with would-be first home buyers. The government states that placing pricing caps on amounts that can be borrowed will enable these guarantees to be funnelled to those who are most in need, so that's good to hear. I understand that pricing caps will be determined by reference to regions, but it is unclear what the regions are and who determines the regional boundaries. Similarly, who determines the pricing cap and by reference to what framework?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill provides for 10,000 guarantees to be distributed among states and territories. I note it does not provide for equal representation here. The places should be distributed according to state and territory populations. I'm concerned that we might see a push towards many places going to the eastern states. We know that Australia is a large place, with many areasâincluding Tasmaniaâwhere housing affordability is a challenge. I'd also like to see it stretch out beyond metropolitan Australia, because we know that many young people in the regions are also hoping to buy their first home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Mayo, the lack of affordable private rentals and the complete absence of appropriate public housing mean that our young people are spending more of their income on private rentals, making saving for a home incredibly difficult. Combine this with increased transport costs that accompany living in a rural or regional area and the prospect of saving enough money for a 20 per cent housing deposit is simply a pipedream. It's really important in this place that we don't let the dream of home ownership become an elusive dream, because we know that home ownership really is one of the greatest tools that you can have for financial stability and for emotional and relationship stability. Another fact that's come to my attention is that, when families rent privately and have to move around regularly, the children also have to move schools regularly, and that's not good for the children's educational stability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that we need to do much more in this place to turn around the decline in Australian home ownership. I support the government's measures here to address this, but I do think there is much more that we can do. We need to look at a suite of measures, from social housing to making sure that we have more stock available, because it's always a supply and demand issue. Home ownership has always been part of the Australian psyche. I'd like to finish with a little part of Sir Robert Menzies's 'Forgotten people' speech from 1942:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A suitably empowered Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports will provide an additional, independent layer of accountability and assurance over the regulation of Australia's livestock exports. The Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Bill 2019 will provide greater assurance in the regulation of live animal exports and broader animal welfare issues. It will do this by providing the inspector-general with the necessary independence from government and the powers to deliver a robust accountability and assurance function. An inspector-general will promote continual improvements in the regulatory practice, performance and culture of the Department of Agriculture in its role as the regulator of Australia's livestock exports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this bill will enable the inspector-general to review the administration of provisions relating to the export of livestock under the current regulatory framework. The regulatory framework is established by the Export Control Act 1982 and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By its nature, export of livestock presents a high risk to animal health and welfare. There have been failures to comply with animal welfare standards and concerns over the regulatory response. Australians were appalled in 2018 when they saw footage of sheep dying on voyages to the Middle East on the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> in 2017. Many were further angered by their assessment that the mortality incident reports did not match the footage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department's focus on trade facilitation means that it is balancing competing factors in its role as the regulator of live animal exports. Establishing an inspector-general is part of a broader strategy to develop and maintain an effective regulatory culture that will deliver animal welfare outcomes consistent with the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock and the best available science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In April 2018, governance expert Mr Philip Moss AM was asked to conduct a Review of the Regulatory Capability and Culture of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in the Regulation of Live Animal Exports. The government accepted all recommendations from this review when it was delivered in October 2018. Mr Moss recommended that an independent external entity, known as the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports, oversee the department in its role as the regulator of livestock exports. The independent oversight and evaluation provided by a statutory office is necessary to provide a further layer of assurance over Australia's livestock export management system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the Moss review the department has formed an Animal Welfare Branch, appointed a principal regulatory officer and is busy implementing the balance of the recommendations. The Animal Welfare Branch is driving a greater focus on animal welfare, including animal welfare indicators that are based on science and focused on the wellbeing of the animals, rather than mortality. The principal regulatory officer is driving a culture of greater professionalism, improved cohesion and a contemporary regulatory approach as a priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year the department appointed an interim Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports, to begin the important work we expect the statutory inspector-general to undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will enable the Minister for Agriculture to appoint the inspector-general, make other arrangements in relation to this appointment and to terminate an appointment if necessary. It will also provide the minister with the power to make rules that set out detailed requirements relating to the role of the inspector-general and the conduct of reviews. The bill will empower the inspector-general to review the performance and functions, or exercise of powers, by officials under the Export Control Act and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act. In addition the bill will compel a person to answer questions, and give information or documents to the inspector-general where the inspector-general has reasonable grounds for making the request. A civil penalty may apply where a person fails to comply. The bill will establish the basis for other matters such as information sharing, reporting and protection from civil liability.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Livestock exports are a legitimate business option for our farmers and were worth over $1.7 billion in 2017-18. The livelihoods of farmers and regional businesses across Australia, thousands of jobs, depend on the livestock trade.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are real people with real bills to pay. Any decisions regarding livestock exports must not be taken lightlyârather, decisions must be based on science and evidence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The calls to ban livestock exports disregard the value of this trade to our farmers and others in rural and regional Australia. Banning, or even suspending, livestock exports would simply be a 'knee-jerk' reaction, and would be a poorly considered decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's amazing how quickly we have forgotten the 2011 suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia and its impacts on farming families. These impacts were felt through the whole supply chain and included businesses that provide transport, mustering, feed and agistment services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the revelation in April 2018 of conditions on the voyage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> to the Middle East in the 2017 northern summer, the government moved quickly to make changes to improve the welfare of our exported livestock. Independent observers were immediately placed on vessels carrying our livestock to the Middle East and information on what they found is now being published on the department's website. There was an increased focus on heat stress management. This included requiring more space for sheep travelling to the Middle East during the northern summer and independent audits of pen air turnover by qualified personnel. These changes align with the recommendations from the McCarthy review of sheep exports to the Middle East during the northern summer, all of which the government accepted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review of the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock is being undertaken in two parts: the final report on the sea transport component was released in March 2019 and recommendations from that tranche of work are being progressively implemented. A review air transport element is underway by an independent technical advisory committee and it is anticipated that its report will be finalised shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A review of the heat stress risk assessment model was undertaken by a technical reference panel and completed in May 2019. The department will be consulting stakeholders on options for implementing the recommendations from that review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of these measures is critical and we will do what is necessary to support our farmers and others involved in the trade and maintain our reputation as a world leader in good animal welfare practices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is another part of the government's plan to address animal welfare concerns with livestock exports. We need to ensure that there are appropriate arrangements to oversee the Department of Agriculture in its role as regulator of livestock exports.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government supports the farmers who rely on livestock exports, and the exporters who do the right thing.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  Speaking to the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Bill brings me a great sense of regret, but it also brings me some sense of joy, because this bill represents a total capitulation on the part of this government over the question of an Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports. I'm pleased to be able to follow the ministerânot something we often have the opportunity to do in this place, because bills are usually adjourned for some time after the minister makes his initial contribution on the second reading. He talked a lot about culture, and I'll certainly be saying something about culture during my contribution to this very, very important debate. But I want to start with a little bit of history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011 Australians watched some terrible footage on their television screens. That footage involved shocking cruelty towards animals in abattoirs in Indonesia. It was most confronting. Even the most hardened of us, I believe, found that footage confronting. It caused a shocking fuss here in Parliament House, as it should have, as the government of the day scrambled to work out how to fix what was obviously a very serious problem and an issue that was weighing heavily on the minds of a very large number of Australians. Not all of them were animal activists. Ordinary Australians going about their hard work and their business were appalled by what they saw on their television screens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great challenge for the Labor government of the day was to work out how to fix the problem given that the issue was extraterritorialâit was happening in another countryâand was therefore an issue over which we had no control whatsoever. The only option the government had was to at least pause the trade so that leverage could be used against our friends and neighbours to have them clean up the mess that was occurring in that country. That's what a Labor government did, for four or five weeks, while we cleaned up that messâa mess, you could argue, that we'd inherited from the Howard government, which had been in power for 11Â½ years and which had presided over a number of animal welfare incidents but which had not done one thing to ensure that they didn't occur again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't just ask our friends to fix the problem, though; we helped to fund the repair that was required in Indonesia. We contributed significant amounts of money to help them help themselves. History tells us now that a Labor government, acting swiftly, pausing for only a relatively short time, was able to fix the problem. Not only that; it was able to put the live cattle trade on a sustainable footingâa $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion trade that still thrives today because of a Labor government. That pause caused the live cattle sector and, indeed, the cattle sector generally, because of the impact on supply and demand, very considerable pain, which is still felt by cattle producers today. Some of those cattle producers will never fully recover from what happened in 2011; I am more than willing to concede that. Again, I say that what happened in 2011 should never have been necessary, but it was necessary because the Howard government was asleep at the wheel for 11Â½ years and ignored the incidents it had presided over during that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the response of those who sit opposite? They use the incident of 2011 on every occasion to remind cattle producers of that time and to blame the Labor Party for what happened, even though it had its beginnings in the period under John Howard and it was left to a Labor government to put the cattle trade on a sustainable footing. How dare they use every country visit, every election campaign, every dinner, every luncheon and every bill in this place, whether it is on GMO or on health, to talk about what happened in 2011, as if those cattle producers didn't suffer enough pain than to have that mob over there constantly reminding them about it and blaming somebody else!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, unless the member for Flynn is speaking on this billâI suspect he is not; I believe he might be in here doing his dutyâI see no member of the National Party on the speakers list tonight. Interestingly, I rarely see members of the National Party on the speakers list for any bills anymore. They've taken their bat and gone home. There's a lot of unhappiness in The Nationals at the moment, and that manifests itself in their absence in this House. Wouldn't you think that, on an issue that has been iconic for them and which they have taken every opportunity to use against their political opponent, they would be in here talking about the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports? They're not because they know that this is a shocking capitulation from their perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is something else they know. They know that, if John Howard had acted, we might never have had that incident in 2011. They also now know that, if they hadn't torn up part of what the Labor government did in the period following 2011, we might never have had an <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span> affair. We never would have seen the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> on our television screensâI can say that with a great deal of confidenceâif (1) Labor had won the 2013 election or (2) they at least hadn't torn up much of the work we had done.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a little bit more history: before we lost office in 2013 I, as agriculture minister, established an interim Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. That was the next phase in our reform program to ensure that we never saw another incident like we saw in Indonesia in 2011. What was the response from our political opponents? The world as we knew it was going to come to an end if we had an Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. We couldn't have that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics is a robust game and people have to be able to give and take, so I am going to take this opportunity to say that it wasn't just the National Party and the Country Liberals over here; the National Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council and the live exporters council also basically said that this would be a terrible thing for the industryâshocking regulation; unneeded. In fact, I still have the letter I received as minister on 16 August, having made my announcement in July 2013. The letter reads: 'I write to formally register the NFF's opposition to the appointment of an inspector-general of animal welfare and live animal exports,' and it goes on to tell us what a terrible thing it would be. I won't bore the House with the rest of the letter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that, since the government capitulated and announced that they were going to embrace an inspector-general, I've heard nothing from the National Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council or anyone else. It's a funny thing. People who represent the agricultural sector, or purport to, should learn that's it's not all about giving, giving, giving; sometimes people have to accept that reform is necessary if we're going to maintain a social licence in some of these industriesâand maintain a social licence we must. Some industries might be past it anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We went into the last election to phase out the live sheep trade. The government's own reports following the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> left us in no doubt, based on the science, that it simply wasn't possible to continue with that trade and, at the same time, meet reasonable animal welfare expectations in the community and amongst our scientists. What did the government do? They said they were standing by our live sheep exporters. But, while they were telling them that they were standing by them, they were regulating them to deathâand the effect is being felt in the live sheep trade tonight, as we speak, and it is an ongoing issue. The government are trying to have it both ways and, in doing so, they do the people they purport to represent no favours whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still a lot of unanswered questions and still a number of reports yet to be responded to, including the heat stress report, which of course lays the foundation to our conclusion that the business model, particularly in the northern summer trade, is fundamentally broken. But, if we'd had an inspector-general of live exports, I don't believe there would have ever been an <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> affair. And, if we hadn't had the member for New England as the minister for a considerable period of timeâI don't recall how long it was; it seemed like a hell of a long timeâwe wouldn't have the culture within the department and the regulator, which sits within the department, that led to so many breaches in the live sheep trade. That's not my conclusion, but the conclusion of Mr Moss, who led one of the three reviews the government was forced to undertake as a result of ongoing issues in the live sheep trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give a little more history. In the 2016 election I announced that, if elected, Labor would implement a six-point animal welfare planâwhich in part was our attempt to get things back on track. What was contained within that six-point plan? I won't go through all the points but it certainly included an inspector-general of live exports and regular ministerial reporting to the parliament, so that people clearly understood how much we'd exported in a given periodâprobably on a quarterly basisâwhether there were any incidents and, if there were any incidents relating to animal welfare issues, what action the government had taken in response to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, those who sit opposite thought this six-point plan was a terrible idea, saying: 'Oh, we couldn't have a six-point plan. That sounds like a shocking regulatory burden. That'd be the end of the industry as we know it. We couldn't have that.' Yet here we are here tonight, the government now embracing the inspector-general after six long years. After six long years, they have come to the conclusion, based on their own recommendations from their own review, that suddenly an inspector-general is a good thing to have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's been at the table praising the idea, telling the world what a wonderful thing it will be, the additional oversight and the transparency it will bring to the live-export sector. I'm really pleased to hear him say that. I do regret that the Minister for Agriculture's not able to be in here saying it, instead, because she is now in the other place. The minister for water, who represents her in this place, oversawâto his creditâthree reviews. It's a shame he's not in this place making the second reading speech. It's more than passing strange, isn't it? In the last parliament this was arguably one of the biggest issues in the agricultural sector, yet Minister Littleproud has given up the opportunity, for some reasonâI'll give him the benefit of the doubt. We don't know what he's doing. There may be something important happeningâ</span>

But I would have thought this was an issue where he would have taken the opportunity to be here, to clarify his position, to explain his backflip and to make a contribution. I will say this about Minister Littleproud: he didn't go all the way, during the most difficult period in which we were debating the live sheep trade, but he did do a fair bit. I suspect that might be why he's no longer the minister for agriculture. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see the member for O'Connor with a smile on his face. I think he knows exactly what I'm talking about. Minister Littleproud didn't stick to the National Party fundamentalism! 'Three reviews? What, you're changing the parameters? You're changing the regulations and you're going to make it harder for the live sheep exporters? We don't do that in the National Party. No, we don't do that. Don't worry about a television program or two. Nothing to be seen here. You don't go out there imposing heavier regulation on the industry. That's not the way we do things in the National Party!' I think that might be why the now minister for water is no longer the Minister for Agriculture. I'm just wondering what the member for O'Connor thinks about that. Yes, I can see he probably agrees with that. I think he knows a little bit more about that than I do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big player in this, and I'll return to it now, has been the member for New England. The recklessness right across the portfolio is writ large in everything he did. I said the night he left the portfolio that it's farewell to the member for New England and now it's time to clean up the mess. And it's a very significant mess he left for us to tidy up. But it's the culture he created within the department that is of real concern, as is highlighted in the Moss report. Shocking. I recommend to anyone to read the Moss report and see how the culture that came from the top made people within the regulator fearful of undertaking their responsibilities in a professional and fearless way. It was made clear to those who worked within the regulator that that was not the will or the wish of the government of the day. And when you create that culture, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> is exactly the outcome you can expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now he doubles down, the member for New England. It wasn't that long ago he was in here accusing the whistleblowers of taking bribes to produce the photographs for those who exposed the problems on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>. Worse than that, he accused them of actually confecting the situation depicted in those photographs. I don't mind people coming in here and using privilege to make allegations. That can be part of our role as members of parliament. We can be whistleblowers ourselves. It's our job to expose things when the rule of law is not being followed, or government policy is not being adhered to, or government policy is not consistent, or someone out there is doing something terrible that we couldn't possibly talk about outside this place without fear of defamation proceedings. But the member for New England does these things without any substantiation whatsoeverâno evidence whatsoever; just that he heard it in the pub. I'm not suggesting he said that, but it is that type of situation. He heard that someone had set this all up and they had taken the photos. They told people to turn the ventilators off and send the photos, and it was all their fault. If I remember correctly, he told us that one of them was now living the high life in Pakistan from the earnings he had secured as a result of this confected incident on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>. Even if you believed it was confected and the photographs had been passed on, I don't think you would be living in a 5-star palace in Pakistan as a result of the payment one might receive for a couple of photographs, but that's what the member for New England told us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He shouldn't come in here and launch allegations like that without being able to substantiate them whatsoever. But I'll give credit to the former minister again. An investigation was held into those allegations, but guess whatâwe don't get to see the report. We are told one thing about what the investigation found, but we don't get to see the report. This is the modus operandi of this government. Everything is secret unless they don't want it to be a secret. When it suits them to have information out there, the information is out there, but, when they don't want to have information out there, you can forget that. You should not expect that information to be shared with us. We shouldn't be surprised, because that is the very foundation of the coalition: the coalition agreement is a secret too.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things we promised in the six-point plan prior to the 2016 election was a review of ESCAS, the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System. It is the foundation of what we put in place after the events of 2011. It is now 2019 and we have been urging and urging that you have to be constantly reviewing these things to ensure that, based on experience, they remain as effective as they were when they were introduced. We also had a review of ASEL, which took the government forever. Everything is on the go-slow with this government. Everything gets put on a committee and kicked down the road. If you keep kicking things down the road, you can expect things to go wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does much of what we did or would have done in 2013. For the interim inspector-general I appointed before the election to have remained in place would have required legislation after the election. We ran out of time to do it before the election and, of course, the member for New England just let it lapse. He said it wasn't needed, it was a waste of money and there was too much regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, finally, we have a bill that does pretty much the same thing. I remind those with an interest in this that the inspector-general does not impose any additional regulation on live exporters. The inspector-general oversees the regulator. If you like, he or she is the auditor of the regulator. He or she makes sure that, if something goes wrong, things are properly looked at and the regulator takes appropriate action. That is a simplification, but it is an important part of the role. That doesn't impose any burden whatsoever on live exporters. Theoretically, he or she can do that without even talking to a live exporter. But it certainly doesn't impose a regulatory burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the fact that, like our own inspector-general back in 2013, the inspector-general will have a work program. I have it in front of me. It's a significant work program, talking about three-year reviews, monitoring and reporting during livestock export voyages, livestock export licensing and permits, reviewing ESCAS, reviewing ASEL and just generally making sure over time that things are properly running within the regulator. That's a very sensible proposition, and we welcome the fact that the government will now do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members will note that in 2013 a Labor government announced the appointment of an interim Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. This bill creates an Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports. There's something missing. It's animal welfare. The government just can't bring themselves to talk about animal welfare, because it's not consistent with the National Party's fundamentalism. You don't talk about animal welfare, even though out there in the marketplace people are increasingly concerned about animal welfare. The best way to ensure that the industry maintains a social licence is to talk about animal welfare and to transparently demonstrate that we have a plan together, working with industry, to ensure the highest standards of animal welfare. While the government's accepted a few amendments to strengthen the bill, and I appreciate that, it's still a little bit lighter on the animal welfare side than was our inspector-general bill back in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we won't haggle over details. The key thing is that we now will haveâand do have, in factâan Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports. That's good news for the industry itself, because it allows the industry to say, 'We are overseen now by a regulator but, in addition to that, the regulator is overseen by an inspector-general who is constantly working on plans to ensure the regulator has the right model, a model which ensures that animal welfare is respected and animal welfare standards are consistent with what ordinary Australians would expect of both the model and the regulator.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It shouldn't have come to this. We shouldn't have had to wait six years. At the risk of repeating myself, there were a number of incidents over the last six years we probably wouldn't have had and didn't need to have. If we had not had them, the export industry would be in much better shape. You know you are going to getâI'm happy to use the word; it's one I'm going to apply certainly not to all exporters, or even the majority, but only to a few exportersâcowboys in any industry when you have a minister who has sent a very clear message both to his department and to the broader community, and to the exporters themselves, that they can be pretty certain that, when something pops up, the response will be, 'Nothing to see here.' The then members for Warringah and Wentworth followed the member for New England blindly when he thought that he was helping the live exporters. Can you imagine him pre election? 'Don't worry. When we get elected, you won't have to worry about all that stuff the Labor Party goes on aboutâregulation. We don't need that. It's all rubbish. We know you blokes do a good job. You're important to the Australian economy. You'll be all right under us.' Well, they weren't all right under him, and they still aren't all right.</span>

Let's hope that the live cattle trade can get on with its life. But the government needs to be honest about the live sheep trade. The live sheep trade has a broken business model, and I think the government has to have a long think about that. Obviously, Minister Littleproud needs to have a long think about it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we made a commitment that we would phase the trade out over five years, we also made a commitment that we would support our farmers and sheepmeat producers and others along the supply chain to ensure that they had a path to a transition to something betterâmost obviously, more value-adding here in Australia, developing and growing more jobs here in Australia. By contrast, when this government regulated the industry to death while at the same time claiming it supported it, it did not lift one finger to help sheepmeat producers who have been impacted by their decisions. It has not lifted one finger and has not spent one cent to support any sheepmeat producer who has been hurt economically by the suspension of the trade. Remember that we got into trouble for suspending the trade for four or five weeks. This time trade has been suspended for months, and the government has done nothing.</span>

They have not had the government reach out to them at any time and say: 'We know that these additional regulations and restrictions must be hurting you, what can we do to help you? Is it financial support or is it a model that helps you make the transition?' There has been nothing. I say to the farm leadership groups: the next time everything this mob do is right and everything we do is wrong, you might want to reflect on some of the things that have occurred not just over the last six years but since 2011.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I rise to support the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Bill 2019. I've had extensive discussions with the minister. The intent of this bill is to provide the industry with an independent umpire, someone who can be the go-between for the regulator, the department, the commercial side of the industry and the animal welfare groups that follow the industry very closely. I think the intent is very worthy. I thoroughly support the minister's intent there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By coincidence, in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> there is a story by Jenne Brammer. The headline is 'Live exports vital to WA economy and farms'. The report talks about an average of 1.5 million sheep being exported out of Western Australia annually over the last five years, with a total value of around $200 million. About 45 per cent of that value, or around $100 million, is retained on farms. I have to say that the majority of those farms fall in my electorate of O'Connor. This issue has been very important to me and the people who live in my electorate. This legislation, which brings in an inspector-general to be, as I said, an independent umpire, is critical for the people in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hunterâit's a shame; it looks like he's leavingâhad a bit more of a spring in his step last time he tried to shut the industry down, back in I think late November or early December last year. We all remember those heady days, don't we, Member for Hunter? We were all getting thousands of emails telling us that this was a vote-changing issue. They were automatically generated by Animals Australia. They bombarded our inboxes and said: 'How can you sleep at night? This is a vote-changing issue.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, in the election on 18 May, votes did change. Let's have a quick look at the member for Hunter's results in the election on 18 May. I see that his primary vote fell 14.22 per cent and the two-party-preferred vote fell 9.8. I see the member for Brand, whose electorate encompasses many of the people who work in the live export trade. Her two-party-preferred vote fell 4.8 per cent and her primary vote fell 7.1. So it definitely moved votes. There's no question about that at all, I think. But, unfortunately for the member for Hunter and others, the votes and the quiet Australians actually supported what many Western Australians see as a critical industry for our state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it's a shame the member for Hunter is leaving, because I've got plenty more to say, particularly about the allegations that he raised and mentioned that the member for New England had discussed. I've discussed those allegations outside of this place. I'm not relying on privilege. Anybody who wants to see me in court is more than welcome to do so. I'm more than happy to have the information that I have here tested in court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first lot of information, which I received around December last year, goes to the turmoil that the industry has been thrown into since the <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> report was aired in April last year. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> voyage, as we all know, took place in August 2017. An extraordinary heat event combined with some geopolitical issues meant that we saw a very, very distressing outcome in terms of mortalities on that voyage. The department, the regulator, investigated that voyage and released mortality report No. 69, which was released in March 2018, which, while it had some concerns, effectively said that the issue had been unavoidable, and that was the end of the matter. But, of course, <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> aired some very distressing video footage in early April 2018, and the industry has been in serious turmoil ever since. The cost of that turmoil on the farmers within my electorate has been estimated at around $100 million. That's a significant amount of money that this series of events has cost the farmers in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go to the comments that the member for Hunter made about the allegations that this video footage was perhaps contrived, or perhaps framed, to certainly look as bad as it possibly could for the industry. Last December I received some bank statements that relate to the bank accounts of a Mr Fazal Ullah. Mr Ullah was the whistleblower who supplied the video footage to Animals Australia, who then subsequently shopped it around and had <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> pick it up. This series of bank statements shows that around A$178,000 was deposited into Mr Ullah's account. The interesting thing about these bank statements is that the money wasn't paid necessarily after the August <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> event. The first payment, on 26 June 2017 of $5,850, was well before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> eventâwell before that event. Several more payments took place before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> voyage. That's the first thing to note. Since then some very diligent journalists who have been working on this case have provided me with some emails from a deckhand who worked on the boat, Mr Mahmood Raza Mazher. Mr Mazher signed a statutory declaration. It was witnessed at the High Commission in Singapore, so I give enormous credibility to the statement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the emails that I have here in my possession are from a Ms Lyn White, who is a well-known, high-profile operator at Animals Australia. This particular email is part of a chain of emails. Ms White says, 'I believe I can send another $1,000 donation at this stage to thank you for establishing the next opportunity, and I will await your advice as to who to send this money to.' There is no question that Animals Australia were forwarding money to potential whistleblowers. Ms White goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The key to achieving the next steps towards ending the trade, will be showing that suffering still is occurring. Injured and sick sheep not being found/treatedâpens still overcrowdedâanimals suffering heat stress (panting). Piles of dead etc.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What you need to understand here is that the deckhands that this email is addressed to are responsible for looking after those very sick and injured sheep. If there are sick and injured sheep in the pens that they are filming and that aren't being treated, that's because they haven't taken them out. At the end of the decks on the boatsâthere are about eight decksâis a hospital pen and an Australian accredited vet on every voyage, whose job is to treat and look after the sheep. His job is not to go through each individual pen and find the sick and injured sheep; that is the job of the deckhand. If the deckhand is being paid, enticed and encouraged, as per this email, not to take those sheep out of the pen, not to put them in the hospital pen for the Australian accredited vet to treat, then that is a prima facie case of animal cruelty, encouraged by Animals Australiaâthank you very much!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, going on through this statutory declaration, Mr Mazher says in section 31: 'Part of Fazal's responsibility would have also been to identify animals which were diseased, distressed, and to remove them from the pen. In my experience there are always smaller or weaker sheep that need attention and additional care.' That's from the second deckhand, talking about Mr Ullah. He also goes on to say: 'The video of the sheep panting was extremely shocking to me. I have never observed sheep panting in that way before. The sheep look exhausted and choking due to lack of air supply.' Importantly, he goes on to say: 'Every deck cadet is trained to operate the vessel's ventilation system. The ventilation system cannot be shut down without the officers on the bridge or other parts of the vessel becoming aware. The ventilation system can be reduced to zero from the sundeck switchbox room without anybody noticing, however.' So it is entirely possible, according to Mr Mazher, a deckhand on the ship as well, that Mr Ullah could have manipulated, without anybody knowing, the ventilation system to get the sort of footage that Ms White and Animals Australia were offering enormous amounts of money for. These deckhands get paid around US$6,000 per annum. $178,000 is roughly equivalent to 25 years salary, which they were being offered to come up with the footage that Ms White has described here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at where the industry's at now. We've had ships that were suspended or stopped due to licence issues between May 2018 and November. But, thankfully, on 12 November last year we saw the first boats start up again. We saw 11 voyages that took place over the summer period, just under a million sheep for, I think, something like 1,800 mortalities. The last voyage, which left Fremantle on 28 May and arrived in the Middle East on 12 June, had 68 mortalities across, I think, around 56,000 sheep. That's a mortality rate of 0.16. Any farmer running sheep in a paddock situation would be very happy with those sorts of results. We're never happy to see sheep dieâthough they do, for all sorts of reasonsâbut most farmers would be pretty happy with that level of mortality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going forward, I think the industry does have a strong foundation. We have proven that we can conduct these voyages humanely and with very good results. The member for Hunter mentioned the heat stress review. The original recommendation was a 28 degree wet bulb limit. That was based on some laboratory experiments with eight sheep in an experimental situation. What we have seen from the data on the voyageâfrom the independent observers and the Australian accredited vetsâis that even at wet bulb temperatures of up to 32 degrees the sheep are not showing any undue distress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, I'm very proud of the fact that we have worked with the industry, stuck by the industry and made the necessary regulatory changes to make sure that the industry can continue sustainably. We need the exporters to be able to continue to buy our sheep out of Western Australia. It's a particular type of sheep, mainly lightweight merino wethers, which the processors are not really interested in. We need the exporters to be able to continue to pay a sustainable price for those sheep. We need to honour those Middle Eastern markets that value our product and have invested a lot of money in the supply chain and the infrastructure to ship our sheep. We need to balance that, of course, with welfare outcomes. But good welfare outcomes don't necessarily happen when we have animal welfare organisations inducing very low-paid deckhands to provide footage of animals suffering so that they can further their agenda to close the trade down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports. I see the role of the inspector-general as being not only to oversee the regulation of the industry and make sure that it's done appropriately and properly, and not only to liaise with the industry and make sure that they are doing the right thing, but also to ensure that these radical animal activist groups are held to account for the sorts of activities that they've been getting up to over many years and continue to get up to to this day. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

Today I feel a bit like Marty McFly standing here, because this really is a back-to-the-future moment. This government is resurrecting the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports as an independent statutory office holder, reporting to the Minister for Agriculture. Labor did this back in 2013. Let's fire up the DeLorean, strap in and have a look at the history of the inspector-general legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 July 2013 the then agriculture minister, the member for Hunter, announced that Labor would establish an Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. The position was to build on Australia's best regulatory framework for the export of livestock for slaughter. Labor understood that, while the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System significantly improved conditions by which animals were exported and how they were slaughtered, there needed to be a level of independent oversight for the regulator to maintain public confidence in the trade. The inspector-general would have added another layer of assurance that our regulatory system was delivering the animal welfare outcomes, through auditing and reviewing the investigative and compliance processes. There would have been no additional burden of red tape on exporters or trading partners through the development of this role. In the interim phase this system was working well, and the industry, despite concerns that were put to the then minister, was doing what it does best: supplying well farmed sheep to the world. The inspector-general gave Australians confidence that appropriate animal welfare outcomes were being metâor at least there was an effort to meet them. Labor has never been about shutting down the meat industry in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't like live export of sheep. We went to the election saying that we would end the northern summer tradeâabsolutely. The evidence is overwhelming. The northern summer trade of live export of sheep just can't be met. You can't put in place the animal welfare standards that are required and still have a profitable trade while meeting all the consumer expectations. We don't think it can be done. But the cost of making sure that the industry kept its credibility with an inspector-general was $4 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But fast-forward four months to a new government, after 2013, and the wisdom of the new minister, the member for New England: he closed the program down. He claimed that the current regulation of livestock exports is designed to minimise risk, and that's why he was confident that the establishment of an inspector-general of animal welfare was not necessary. He said that the inspector-general was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ a classic example of layer upon layer of bureaucracy without any practical outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said that the livestock export regulator was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ already, and remains, subject to appropriate oversight and review mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said that this was 'one bit of red tape we can do without'. These are all the words of the member for New England, who was then the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how did this sage-like wisdom end up? What happened after that? Well, <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> exposed animal welfare failings in the live sheep export trade relating to voyages to the Middle East during the northern summer. I know that the member for O'Connor has just been on his feet, making all sorts of allegationsâwhich I would be very interested to hear him make outside the protection of this chamber. They were allegations of a criminal nature about the people involved.</span>

                    </a>  He willâI'll take that interjection. He will, the member for Barker says. There were unacceptable rates of mortality on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>in August 2017, exposed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> program, with the Australian community quite rightly voicing its concerns about the welfare of sheep. The phones in electorate offices around the country went bananas, and there was email after email. I know that the allegation on that side of the House is that somehow this was an electronically orchestrated campaign and that these people's concerns should not be taken seriously. Well, attached to these emails were names of real people in the electorate. I, like many other MPs, contacted these people, and they expressed their concerns. They said, 'Yes, I'm concerned about this issue.' We expect better treatment of Australian animals, raised in Australia under Australian conditions. We expect better treatment at the end of life, and we expect better treatment on that journey. Customers want the assurance. We're not talking here about everybody going vegan. I like my lamb roast and lamb shoulders as much as anybody does. But we expect there to be a good chain of quality assurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, following that program and following the concerns raised, the government went through all its changes. The member for New England was no longer the Minister for Agriculture, no longer the Deputy Prime Minister. The new fellow came in, the member for Maranoa, as the new minister, and he commissioned the McCarthy review and the Moss review. Mr Philip Moss AM conducted an independent review of the regulatory capabilityâand culture, importantlyâof the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in the regulation of live animal exports. The Moss review recommended, among other things, that an independent external entity, known as an inspector-general, be established to introduce an additional layer of accountability for the regulator. So, we're back to square one; we're back to where we were in 2013âall that wasted time, all that wasted effort, getting rid of an inspector-general for animal welfare, and it never needed to happen. If we'd kept an inspector-general all this time, throughout the six dead years of this government, there would be many thousands of beasts destined for export with better quality assurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision by the member for New England, endorsed by the coalition government, to abolish the inspector-general of live exports in 2013 led to a collapse in public confidence in the live export sector, which hurts producers; it hurts the people in the electorate of the member for O'Connor. It was a monumental failure, a ridiculous, reckless, idiotic decision to abolish the inspector-general of animal welfare. I am pleased the member for Maranoa, the then minister, saw sense and saw fit to bring this position back in. As the member for Hunter said, he is no longer the Minister for Agricultureâand we can all speculate as to why, as to whether he's gone off script in what he's trying to achieve. The fact is, it did take that <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> program, revealing animal welfare failings, for the government to act. That's what it took for the government to act, to ensure that the live export regulator considers animal welfare when issuing export permits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes the rebirth of the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports. It will add another layer of independent oversight. The true test will be for the new agriculture minister, Senator McKenzie, to ensure that the failings identified in the Moss review are addressed. The member for New England certainly did not understand the importance of animal welfare, not just to consumers but to producers. The more confidence consumers have in animal welfare the better off producers are and the better off the agriculture sector is. Treating animals better in the processing chain is good business practice. It's just good for business. So we thank Mr Philip Moss AM for his <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the regulatory capability and culture of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in the regulation of live animal exports</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I echo the sentiments of the member for Hunter. There is a culture issue in the department, perhaps led by the nose by the member for New England. A culture has seeped through that department that anything goes, where too many blind eyes are being turned to animal welfare. Hopefully this new position will help correct that. We need a culture change in the department that takes animal welfare more seriously in the supply chain. Mr Moss identified shortcomings in the way the department organises itself as a regulator and undertakes its regulatory functions. It's not just an industry booster. It shouldn't be there just to say anything goes. It is a regulator. The department has a role in making sure things are done properly and lawfully. These are the same shortcomings that Labor identified back in 2013âin the DeLorean!âand we introduced the role of the inspector-general as a way to combat it, only to see the new government axe it four months later. It's just a circle repeating itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still more work to be done and the recommendations need to be implemented. There are 31 recommendations in these reviews, and not just 10 or 20 but all 31 recommendations need to be implemented. I do hope this will get our sheepmeat industry back on track and give the public the confidence it should always have in the way we do business in Australia and in the agricultural sector when dealing with our livestock. Sheepmeat is an important industry. I'll make no bones about it. Labor went to the election saying that we would phase out live sheep export over a five-year period, if my memory serves me correctly, and we would cease the northern summer trade immediately if we won the election. We didn't win the election. We do accept that. But the fact is that consumers demand better quality assurance and standards of humane treatment of animals throughout the process. They want to ensure that the meat they are eating has a quality chain all the way to slaughter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll touch very briefly on the member for O'Connor. I think he was having a bit of a crack at the member for Hunter and the election result. I'll put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>that the member for O'Connor's 2PP at the election went down 0.56 per cent. Maybe he doesn't think much of that, 64 per cent of the 2PP, but it did go down. His primary vote went down 0.63 per cent. And he's there giving lectures to us. He can't take any comfort out of that. People need to remember that we did lose the election. We know that, and we're going through a review process, which is well known. But there was shocking hubris and arrogance on that side of the chamber.</span>

Labor support the bill, but we're sorry that we had to be here at all to debate this, because the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports should have already been in place for the last six years.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  In rising to speak on the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Bill 2019, I want to say what a great privilege it is to speak after the member for Lyons as he lectures us about hubris and those sorts of things. I do wonder whether he was an invited guest at the ALP celebration of their '2019 election victory' that preceded the actual count on election day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I must say that I was impressed by his reference to the DeLorean and<span style="font-style:italic;"> Back </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">o </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Future</span>. I noticed that he dialled up the DeLorean to 2013. I wonder if he could dial it a bit deeper into timeâspecifically to 7 June 2011. The member for Hindmarsh, who was then the member for Port Adelaide, would remember this date because his then colleague, former Minister Ludwig, signed an order that evening banning the live cattle trade to Indonesia. So, when the member for Lyons comes into this place and says, 'We're not against live exports,' and then quickly corrects himself and says, 'But, at the last election, we effectively took the position that we're against the live export of sheep,' he should remember that. So, instead of talking about the DeLorean, I have a different analogy for him. It's a <span style="font-style:italic;">Men </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n Black</span> analogyâbecause it seems that, when you arrive in the Labor caucus, you're asked to stare into the light and forget it all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also talked about how they have accepted the loss. Hallelujahâit's been four months! But, while he says that they have accepted the loss, I'm not convinced that they have accepted that the people of Australia got it right. I'm not sure they have accepted that. Until they have accepted that, they will continue in this maelstrom that they find themselves in, kind of working out what they stand for and whether it is consistent with contemporary Australian values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the live export trade. This trade amounts to about $250 million for the Australian economy. Obviously all of this is generated out of regional Australia, with the overwhelming portion coming from the member for O'Connor's electorate. I must say that I haven't found a stronger advocate for their people on a difficult issue like this than the member for O'Connor. He has been there for his producers. Can I be absolutely plain about this and get right back to fundamentals. Nobody, and I mean nobody, condones cruelty to animalsânot me, not the member for O'Connor and not the thousands of sheepmeat producers in my electorate, who, by the way, spend a small fortune, much more than I imagine anyone in this place, on animal husbandry. Why do they do that? Because to this extent the member for Lyons is right: a healthy animal is a profitable animal. Then again, an animal that you cannot export to particular markets is nowhere near as profitable. It is critical that we understand that this debate is not about whether one side of politics accepts cruelty to animals and the other doesn't. No-one does. This is about getting the balance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fundamental is that if Australian exporters are not in these markets, these markets won't transition to vegan based products. They will get their sheepmeat or equivalent from other jurisdictions. Those jurisdictions don't have contemporary Australian standards when it comes to animal husbandry. In standards around animal export, we lead the world. If you are passionate about animal welfare, as I am, it is critical that Australia stays in these markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am equally passionate about the welfare of farmers. You don't have to turn your mind back too much, Member for Lyons. You get in the DeLorean and wind it all the way back to the after-effects of June 2011, when peopleâin particular, northern cattlemenâtook their lives as a consequence of the decision that was taken in this place as a kneejerk reaction to footage, which I acknowledge was clearly inappropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a lot more to this story. There is a lot more to be told, and there will be opportunities to tell it. Like the member for O'Connor, I have been privileged to see certain information that will see the light of day. What concerns me is that, for those around this debate who, like me, are motivated by the need to ensure that animals are not harmed, this information will shock the Australian consciousness. I have lost confidence in the footage. I am not ignorant. I understand what I saw in that footage. But, owing to what I have seen, I have now lost confidence in how that footage came to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lobbyists in this space who want to see this trade closed down. I am not suggesting those opposite are in this category. While they have a stated position that they want to see the end of this trade, I am being clear not to suggest that what I am about to say relates to them. It relates to activists in this space, who, I respectfully suggest, will go to any means to damage the confidence the Australian people have in live animal exports. It is to be determined whether the footage that has been broadcast far and wide was a product of genuine whistleblowing or was orchestrated so as to provide a sense that these animals were in harm's way. I am not naive enough to suggest that this is not a significant assertion, but there is a reasonable basis for making it. If any of this is made out, those actors who have put in jeopardy the livelihoods of thousands of Australian farmersâhardworking men and womenâwill need to account for their behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill because it's effectively an integrity measure. Like others in this place, I'm proud of Australia's record in animal husbandry and I'm proud of our record in the live export of animals, be they sheep, beef, goat or others. We lead the world. In recent times we have seen an incredible decline in mortality rates, and, by any measure, that represents success. These matters will no doubt be litigated in coming months, if not years. I congratulate members of the fourth estateâSharri Markson and othersâwho have spoken directly to deckhands and others on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span> and other voyages so as to effectively blow the whistle on the whistleblowers. I'm very disturbed to hear in this place the member for Lyons, in his speech, being critical of the department and effectively suggesting that the department had an attitude of turning a blind eye. I'm going to unpack that, Member for Lyons, because you cannot make that strong assertionâ</span>

You effectively alleged in this place, the people's house, that people working inside the department have a laissez-faire attitude and have effectively turned a blind eye to animal cruelty.

I'll tell him something that he might not historically know. At the 2016 election the member for O'Connor led all comers when it came to the increase in his two PP. If that's a measure of success, he was atop the dais with a gold medal. On the other hand, the member for Lyons comes here and acknowledges that the Labor Party lost the election. Do you know what else they lost? Two seats in Tasmania. It should've been three. The member for Lyons knows that it should have been three. The member for Lyons knows it and the people of Tasmania know it. </span>

We've got only one in 2022, Member for Lyons. We're going to remind the sheepmeat producers in your electorate that you stood up in this place, you acknowledged that you lost the election, you weren't prepared to acknowledge that the people of Australia got it right and you worked hard every day in this place to undermine the live sheep trade. Between now and 2022 we're going to remind them day in and day out. I hope you've got your CV in order.</span>

In the great filing cabinet of Commonwealth law, the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Bill 2019 goes into the drawer marked 'stupid mistakes with terrible consequences'. This bill recreates an Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports. Why? To provide oversight of the live export industry. When did the government figure out that that was such a brilliant idea? How many animal welfare atrocities did it take and how much evidence did they need of awful conduct and hopeless regulation of this industry, especially in the export of live sheep?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As everyone in the debate so far has acknowledged, six years ago, in 2013, the then Labor government created an interim inspector-general of animal welfare and an Australian Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, and the newly elected coalition government decided to get rid of both of those things. It was an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. It is hard to understand how they made that decision. The only way you can partly understand it, I think, is to note that the responsible minister at the time was the member for New England. The responsible minister at the time, the member for New England, in explaining why the interim inspector-general of animal welfare had to go, said it had been introduced only so that:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ people would feel a sense of solace in the urban areas, cause they'll say "oh well that sounds great". But when you peel back the onion you say well, you're really just putting a policeman on a policeman. The first policeman will do the job very well. Let the first policeman do the job. You don't need to have policemen on policemen, otherwise it becomes a ludicrous extension. Why don't we get an auditor for the auditor just in case the auditor's not doing his job? And then we'll get an auditor for that auditor so the auditor's auditor not doing its job and we can have - and it goes on like Kafka forever.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose was to oversight the regulation of the live export industry. The mistake the government made was about as obvious as they come, and that has been clear every day for the past six years, and it was made crystal clear by the review undertaken by Mr Philip Moss after we'd seen atrocity on atrocity in relation to the live sheep export trade. The review by Mr Philip Moss, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Regulatory capability and culture of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in the regulation of live animal exports</span>âwhich the member for Barker should take some time to read at some pointâidentified a series of ways in which getting rid of the inspector-general of animal welfare was a profoundly stupid thing to do. We've known for a long time that live export is inherently dangerous for animals, that it's likely to produce animal suffering and that when you transport sheep in decrepit old ships for weeks on end to the hottest part of the world at the hottest time of the year then animal suffering is guaranteed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the heat stress review, which has not been made public, that our previous approachâwhich was to measure suffering only through the death rate of animalsâwas wrong. Sheep are hardy animals. I've had sheep farmers from around Australia get in contact with me on this issue, and that's a point that they often make: lots of sheep have made it to the Middle East having been put through pain and suffering that vets and the Australian public rightly find absolutely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that there's an inherent conflict in the department that is responsible for promoting agriculture and related trade and also responsible for animal welfare. Those two things do not always pull in the same direction. There are aspects of primary production and trade that work against the humane treatment of animals. That much is obvious. That's where the member for New England and so many of his colleagues have gone badly wrong. It's not a case of having an auditor for an auditor; it's a case of having an independent person who's charged with a pure focus on animal welfare being responsible for overseeing a bureaucracy that has conflicting imperatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the regulatory approach itself was structurally flawed. Vets accredited by the government to be responsible for animal welfare were employed by the live exporters. It doesn't take a genius to realise that people in that circumstance are going to be compromised. The Moss review noted:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Although on-board AAVs are accredited by and report to the department they are employed by the exporter. This role appears to be inherently conflicted â¦</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so it was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there were cultural problems in the department. That seems to offend the member for Barker. We know there were cultural problems in the department and there'd been a loss of animal welfare expertise. That was led by this government. That culture problem and that irresponsibility started with this government. It started with the then minister, the member for New England, and it was enabled by everybody else around him. The Moss review said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently there is a lack of focus on and expertise in animal welfare.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The department does not have a single regulatory mindset.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we know that the approach of the department, and of the industry in general, to the contribution of animal welfare organisations was massively unhelpful. This is the quote from the Moss review that the members for O'Connor and Barker should pay some close attention to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Animal welfare organisations play a significant role in the regulatory framework because, through the resourcing they dedicate to monitoring, they are a significant source of information about animal health and welfare in the context of live animal exports. Consistent with good regulatory practice, the department needs to improve its connection with this sector. The re-establishment of an animal welfare branch in the department would help to address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had the member for Barker come in. At some points in his speech I felt like I'd fallen asleep and woken up in a lecture about the assassination of JFK or the moon landing, as if these things are all part of a pattern of fakery and the footage that we saw of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> had somehow been made up, it never really happened and the live export of sheep is actually perfectly okay. Don't forget that there have been more than 100 voyages in which more than 1,000 sheep have died. There has been incident after incident after incident. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> is only the most recent. But we still have members of the government not prepared to address the cultural problem in the government and blaming animal welfare organisations. 'There's nothing wrong with the trade. It's the animal welfare organisations that have somehow concocted video footage of animals literally dying by drowning in their own waste.' That is ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is an obvious mistake, a stupid mistake, with terrible consequences. What consequences? We know that the ships being operated were unfit for transport. The department has belatedly admitted to that. We know there were falsified vet reports, an outcome directly affected by the fact that authorised vets were employed by the exporters. We know there was chronic departmental inaction in the face of clear breaches of regulation and clear instances of animal welfare abuse. We know there was enormous and relentless suffering inflicted on animals. In 2014, 4,000 sheep died on a trip from Fremantle to Qatar. In 2016, 3,000 sheep died on another Emanuel Exports voyage. Then, in 2017, there was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>, with 2,500 sheep dying. Since the live sheep export trade began, terrible, decrepit converted car carriers have been taking tens of thousands of sheep at the hottest time of the year to the hottest part of the world in awful, unregulated conditions. Two hundred million sheep have gone from Australia to the Middle East. Three million have died, and let's not make the mistake of assuming that only the three million that died suffered, because there would be millions and millions of sheep that got off at the other end barely alive, having gone through an experience that the Australian public rightly finds utterly unacceptable. There is no sliding scale on which the suffering of animals becomes acceptable at some price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that, apart from the animal suffering that has occurred through this industry, enabled by this government, people have been harmed as well. Farmers have been harmed. Farming communities have been harmed, as have other people involved in the production chain. That is an important part of the story. They are people in my home state of Western Australia, and I have sympathy for those on the land who had every right to expect a regulatory system that would keep the export industry to high and rigorous standards. That didn't happen. Exporters pulled the wool over their eyes and over the eyes of the regulators, but the regulators weren't looking hard enough. That's something that people involved in the industryâthe farmers, feed producers and truck driversâand the communities in which they live need to be clear eyed about. I speak to representatives of primary producers. I speak to the peak bodies. I speak to truck drivers and their representatives. I speak to individual farmers. When I do that, I tell them straight, 'You've been let down by your representative groups and by some of your representatives in this place, because they ignored the clear signs of a rotten industry.' They ignored them and they lied to the people that they were supposed to be representing, their constituentsâwhether they're representatives in this place or whether they're peak bodies. They cheered on this government when it took away those regulatory protections. They didn't say, 'Hang on a second, those regulatory protections are important to us. They're part of our social licence. We care about our animals. We want our industry to be'âwhat is it they say these days?</span>

Not enough people said that, not enough farmers said that, not enough truck drivers said that and none of the peak bodies said that.

Some of them have been too quick to say, exactly as the member for O'Connor and the member for Barker said, 'There's nothing wrong with this industry.

There's nothing hard and there's nothing courageous about standing up and telling people what they want to hear. There are some people who've been involved in this trade for a long time who should have a bit more courage and should be prepared to say to people involved in this trade, 'We've let you down. It's been a rotten trade and we've enabled it,' because that is the truth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in the broader community have been very clear. They've spoken up and they've said, 'This is wrong and has got to stop.' They're not just people in cities. They're not just beard wearing, cold-coffee-brew drinking, inner city hipsters; they are all over this country. I've been contacted by people outside Western Australia, which is principally the only place where the live sheep trade happens, who have said, 'This has to stop.' I've been contacted by plenty of farmers, and certainly plenty of sheep farmers, who have said, 'I would never subject my animals to that kind of treatment. This has to stop. They are bringing us all down. They are bringing down responsible agricultural producers.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in that spaceâsome of the people who are involved and benefit from itâenabled the harm. The harm is not created by animal activists. It wasn't created by the Labor Party or any members in this place who spoke up in the absolutely rightful cause of proper regulation. It was created by the industry, by the exporters in particular, and by people on that sideâby the governmentâwho stupidly and wantonly took away protection that should always have been maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, where are we now? Belatedly, half-heartedly and six years on, the government have been dragged to put back something that was there six years ago. We know that the cessation of the trade does not bring ruin to the farming sector in Western Australia. It has had impacts and that's difficult. I feel for the people who've been on the receiving end, but we had two summers when the trade dropped away. The suggestion by some that it would lead to some kind of widespread ruin in Western Australia has not proved to be true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The live sheep trade continues to decline. It is terminal. The export of boxed meat and chilled carcasses to the Middle East continues to grow. That's our future. That's the future of the trade. It's a future with higher value-added exports, more jobs in Australia and, most of all, better animal welfare outcomes. We have the prospect of moving out of the live sheep trade altogether. We know it's possible. We know it's necessary. It's going to take leadership and courage. We've shown that. It's about time some people on that side stood up and did that as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  I speak to the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Bill 2019, denying the amendment. The bill builds on success in, if you like, cleaning up the live sheep trade in particular and the live export trade generally. The government has, since 2013, in the wake of the 2011 suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia, sought to rebuild the trust of the Australian public in this trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested in the comments of the member for Fremantleâas he leaves the chamberâwhere he said that sometimes we make stupid mistakes with terrible consequences. I thought he was referring to the shutdown of the live cattle export industry in 2011, because that was terrible. That was terrible. There were terrible consequences, terrible human consequences. We had cattlemen in the Northern Territory beside themselves. I don't want to draw the link that I could, but let me say that people were under terrible mental stress. We saw them down here in Canberra. They came down to speak to us. Their industry was decimated overnight, in the true sense of the termâone-tenth of it was washed away. I will say some more about that event a little later, but it was a stupid mistake with terrible consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 we set about rebuilding trust in the industry and we established ESCAS, the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System, which is aimed at making sure that the places that receive our live animals treat them in the same manner that they would be treated if they entered the slaughter lines in Australia. This demand by Australiaâthat if you want to get Australian livestock you have to meet these standardsâhas had a knock-on effect for all animals that are slaughtered pretty much all over the world, certainly in the markets that import Australian livestock, because, as facilities are upgraded, local stock are treated in the same manner. Those of us in the industry know that if you treat animals correctly, if you keep stress levels down, you'll actually end up with a better product at the end of the chain. So, if countries and recipients of Australian animals don't do the right thing, they don't get the livestock. They have to shut down until they can comply with the ESCAS. So that's been a really good development, and it has made a lot of changes. We've seen a lot of investment in our markets where better slaughter facilities have been put in place. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some very disturbing footage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> 2017 voyage was aired in 2018. I note the comments of the member for Barker, who has thrown some doubt on these images. I guess that's a game that has to be played out. He says he has informationâand perhaps the member for O'Connor also has informationâthat he believes is a smoking gun. Whether or not those accusations, if you like, will be proved, we will know in time. But I just note that he, at least, has made those comments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're moving to bring in new requirements for shipping, by, firstly, increasing the space that live sheep will enjoy when they are on the transport vessels, and we have eliminated shipping in the northern summer. This has led, at least anecdotally from the advice I'm getting, to better results than we were achieving even before that time. On the mortality rate, I note that, for the year to date, it is 0.61 per cent, which is the lowest in a decade and which would indicate we are making further ground. I know there are some figures that will imminently be tabled by the ministerâperhaps in the other place, given that's where the minister sitsâand I'm pretty confident, or I'm hopeful, that those figures will be lower again. I was with a pastoralist today, who was here in Canberra on other issues. He's a friend of mine. He has 130,000 sheep, and when he heard the figure of 0.61 per cent he said, 'That's pretty much like they are in the paddock.' We teased that out a little bit more and he said, 'No, perhaps it's a bit higher if they're in the paddock.' But it probably aligns pretty accurately with an intense livestock handling period such as you might get at shearing time. So, if we can get those kinds of results on a vessel, as opposed to other times, I think we are making real ground in this space. As I said, I believe we will continue to improve on those particular outcomes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Australian manufacturers of vitamins and mineral supplements have had to remove the iconic 'Australian Made' logo from their products due to the government's incompetence and inaction. It's been a year since federal Labor called on the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology to act and stop an industry worth $5 billion to the Australian economy from being forced offshore, putting close to 30,000 jobs at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementary Medicines Australia have advised that this issue has so far affected 200 'Australian Made' licensees, and that any further delays will risk future investment. Many of these companies have made significant investments in manufacturing in this country, including Sanofi's $40 million investment recently in their Brisbane manufacturing facility. Household names like Blackmores, Swisse, Nature's Own and Cenovis are all affected by the dithering and delay of this do-nothing government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In submissions to the Complementary Medicine Taskforce, one local manufacturer described clarity around the country-of-origin labelling requirements as being 'critical' to their businesses. Another has said that the potential loss of the 'Made in Australia' claim will have a 'direct and undermining effect' on their marketing campaign in China, while a third has said that they would think twice about introducing new products if they were not able to claim that they are made in Australia. This is one of the few manufacturing industries in Australia that isn't in decline under this government, and by dragging their feet on this the government are putting the whole sector in jeopardy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's change to 'Made in Australia' labelling and interpretations of the legislation has now seen local vitamins and mineral supplement manufacturers stripped of their ability to use the labels as of 30 June this year. This means 'Australian Made' labelling is not available for some products made in Australia by Australian workers. This is despite Minister Karen Andrews' promise on 5 April this year to heed Labor's concerns and make regulatory changes to protect these manufacturers. Indeed, the minister stated the industry 'should be assured that I'm doing all that I can to assist'. Well, it has been 166 days since this promise and, still, nothing has happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By doing nothing, the government is hurting Australian manufacturers. The government is hurting workers and threatening their jobs and hurting consumers too. The government is putting close to 30,000 jobs at risk in this billion-dollar industry. For every week that this drags on, we are missing out on millions of dollars of export revenue, due to the inaction. So what I'd say to the minister is this: 'You, the minister, should be providing this important industry with certainty and detail. Firstly, explain whether the required changes will be done through regulation or through legislation. Indeed, provide a timetable of when such changes will be released publicly and implemented. Further, provide a timetable for states and territories via the ministerial consumer affairs forum to examine and agree upon those changes. This is a matter of urgency.' The government's indifferent approachâthis uninterested government that has no focus on what matters in this countryâneeds to stop. What we need to see instead is manufacturers in this sector being looked after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they asked for the minister to respond to this a year ago, that response should have been expedited. In fact, it was able to be done because there's consent amongst jurisdictions in this country. It could have been done before the election. Instead, we now have a situation where Australian products made by Australian workers cannot use the 'Made in Australia' logo. I mean, how bad can it get for the government to act? When it gets to a point where jobs are at risk, manufacturers are at risk and their profits are at risk, all the minister can say is, 'We're doing everything we can.' The incompetence and inaction of this government must stop, because they threaten the livelihood of too many Australians and they affect a thriving sector. The government need to do a lot betterâand we expect them to do that very, very soon.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  As the chair of a local school for many years, I have grappled with how we best prepare our students for the future and ensure they remain engaged and enchanted by education throughout their schooling journey. As a university professor, I've become concerned about the unpreparedness of some for tertiary education after leaving school. Since becoming a member of parliament I have met with many principals across my electorateâin fact, so far, I have met with 27 of the 37 principalsâand we've had wide-ranging discussions. Some voiced concerns over educational benchmarking; others about the overcrowded syllabus. Most were concerned about attracting and retaining the best teachers. All wanted to ensure that they were providing the best educational experience for all students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians</span> was published in 2008 and has two primary aims: first, that Australian schooling promote equity and excellence; and, second, that all young Australians become successful learners, confident and creative individuals, and active and informed citizensâboth excellent goals. But, somewhere along the way, these goals have not translated to the outcomes we might wish for. Despite significant and increasing investment from federal, state and territory governments, our benchmarking data is showing a decline in educational standards. When I have asked my local principals why this might be, some said that, while we have made great strides with those students who are falling behindâwhich is a good news storyâthey were increasingly aware that we are failing to stretch our students at the more capable end of the spectrum. They said that we had created a cohort of cruisersâeffectively, that our educational system had foregone excellence for equity. I contend that, in our pursuit of equity, we have taken our eyes off excellence. If we wish to remain internationally competitive, we must extend our best and brightest, not just ensure minimal standards for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012 the then Baillieu government in my home state of Victoria held an inquiry into education. When questioned by the committee undertaking the inquiry in 2012, Professor Geoff Masters, CEO of the Australian Council for Educational Research, made this comment to the committee about our declining educational standards:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nobody knows exactly what is responsible for the decline â¦ what we do know is that â¦ we are now so focused on making sure that all students achieve at least minimally acceptable levels, schools have taken their eyes off extending our very high-achieving students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe our teachers and educators are ready to be part of a mature conversation about why our benchmarked standards are declining. We need to be at the forefront of helping ensure we have job ready students for the future. We need to be fearless in looking for the reason for our declining results. We need to extend all of our students and not just ensure that those left behind keep up. After all, the students of today are the unexpressed potential of our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we need to focus on the quality of our teachers. They are the essential ingredient in the educational recipe of success. Not only do we need to ensure we attract the right teachers with the right aptitude, but we also need to keep them engaged and continuing to learn and develop themselves. Like medicine, aptitude interviews for teacher education would identify those who have a strong passion for primary and secondary education. Like the medical profession, I believe teachers would benefit from a professional continuing education program to ensure we are investing in a profession that is growing the minds of the next generation. It is time for a rethink of the 2008 Melbourne declaration as we move into the century of the digital revolution, if we are to adequately prepare our children for the future of work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise to speak about the significant contribution of surf lifesaving clubs in my electorate of Corangamite and around the country. As far as I am aware, Corangamite has the largest participation of any federal electorate, with 12 clubs and a current membership of just under 10,000. And what a great job they do. Yesterday, at parliament, we had the launch of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National coastal safety report 2019</span>. There were 276 drowning deaths in 2018-19âa horrifying 10 per cent increase on the previous year. The 123 summer drownings represented a 17 per cent increase on the 10-year average. Coastal drownings were above the 15-year average of 110 drowning deaths a year. And it isn't just the 11 million people who participate in coastal activities who are at risk. While saving a tourist on Easter Sunday this year, father and son surf lifesavers Ross and Andrew Powell, from the Port Campbell Surf Life Saving Club, in the seat of Wannon, lost their lives during a rescue mission. Fellow surf lifesaver Phillip Younis was seriously injured. They made the ultimate sacrifice, putting the lives of others ahead of their own lives. At the time of the incident, Andrew was due to become a father for the first time. Frances, the new member of Ross's family, was born recently. My thoughts and best wishes go out to Andrew's widow, Amber, and young Frances. On behalf of my electorate, I stand with their loved ones and their fellow surf lifesavers and thank them for the sacrifices they make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each quarter, Surf Life Saving Australia recognises lifesavers who go above and beyond in their duties. The March National Rescue of the Month award went to three lifesavers from Corangamite. My congratulations to Michael Henderson, Alexander Buckley and Alex Schwarcz, from my club, Fairhaven Surf Life Saving Club. They received their award here, in Parliament House, last week, and I was so proud of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surf Life Saving Australia has recently provided parliamentarians with their national plan and priorities, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond 2020</span>. I support their very modest claim for annual funding of $16.5 million per year from the Commonwealth for the next three years. I say 'modest' because it seems such a small amount for the enormous impact these largely volunteer clubs have. In 2017-18, our nation's lifesavers performed over 10,000 rescues, 65,000 first aid treatments and 1.5 million preventative actions. In 2018-19, there were 584 hospitalisations as a result of non-fatal drowning incidents across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian coastline is a significant attraction, with 14.7 million visitors annually. But coastal drowning deaths and near misses are unacceptably high. By investing more in Surf Life Saving Australia, we can ensure that they can keep their water safety programs running. Surf lifesaving clubs train thousands of young Australians each year in Nipper and other programs, while Surf Life Saving Australia delivers a certificate II in aquatic safety, which is important to the skills base of those volunteers. Many drownings involve recently arrived migrant families from the city or international students who often have no awareness of rips or rogue waves. One of Surf Life Saving Australia's priorities is to reach out to people with culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, who often do not have the water skills that will keep them safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past 10 years, Surf Life Saving Australia has recruited and educated young people with diverse backgrounds in order to make them leaders and champions in their own communities. They are seeking $1.5 million a year to continue this important area of work. Surveillance and emergency response technologies, such as drone technology, can also make a significant difference to the work of our lifesavers. The adoption of these technologies is vital to ensuring that clubs can improve their rescue operations at surf safety hotspots around our coastline and keep an eye on beaches around the corner from patrolled beaches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our surf lifesaving clubs also provide a community hub, a place for locals to meet and socialise. In our coastal towns the clubs play a vital role in community-building that is the equal of the roles played by our footy and netball clubs. I will do everything I can to support their amazing contribution and their work to keep our beaches safe. I hope that the government will too.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Crime breaks and weakens cohesive and connected communities, it affects the way we interact with our neighbours and other members of the community, and it creates a breeding ground of mistrust, alarm, panic and fear. Crime has formed a barrier between safety and fear for many of the individuals, families, elderly residents and business owners who live and work in our communities, and it's this barrier we must work together to break. We must combat crime in order to build a stronger and safer community for all Australians, because every one of us deserves to live our life in peace and safety without the fear of crime, without an intruder breaking into our home and making off with the valuables we have worked so hard to purchase. You deserve to walk down the street at night without looking over your shoulder for fear of being assaulted, and you deserve to be able to leave your home and go to work or on holiday without worrying about whether you remembered to activate the alarm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many years ago, you could leave your car door unlocked and your front door wide open without the fear that someone would rob you of your valuables or your car. Today, sadly, that is no longer the case. Between 16 September 2018 and 16 September 2019, the Queensland Police Service division of Caboolture have dealt with 9,173 criminal offences. From these statistics, the highest numbers of offences committed were for theft, of which there were 2,950 offences, and drugs, of which there were 1,347 offences. The Bribie Island Queensland Police Service division have dealt with 1,633 offences in the last year: 274 of these were drug offences and 406 were theft. The suburb of Morayfield has seen 2,977 offences committed in the past year: 1,202 were theft and 390 were drug offences. All of these statistics are from the past year and just show how bad crime is for the community of Longman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is crime a cause for concern in our neighbourhoods but it can also impact the decisions of jobseekers and families to live in the area. This in turn can also affect tourism to the area and local businesses. Crime is expensive and can put a lot of added strain on the local economy. It places a huge financial burden on communities to prevent and combat criminal activity and clean up its aftermath.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to break and prevent the cycle of crime so that we can create a safer Australia for all Australians. In August, the new Caboolture Police Station and Moreton District Headquarters were opened on King Street in Caboolture, due to the continued growth in the area requiring a larger policing presence in the community. The new police station will house the Moreton North Criminal Investigation Branch, the Moreton North Child Protection and Investigation Unit and the district detective inspector. The new headquarters will also house officers from the Moreton District Intelligence Unit and the district operations coordinator, as well as the professional practice manager, brief manager, disaster executive officer, tactician, support services, and inspector and district office staff. This new, modern facility can comfortably accommodate 200 staff members within the station and 19 staff within the district headquarters. When the Caboolture Police Station was first established in 1871, the station was staffed by only one senior constable and one constable, and I am told it was built at a cost of 48 pounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take a moment to thank all the men and women in blue who are going above and beyond to protect the people of Longman and the rest of Australia. Thank you for all that you do for our communities. We also have many Neighbourhood Watch groups in the Longman electorate who work hard to provide a vital link between police and the community, enabling police to address community members' concerns about local crime, reducing the fear of crime and improving community safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, it's clear: we need to tackle the issue of drugs, and a new ice rehabilitation facility at Caboolture is the answer. We need to make sure there is plenty of information and facilities out there to give people the support they need and see them away from drugs. We need to create well-targeted programs, work on reducing youth crime, encourage people to make wise choices, educate our children and work with the police to stop and prevent crime from happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to look at the bigger picture. There's no excuse for crime. We need to look at the reason why people commit crime. Is it to get money, are they bored, do they think they can get away with it, or is a life of crime all they know? It's simple: they are linked. Statistics prove that, when unemployment rates drop, crime rates and drug use also decline. The numbers don't lie. It won't be easy, but we must work together to keep our families and our communities safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Those on this side of the House remember well this government, in the last term, raising its hands in a sort of collective Pontius Pilate 'nothing to see here' response when penalty rates were cut by the Fair Work Commission: 'We can't do anything about it. It's the Fair Work Commission, the independent umpire. Don't talk to us.' You can imagine my distress, as a Tasmanian member of parliament, to see that this government is going into bat against workers. An independent umpire, the Federal Court, has made a decision. The employer has decided to go to the High Court and appeal the Federal Court's decision, and this government is joining that action against the employees. I am of course talking of the Cadbury plant in my state, where last month workers won a very significant victory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Cadbury, workers are employed on three-day-per-week 12-hour shifts. Twelve hours is a long time. It's now 10 to eight in the evening. If this was a 12-hour day, we would've started at 10 to eight this morning. Imagine doing that three days a week and that's your entire working life. And then of course you've also got night shifts sometimes. These are long days. For years Cadbury, the company, has been putting people on these 12-hour shifts under the EBAâthe union is involvedâbut only paying the workers on sick leave and carers leave for 7.6 hours. So it's a 12-hour day, but if you're sick you only get paid for 7.6 hours. It's in the employer's interests to have these 12-hour daysâgood. That's a negotiated position with the workers. But they're only paying the workers sick leave of 7.6 hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two employees of Cadbury, Brendan and Natasha, took the company to the Federal Court last year and won. The Federal Court agreed: 'Yes, you work a 12-hour day, therefore you should get 12 hours sick leave.' The company said: 'This is no good. We don't want this. We're going to appeal.' Fair enough; that it's right as an employer. But the governmentâthis government which has told workers throughout the country that it won't get involved, it won't stop penalty rates going ahead, because of the independent umpireâis more than willing to go against the independent umpire, in this case the Federal Court, and join this action against these workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will quote the AMWU secretary, John Short, who goes into bat for these workers at Cadbury, when the decision was first made by the Federal Court:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Shift workers around Australia can breathe a sigh of relief today thanks to AMWU members Natasha and Brendan who stood up against Mondelezâ</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the multinational that now owns Cadburyâ</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">and won this case â¦ This was an appalling attempt by a very profitable multinational company to rob its workers of the leave that they are entitled to â¦ If you need to take a sick day, you should be paid for your normal hours of work, it's as simple as that â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Short was quite right. If you're working a 12-hour day and you're sick, you should be paid 12 hours of sick leave. It's just simple. Yet the company said, 'No, we want to reduce it to keep that at 7.6 hours,' and this government said, 'We'll join in on that; we'll go into bat for the company and seek to reduce that pay.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government cries that it's bound by the independent umpire when it comes to penalty ratesâwhich, funnily enough, cut workers' wagesâbut when there's an independent umpire's decision in favour of workers, in favour of paying higher wages, this government is more than happy to step in, go against the decision of the independent umpire and join an action against a decision that's in the interests of employees, which if successful will end up with workers having less pay in their pockets. It is absolutely outrageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mondelez is a multinational company with revenue of $25 billion. We're not talking about a mum-and-pop corner store here. It is a very big company with very deep pockets. This government says everyone should accept the Fair Work Commission's decision when it comes to penalty rates, but here the government is wanting to play judge and jury and get involved. If the Prime Minister is serious about respecting the independence of an independent arbiter, he really should be telling the Attorney-General to back away from this and let the company fight its own fight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community groups also played a large role in the success of the fair. With the SES, the Central Coast marine rescue, Terrigal Wamberal Little Athletics and the Terrigal surf club all holding stalls. The fair had sponsorship from 40 local businesses that provided goods for the auction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would really like to thank the principal, Michael Burgess, for his role in helping to coordinate, and his leadership on such a fantastic day for the entire school community, and also to recognise the ongoing leadership that he provides to the school on a daily basis. Special thanks also to Michael for taking time out to show me personally around the fair. It was much appreciated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also pay tribute to the tireless Briony Cameron as the Terrigal Family Fun Fair coordinator. Briony spent many months making sure that the event was the success that it was. These fairs take an army of volunteers and Briony was supported by a wonderful team. Congratulations to the Terrigal Public School P&amp;C President, Nicole McDonald; Secretary, Trish Payne; Treasurer, Ari King; Sponsorship Coordinator, Tonia Barclay; Social Media and Advertising Coordinator, Junna Massey; Food Coordinator, Bec Wallace; and Kids' Fun Zone Coordinatorâwhich was also spectacularâHannah McKeen. The committee was also supported by more than 400 volunteers who all helped to bring it together on the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the final amount is still being counted, I would like to congratulate everyone involved for another successful fair. Of course, all fundraising goes towards continuing to contribute to Terrigal Public School's activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Avoca Beach Public School also held their 2019 school fair on Sunday, with nature and sustainability a main focus of its stalls and events. The event is the annual fundraiser for the school's P&amp;C, with fundraising efforts from previous years going towards projects like building an outdoor learning area for their basketball court and computers for students to use in school. I would like to congratulate the P&amp;C on another wonderful event for their local school community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This coming Saturday at my old local school, St Philip's Christian College, they'll be holding their annual Gosford spring fair. It will include art, fashion, craft, stalls, rides and entertainmentâwith camel rides being one of the fair's newest attractions. It's certainly not something I remember during my time at school there. But I don't think there are too many opportunities to ride a camel on the Central Coast, so I'm sure it will be a great attraction. This is anticipated to be one of St Philip's biggest events for the year. The fair wouldn't be possible without the contributions of everyone from the school and the wider community. I'm looking forward to attending again this year in what I am sure will be another huge success for the school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend is also important for another local school, with Chertsey Primary School in Springfield celebrating their 50th anniversary with a huge celebration. The celebration of the school's history will be a coming together of Chertsey's past and present students with a full day of activities and sharing of memories. I'd like to thank Naomi Gay, Nada Potter and the 50th anniversary committee for inviting me to their special event. I look forward to joining them at the official opening of these festivities and taking my kids along to the fair afterwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These school fairs take a lot work from everyone involved and really need the work of the principal. They showcase how dedicated our local teachers are. I'd like to pay tribute, in the closing seconds, to our local teachers right across the Central Coast. I know many of them work day and night for their students, and their work goes far beyond the classroom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly pay tribute to a teacher from my electorate, who was recently recognised for her contribution to the teaching profession. Natalie MacDonald, the newly appointed principal at Erina Heights Public School, was recognised as one of 10 lead teachers in New South Wales at the Highly Accomplished and Lead Teacher Awards. Natalie is just one example of the many, many teachers across the Central Coast who work so tirelessly and with such dedication for their students. I encourage everyone to get out this weekend, or over the coming weeks, and attend their local schools' fairs. I look forward to seeing you there.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Recently I was approached by leaders of our local Cambodian community, who let me know that they were planning a special event to mark 100 days since the death of the Hon. Bob Hawke, in keeping with Cambodian and Buddhist traditions. They invited me to the event, and of course I was honoured to accept. It was an incredibly moving thing for the Cambodian community to have the thoughtfulness to organise. I took the liberty of letting Bob's widow, Blanche d'Alpuget, know that this event was occurring and I invited her to it. I was absolutely delighted that she could accept the invitation and accompany me to the commemoration of 100 days since the death of Bob Hawke. We were both accompanied by Bob's close friend and former adviser the Hon. Craig Emerson. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Blanche was very moved by the event. To arrive at the Khemarangsaram temple in Bonnyrigg to be welcomed by big pictures of Bob Hawke, to see around 100 members of the Cambodian community wearing Bob Hawke badges and to see the monks chanting in memory of Bob Hawke was incredibly moving for everyone. It says a lot about the genuineness of our Cambodian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cambodian community remembers Bob fondly for several reasons. Firstly, of course, the Paris peace accords would not have been achieved without the Hawke Labor government and the leadership of both Bill Hayden and Gareth Evans as successive foreign ministers. But they knew they had the backing of their Prime Minister for Australia to take a leading role in international diplomacy to bring democracy back to Cambodia. Also, of course, the Cambodian community remembered Bob's generous attitude towards Cambodian refugees and his activist approach. As I said in my remarks at the commemoration, we should also remember that Bob's approach to Cambodian refugees was a continuation of the approach of Malcolm Fraser. That should be recognised in a bipartisan fashion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was struck that one of the leaders of the Cambodian community actuallyâI'm sure he won't mind me telling the Houseâbroke down in tears as he was delivering his eulogy of Bob Hawke. The Cambodian community also noted Medicare and what it meant to them to come to a country with universal health care. They remembered Bob Hawke as the father of Medicare. It was an incredibly moving event, and I was absolutely delighted that Blanche and Craig could join me at that event at the Bonnyrigg temple.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on record in the Parliament of Australia my thanks to the Cambodian community and the temple for organising the event from scratch, at their own instigation, of their own volition, and for taking the time on their Sunday morning to remember Bob Hawke. Again as I said at the temple, it's a reminder to all of us in this House that Australia played a key role in democracy going to Cambodia and must continue to play a key role to see democracy restored to Cambodia.</span>

This is becoming incredibly more evident when we see so many of our irrigation communities in severe drought throughout New South Walesâand the effects of the drought are still very prevalent in my region of Nicholls. Even though the crops and the pastures are looking good, we are in a very nervous situation. We need some more spring rains to get through the next two to three months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are serious cracks appearing in the social fabric of our regional communities. Over the last week I've spoken to a number of members of state governments, producer representatives, individual farmers, industry representatives and brokers. Federal members and senators representing the southern connected basin are working together to try and target solutions. Victorian irrigators, particularly in the Goulburn-Murray region, are at breaking point. A healthy Murray-Darling Basin is one that balances environmental objectives with the social and economic objectives of a community. But, right now, that social and economic balance isn't being experienced at all. To date, more than 2,100 gigalitres of the 2,750 target set out in the Basin Plan have been returned to the environment. So far Victoria has done the bulk of the heavy lifting, with 810 gigalitres of that water being recovered from Victorian irrigators; that's equivalent to the water use of about 4,000 average-sized Victorian dairy farms. On top of this we have the inter-valley water trade, which is pushing the water market over $800 a megalitre. That makes it cost prohibitive for many of our dairy farmers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That this Federal Council notes the dire circumstances facing irrigators in Victoria and southern NSW and strongly opposes the recovery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan's 450GL of up water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That this Federal Council calls on the Federal Government to direct the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder to trade 300GL for immediate use by drought impacted communities in Victoria and NSW to ensure critical food production and manufacturing businesses remain viable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an absolute crisis out there throughout the drought-affected areas. When there is water in the storages that our farmers can't reach, it makes it even harder for our farmers to understand what the Murray-Darling Basin is all about.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  One of the most rewarding parts of our work as representatives is meeting and working with schools and their communities both in our electorates and in this place. In this place it's an opportunity to talk about representation and democracy, and how this place can work for communities right across the country. Sometimes it's an antidote for school groups that have just been through the rigour and rough-and-tumble of question time! In this sitting fortnight I have met with two school communities from the electorate of Bean. I have also had work experience students from Melrose High School experience the sitting weeks; thank you, Harper and Caitlin, for your efforts this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I met with students and teachers from Charles Conder Primary School, from the southern part of the ACT. Yesterday I met with students and teachers from Norfolk Island Central School, a kinder to year 12 school on Norfolk Island. This group has travelled almost 2,000 kilometres to be here in the nation's capital; it's a long way to go to meet your federal representative! At the moment the New South Wales government is responsible for delivering education services on Norfolk Islandâa relationship that began in 1906. These arrangements have provided the community with certainty and continuity in terms of application of the New South Wales curriculum and access to quality staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the then Prime Minister attempted to convince the ACT government to take responsibility for the delivery of education services. Since then it has emerged that the New South Wales government will not be seeking to renew the contract for education services and will be looking to withdraw services from July 2021. As one could imagine, this has created considerable uncertainty for the Norfolk Island community, particularly the communities, parents and teachers in the school community. A change of jurisdiction will affect assessment processes and any medium-term to long-term education planning, let alone impact on teaching futures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July I wrote to the relevant minister, urging her to work with the community to find a long-term education partner and resolve this uncertainty as a priority. Unfortunately, the response I received provided me with little confidence that this government is treating this with the urgency it requires. Norfolk Island Central School is a cornerstone of the Norfolk Island community. It's a wonderful school. Children in this community, like those in any Australian community, deserve certainty of ongoing access to quality education. Parents and staff in this community deserve to be respected like any other part of Bean and the Australian community.</span>

India has banned the acceptance of plastic. We in the coalition government have announced that we are taking responsibility for our own waste, but I want to highlight that our recycling efforts could go a lot further to solving another problem that the nation facesâour liquid fuel security problem or our liquid fuel insecurity problem, which is a better way of describing it, because we have a slowly emerging phenomenon of less and less refinery capacity, more reliance on overseas liquid fuel and more reliance on overseas refinery capacity. We all see, as each week goes by, that the Strait of Hormuz and nearby countriesâoil-rich nations which supply not only Australia but a lot of the rest of the worldâcould be embroiled, and we could be short of 17 per cent to 18 per cent of all our processed fuel overnight, if that chain of events were to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have a huge waste burden in this nation that could go part way to solving our problem. I bring to the attention of the House that there is technology that is Australian developed and patented that turns end-of-life plastic into liquid fuel. A lot of the plastics get lumped together with lots of other things like tyres and rubber, but a lot of plastics have carbon in them, and there is technology that, after initially heating it with gas, turns some of the waste into liquid fuel: 80 per cent diesel and 20 per cent petrol and LPG. A thousand tonnes of waste could end up as 1,062 litres of fuel. It would meet the EN 590 standard and the EN 228 standard, which are the European standards for diesel and fuel. It could go a long way to coping with that huge burden of plastic waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also green technologies, Australian developed, that make crude oil out of tyre waste, as well as recycling steel-belted radials, which contain metal that can be recovered. All these technologies are actually recycling what started off as oil and was refinedâbecause plastics come from oilâback into oil and diesel, which closes the circle. It solves the landfill problem and it addresses, as I said, our emerging insecurity in liquid fuel. Everyone talks about batteries, but liquid fuel is what the nation runs on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  It was recently Early Learning Matters Week, and I had the great honour of visiting two childcare centres in the electorate of Barton. The week celebrates our early educators and the critical role they play in educating our children. Outside of their families, it is these early educators who spend the most time with our children in their early learning phase. As we all know, 90 per cent of the child's brain develops in the first five years. The learning experience provided by early educators creates a positive and significant impact throughout the rest of a young child's education. It is absolutely critical that we continue to support and recognise this impact. We must acknowledge that early educators are skilled professionals who are laying down the foundations for our children's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted to visit the Gowrie early learning centre located in Clemton Park Public School. The centre hosts a wonderful outdoor area, featuring sandpits, natural gardens and water play areas, all designed to encourage a hands-on approach to learning. I congratulate Amee Patel, Vicky and the rest of the educators and staff at Gowrie for their continued dedication to this wonderful place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to congratulate Lisa and the team at the Uniting Frederick Street Preschool in Rockdale. Run by the Uniting Church, the preschool hosts children from the ages of three to five. It is also home to a very vibrant and colourful outdoor areaâa beautiful school, full of equipment and activities, designed to inspire our children's curiosity, creativity and self-expression. How wonderfully creative and inclusive of all children is this school! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I wish to thank both preschools for their invitations and their continued dedication in providing quality early education for our children in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to congratulate and thank Sunnyfield Disability Services for allowing me to visit their Bexley North centre and providing me with the opportunity to meet their clients and observe their new facilities. It was a wonderful morning. At the morning tea, I met many of the people that go there every day, and I met the staff. They were incredibly committed, very much in love with their jobs and absolutely caring about the people that attend Sunnyfield. I congratulate Jenny, Angela and Caroline and the rest of the staff at Sunnyfield for their continued service to the community. I wish to thank Caroline, the CEO and also the chairperson, who was also in attendance that day at Sunnyfield. It was a wonderful morning, and it makes you understand the very deep and real needs of people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  I rise to congratulate the members of the Port Bouvard Surf Lifesaving Club, who, on Saturday last weekend, opened the second storey of their clubhouse. It's been a long time in coming, and I was very glad to join with them and celebrate this moment. The Port Bouvard Surf Lifesaving Club are an important part of our community. They are dedicated to keeping people safe on our beaches, particularly down in Dawesville and Falcon. Their culture is one of service and sacrifice, and they give 1,500 hours of service per year, every year, to our community on our beaches. So I congratulate them for their work. It was a pleasure to join with president John Hodge, past presidents, life members and members of the club and some notable people there on the weekend: Mark Fenton, Murray Horbury, Damien Mahoney, Sarah Hull and Jeff Kallawk. It was a very lovely afternoon overlooking the Indian Ocean. We were also joined by state MPs and members of local government as well as the chair of the Peel Development Commission, Paddi Creevey. All representatives contributed in one way or another to this second storey. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a very long journey to this point. The first level of the clubhouse was completed in 2008, and that was the vision of the late Ric Roberts. It was great to see his wife, Sue, there on the weekend as part of our celebrations. The second level was always part of the vision, and the club has managed to overcome financial constraints to get there. Importantly, the federal government contributed $1 million. I was there with then Prime Minister Tony Abbott on 22 August 2015, when we contributed $1 million towards the second storey. The state government also contributed money. The former member for Dawesville, Kim Hames, was instrumental, and of course the City of Mandurah contributed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very special to be joined by the family of the late Don Randall, the former member for Canning, his wife, Julie, daughter, Tess, son, Elliott, and the two sisters, Nola and Delys. It was a very special occasion because we celebrated the opening of the second storey but we also remembered Don. He was a much-loved patron and supporter of the club. He loved the club and they loved him. So they honoured his memory on the weekend by naming the function room the Randall Room. His family were there to celebrate with us, and it was great to see them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the federal member and speaking on behalf of the government, can I just say to the club: congratulations; it's great to see the job done. I'll be working with them over the coming months and years to make sure the bar and the kitchen are fully fitted out so it can go commercial.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  All of us going about our job have the great honour to meet people regularly in our communities who are doing amazing service, very often as volunteers in support of their community that they love. I want to talk to the House in the time I have today about two such people in my area. In May I was very honoured to attend a special presentation for the City of Wollongong RSL Sub-Branch president Peter Poulton. Peter was awarded the RSL Meritorious Service Medal by RSL New South Wales state president James Brown. This is the highest recognition available to RSL members in Australia and it came on top of Peter having been awarded RSL New South Wales life membership. The award was to acknowledge Peter's significant contributions to the serving and ex-service community of the Australian Defence Force over three decadesâwith more than two decades as president of the Wollongong subbranch. Both the state president and the City of Wollongong RSL subbranch honorary secretary, Joe Davidson, spoke at the event. They detailed the extensive work Peter has done from his deep commitment to the wellbeing and welfare of ex-service and serving members of the ADF. It was great to see so many locals in attendance at this special event, including members of Peter's familyâwho have provided so much support to him in all of his community workâlocal representatives other than me and other members of the RSL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter has provided service in many different capacities since he joined the RSL in 1986. He has stepped up all the time into leadership roles and has taken on tasks to support the subbranch, as well the RSL's district council and the day club committee. I've seen so much of Peter's work at the local level, particularly in things like the Illawarra Anzac Day school program and the 2015 Illawarra Centenary of Anzac event. Peter is a very valued and very well-loved member of our community, and it was wonderful to be with him on this occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge Dulcie Dal Molin. Dulcie has an amazing record of dedication and contribution to my Port Kembla communityâin particular, to the Red Point Artists Association. Last night, Dulcie became the first person to receive life membership of the Red Point Artists Association. She was integral in the formation of the association in 2008. At the time, Wentworth Street was really struggling, and she has been the president since then. Its creative pursuits under Dulcie's leadership became a vehicle that has helped to heal and revitalise Wentworth Street. She also is a much-loved and very well-respected member of that community. The facilities that she has helped champion and lead are a great asset to that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to both Peter and Dulcie.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  The Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers celebrates its 70th year this year with 10 days of celebrations, featuring the iconic street parade through our city this Saturday 21 September. The carnival was initiated back in 1949 by the then Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce to lift the spirits of our community following World War II and to promote increased economic activity. On 28 October 1950, the first parade stretched three miles in length. It was led by a bullock team and watched by a crowd that was estimated at the time to be about 50,000 strongâcertainly likely to be greater than our population at that point in time. That was a resounding success, I'm told by reading history. Last year we attracted 255,000 visitors to our region, returning some $26 million to the city in direct benefits, as estimated by the chamber of commerce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers has been honoured to receive the gold award for major festival and event at the Queensland Tourism Awards in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and at the Australian Tourism Awards in 2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition, the carnival of flowers, very proudly for all of us, received the Hall of Fame award at the 2017 Queensland Tourism Awards and the 2018 Australian Tourism Awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To celebrate the iconic event's 70-year history, on the program this year there'll be some 77 events over 10 days. To name just a few, there will be the Heritage Bank Festival of Food and Wineâand, yes, I'll be attending thatâthe grand central floral parade, gala dinners, night garden tours, historical displays, exhibitions, shows, classes, garden tours, memorabilia displays, art and craft, and photography. At the heart of this event, as always, is <span style="font-style:italic;">The Chronicle</span> garden competition. Over the last seven decades, residents in our city have opened up their own gardens and homes to visitors from the local region and tourists from around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember enjoying the various carnival activities with my parents and siblings as a young boy in the 1970s and taking my own children over the years, and nowadays I watch them take their partners. I'm simply an example of so many locals who, over the decades, have grown up with this magnificent carnival. I wish all locals and visitors a wonderful carnival. I pay tribute to the staff of Toowoomba Regional Council in particular, and I thank in advance the many volunteers who make our community tick. Amongst others, they will be doing us proud again this coming weekend and over the next 10 days.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  On 7 September in my electorate of Fremantle, and around Australia, we marked National Threatened Species Day. It's always an important occasion because Australian species, both flora and fauna, are under threat. Indeed, since the time of European settlement, more than 130 species have disappeared. They are gone forever. And the list of species threatened with extinction continues to grow. We're blessed by the fact that Australia is a megadiverse nation and continentâ80 per cent of our mammals and 90 per cent of our trees, ferns and shrubs occur nowhere else on the planetâbut we are facing an extinction crisis. The main causes of this crisis are destruction of habitat and the harm caused by invasive species. Our marine ecosystems are also under threat from climate change, overfishing and plastic waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government is intent on waging a war on so-called green tape more than it is on responding to the extinction crisis. It's responsible for the largest wind-back of marine protection in our history. It has cut Landcare funding. It's estimated that there are recovery plans for only 40 per cent of threatened species since the coalition decided it was smart to remove the obligation to have such plans in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, Labor went to the recent election with a commitment to introduce a native species protection fund, with $100 million in funding, and to support work in tackling Australia's most critically endangered species through that fund. We also proposed a much-needed reform of Australia's environmental laws through the introduction of a new federal environment act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Western Australia, there are 678 animals and plants on the threatened species list. In my electorate of Fremantle alone, there are 54 threatened species and ecological communities, including the well-known and much-loved quokka, the Banksia Woodlands and Carnaby's black cockatoo. I want to thank local community groups such as Native ARC, the Cockburn Wetlands Centre and the Rottnest Foundation for their vital conservation work in my part of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I joined Murdoch University PhD student Anthony Santoro at the Beeliar Wetlands to learn about his work in seeking to protect the southwestern snake-necked turtle, which is at risk because habitat modification means turtles cannot lay their eggs without being exposed to both vehicles and predation by foxes. With the support of the City of Cockburn, Anthony has built and installed nesting cages along the wetland shore with the aim of providing safe nests and hatching grounds. It is exactly the kind of species-specific work we need to promote, and yet such efforts are being hampered by this government's cuts to programs like Landcare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many of our native species are on the brink. We have the worst record in the world when it comes to mammal extinctions, yet we have a coalition government that doesn't believe in climate change, has weakened environmental protection and is cutting funds for conservation and land management.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Our lifestyle in Brisbane makes it one of the very best places to live, work, raise a family and retire. So it's no wonder that South-East Queensland is one of the fastest growing regions around Australia. I often say that the challenge of managing growth is fundamentally a good problem to have if the alternative means jobs leaving town, people moving away and no upcoming projects or opportunities to get excited about. Yet it also means that we face an ongoing need for significant, sustained investment, including in infrastructure, to ensure that Brisbane doesn't risk its prized liveability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why projects like the Brisbane Metro are so critical, and it's why many around Brisbane are becoming frustrated at the inaction and reckless political game-playing we're seeing now from the Queensland state Labor government. The Brisbane Metro project is a game changer. It will change the face of our city. It will slash travel times, bust congestion and revolutionise the way that we get around our city. It's rated by Infrastructure Australia as a national high priority and, thanks to this federal government and the Brisbane City Council working together, it's fully funded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't require a single cent from the state Labor government. All it requires is their approval for the go-ahead. So, after 3Â½ years and over 270 meetingsâand countingâbetween the council and the state government, Premier Palaszczuk's team won't make a decision. The Labor Party, it seems, are determined to delay, to obstruct and to do everything in their power to deny their own constituents the benefit of a vital infrastructure project between now and their next election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Queensland Labor has form when it comes to playing political games with their approvals. We know this from their botched handling of their approvals for mines, where both sides of that debate would be united in their joint criticism of the state Labor government. So they've been busted before, and now they're busted again. What might surprise many Queenslanders is that the Palaszczuk Labor government isn't just willing to play these political games in the regions; they're also clearly willing to play these political games in the heart of the city, where many of their ministers are from and where they garner much of their political support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordinarily, most Australians shouldn't have to think too much about whether the transport infrastructure they're using was delivered by Liberal or by Labor. But that could change if it becomes clear that a particular political party is demonstrating a pattern of behaviour that's holding back important projects.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  The first question that I have for the government and the Minister representing the Minister for Defence is the pretty fundamental subject of the revolving door of ministers within the Defence portfolio since 2013. How in that circumstance can the Australian public possibly have any confidence that this government is managing the particularly challenging strategic circumstances which our government and our nation face today?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, we have prolonged deployments in the Middle East. We have just announced participation in a new deployment in terms of maintaining safety around the Strait of Hormuz. We have a very difficult situation with respect to the nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula through the actions of the North Korean regime. We have a whole range of threats to our near neighbourhood in the Pacific, particularly in respect of climate change, which give rise to their own security concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have China, whose rise has been in many respects a positive thing for our nation but, as great powers do, it is seeking to shape the global rules based order around it, and that does raise challenging questions for our nation. And we have an American presidentâwho leads our most important ally, the country which has been at the centre of our national security framework since 1942âpursuing his business on the basis of seeing unpredictability as a virtue. These circumstances combined give rise in many ways to the most challenging set of strategic circumstances that Australia has faced since the Second World War. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just me who is saying that. Indeed, the defence minister, if I may quote her, made much the same point at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June of this year. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are currently seeing the return of old challenges and the emergence of new ones: major-power rivalries; trade, investment and infrastructure being used as tools to build strategic influence; North Koreaâs dangerous nuclear missile activities; challenges to international law and norms including in the South China Sea; and growing security threats such as terrorism, cyber-warfare and climate change.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that is a fair assessment of the circumstances that we face. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence, at the moment, is going through a $200 billion investment program to modernise Australia's defence assets. Again, it's a really important program. Yet in the face of all of thatâmanaging these strategic circumstances and managing a build-up which is as significant as any during our peacetime historyâwe have seen 24 ministers across the broader defence portfolio since 2013: five defence ministers, five assistant defence ministers, six defence industry ministers, three defence personnel ministers and five veterans affairs ministers. I'm really interested to hear from the government and the minister representing the defence minister how, against that background of change in the context of that revolving door, you manage to maintain a consistent attitude to all the challenges that our nation faces today. </span>

They all know, every single one of them, that the number of ministers in this portfolio has been an absolute disgrace. You know it. The government know it. The government know that churning a defence minister at a rate of about one every 16 months is not the way you behave to inspire in the Australian people confidence about how you manage the very significant agenda in this space which our nation faces today. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the government is this: how can Australians have any confidence in the government's administration of this portfolio, the complex nature of the strategic circumstances that we face and the complex build-up of our defence assets when it is churning its defence ministers at such a frighteningly fast rate?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to ask the minister about an issue close to my heart, and that is the Defence Force's ability to respond to the call of duty from its bases in my electorate of Herbert. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many in this place would be aware, I spent a lot of time at Lavarack Barracks as a part of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Since Lavarack Barracks was opened in July 1966 by the then Prime Minister Harold Holt, North Queensland has been home to soldiers deployed on every conventional operation from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Today, the 3rd Brigade in Townsville represents a considerable element of the Army's deployable combat power. Townsville's military estates at Lavarack Barracks and the Royal Australian Air Force base at Garbutt are home to units of the 3rd Brigade, the 5th Aviation Regiment and the 10th Force Support Battalion, also known as 10 FSB, all of which have a long and distinguished service record and a strong relationship with the community of North Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, as the Army's deployable combat brigade, the 3rd Brigade led training and mentoring missions in Afghanistan and Iraq and led contributions to counterterrorism mentoring operations in the Philippines. Regionally, the 3rd Brigade also contributed to APEC forum security operations in Papua New Guinea. These operations involved over 1,500 personnel deployed to critical operations over a 12-month period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the Townsville based forces have been principally tasked with regional engagement, following a period of very high tempo in 2018. Key international activities in 2019 have included leading Army's military-to-military relationship with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. Townsville units conducted a range of activities and exchanges with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force under exercise Wantok Warrior as part of the Pacific support team. Another key activity was the self-deployment of the 5th Aviation Regiment MRH90 Taipan helicopters to support the Solomon Islands national election in March and April 2019. It's clear to see that the ADF's operations based in Townsville are of absolute importance to the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also suggest that they are critical to the fabric of our local community. There are more than 5,000 regular and continuous full-time serving personnel in my electorate plus more than 2Â½ thousand spouses and around 3,000 children in Defence Force families. Last financial year nearly $270 million was spent on employee wages, so the impact on the economy of Defence's activities in my electorate can't be understated. Fortunately for our city, many people who discharge from the service choose to stay and settle permanently in Townsville. This has only positive outcomes for our community, which is always seeking to grow and retain those who move to our city for work. Many people with valuable skills learned in Defence can translate those skills into civilian life and have a good impact on our area. So I look forward to the ADF maintaining its presence in the region and thus continuing to support our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that in mind, it gave me great pride in February this year to witness firsthand the response of Defence to the disastrous monsoon which hit our region. The demonstration of Defence's value to the community was exemplified through the significant contribution to the state led flood response efforts. Army's contributions included the Joint Task Force 658 Operation North Queensland Flood Assist over the period from 2 to 15 February. In addition to over 3,000 Army personnel, Army provided a range of vehicles, watercraft, engineering and helicopters to assist local communities. There is also a large veteran community in Herbert, and we all banded together, which saw me on a boat, to my wife's disgust, going down the street helping my mates in the community evacuate their houses. It is something that I've never seen beforeâgoing down a street where people are sitting on the roofs of their houses, not knowing if they are going to make it out alive or not. We know that northern Australia and the tropics, in particular, are susceptible to severe weather, so it's great to have those capabilities on our doorstep. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With all this in mind, I ask the minister: what is the current status of the Australian Defence Force's posture in northern Australia? </span>

The 3rd Brigade, based at Lavarack Barracks, does our nation proud, and I thank the member for Herbert for his service. I remember being at the 3rd Brigade with the Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral, in which the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, 1RAR, participated. It reminded us all of the wonderful work that 3rd Brigade has done in the past and continues to do in the service of our nationâand, as the member said, not just the service of our nation in deployment but the service of our nation in dealing with natural disasters in North Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question concerns the government's mismanagement to this point in time of the Future Submarine project, which is a profoundly critical platform for Australia's defence capability and, indeed, our projection for decades to come. When will the promised 2,800 Australian jobs which are associated with this project actually materialise? We hear a lot from the coalition themselves about their record when it comes to their credentials around national security. But the truth is that, when we actually look at the record on the ground, it is nowhere near as rosy as their own rhetoric.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the Future Submarine project, we see a record that has been characterised from the outset by chaos. The very first defence minister of the five that I mentioned earlier, Senator Johnston, publicly questioned, when this government came to office in 2013, whether Australia actually needed 12 future submarines, and, in the process, stoked fears around the nation that he would encourage an overseas build. He went on, the following year, to infamously declare that he wouldn't have trusted the ASC to build a canoe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just weeks later Senator Johnston deeply regretted those words, as he was replaced by the next defence minister, Kevin Andrews. Kevin Andrews worked very, very quickly through a process which would have allowed the government to send the build of the submarines offshore. Indeed, in February 2015, the then defence minister, Mr Andrews, announced the competitive evaluation process, which would have provided:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ options for design and build overseas, in Australia, and/or a hybrid approach â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time the defence minister, Mr Andrews, said, in order to avoid a capability gap, the Future Submarine:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ must be delivered in time to avoid a capability gap in the mid-2020s when the Collins class submarine is scheduled to be retired from service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Andrews only lasted in this portfolio until September of that year, when the prime ministership of the country changed and, with it, Australia got its third defence minister in two years. But it wasn't just the Prime Minister and the defence minister that changed. Indeed, in the 2016 white paper we saw, in relation to the future submarines, the statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The acquisition of the 12 future submarines will commence in 2016 with the first submarines likely to begin entering service in the early 2030s. Construction of the 12 new submarines will extend into the late 2040s to 2050 timeframe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a slippage, right then, of the better part of a decade. Indeed, when Mr Abbott was asked about this question after his time as the Prime Minister, he said:</span>
                </p>

Most commentators are talking about it being delivered in the mid-2030s. In fact, I think that phrase is the last articulation by the government of the time line. So my question is this: when will the first future submarine come into active service? And, in the building of that submarine and the entire program, how many of those jobs will actually be located in Adelaide?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  The first role of the federal government is to keep Australians safe. I'm sure the member for Corio, the shadow minister, would agree with me on that point. That is why, as government, we're investing more than $200 billion in Australia's defence capability over the next decade. We want to keep Australians safe and secure, and to do that we need to have a strong economy. Our unparalleled rejuvenation of the Defence Force includes 57 naval vessels in Australia, modernising our army and introducing our world-leading fifth generation Air Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have got to say to the member for Corio, on this side of the House we are proud of our commitment to the Australian Defence Force. We are proud of the certainty and stability we're providing. Also, most of all, we're proud of every man and woman who puts on the uniform and potentially places themselves in harm's way to help those who can't necessarily help themselves. The certainty and stability I can promise to the shadow minister is that the current team of defence ministers are very happy to stay in their roles for many, many years to come. The Minister for Defence, Senator Linda Reynolds, was the first female brigadier of the Australian Army. She's a highly capable individual. She is well qualified to undertake the role that she had been given by the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree with the shadow minister, to some extent. There are a challenging set of strategic circumstances that we as a nation face, and the government is investing in our Australian service men and women, in our defence estate, in our capability and, most of all, in the equipment to make sure that the men and women who put on that uniform are well positioned and well supported as they undertake their difficult tasks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the strategic decisions that the minister had to make in recent times, which I'm sure the shadow minister is well aware of, was the decision to deploy our men and women to the Strait of Hormuz. The government is deeply concerned about the security involving shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. That's why the government has reaffirmed its longstanding commitment to safe passage and freedom of navigation in the Middle East by contributing to the international maritime security construct. I implore and encourage the shadow minister to work as closely as he can with the minister herself on these important strategic decisions. I will endeavour to ensure that, in my other role as Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel, we certainly have a bipartisan approach, if we possibly can, on these sometimes difficult issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left, I want to refer to questions raised by the member for Herbert, and, in addressing those, I join with the member for Corio in saying thank you for your service and thank you for your willingness to put on the uniform of our nation. Like you, Member for Herbert, I was extraordinarily impressed by the resilience and the capability of our men and women during that most difficult period in Townsville when the quite extraordinary flooding events occurred. To see Australian Defence Force personnel on the ground, in floodwaters and in the air supporting their fellow Australians at a time of great difficulty was something that as a nation we took great heart and comfort from. Townsville is a magnificent garrison city. It is an extraordinary city in terms of the serving men and women who are based there, and, as you correctly indicated, the number of veterans in that community is a cause for regular visits by the Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel. Sometimes the conversations are a little bit robust. You, as the member for Herbert, have represented your people with great endeavour and enthusiasm and you've endeavoured to make sure that veterans and their families are well supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to your question, Member for Herbert, regarding the defence posture in northern Australia more broadly, the government recognises the vital importance of northern Australia to our national security. That's why we're committed to a strong Australian Defence Force presence in the country's north, and we're undertaking significant investment in the broader region over the next decade. In the order of $8 billion will be invested in defence infrastructure in the Northern Territory alone. Through this government's Local Industry Capability Plan initiative, we're ensuring that opportunities for local industry involvement in defence infrastructure projects are maximised. I note the presence of the minister herself here today in terms of defence industry and the work she's doing to make sure that the Australian defence industry has every opportunity to participate in the procurement processes. Northern Australia is key to Australia's international engagement in supporting our strategic partnerships, with more than 13,000 defence members stationed in the north and thousands more participating in operations or training scenarios across the north annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, this government is proud of its record in terms of the investment in our Defence Force capabilities. We are proud of the men and women who put on the Navy uniform, the Army uniform and the Air Force uniform, and who potentially place themselves in harm's way to help people who can't necessarily help themselves. We're certainly proud of our record in supporting our veterans and their families when they transition out of the Australian Defence Force.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister also mentioned the recent decision of the government in relation to participation in the international maritime security mission in the Strait of Hormuz. I would like to ask the minister a further question in relation to that decisionâa decision which, I might say at the outset, Labor very much supports. Like the government, we are concerned about the recent incidents which have been occurring in the Strait of Hormuz which have involved shipping. As an island trading nation, we have a deep national interest in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the rules around freedom of navigation. It's an interest that we have at large in terms of all the high seas, and it's an interest that we have particularly in respect of this seaway, bearing in mind that Australia receives oil through that stretch of water and, indeed, sends trade through it in the other direction from Australia as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In supporting the mission that the government is participating in, the opposition has been mindful of Australia's history of participating in freedom of navigation operations around the world, particularly the longstanding contribution that has been made in that part of the world, largely by the contribution of a frigate to Operation Manitou. When the government announced on 21 August that it would be supporting this mission and announced that there would be the deployment of one P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft for a month at some point between now and the end of the year, it announced that there would be a reallocation of tasking for a six-month period of the frigate, which had been due to participate in Operation Manitou from January of next year. It also announced that there would be a contribution of staff to the headquarters of the international maritime security mission based in Bahrain. We agree that the scale of that contribution is appropriately calibrated to Australia's interest in this mission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, the government confirmed that Australia would be working with other countries and allies in dealing with this issueâin particular, the United States and the United Kingdom. It also made clear that Bahrain would be participating in this as well. But the government highlighted that there might be other countries which, in time, would participate in this mission. The government also said that there would be work around finalising the exact nature of the contribution that Australia would make to the command and control arrangements in the mission and in the headquarters. Noting that it has been a few weeks now since that announcement was made, we would be interested in hearing from the government whether other countries have confirmed their participation in this mission and what other details the government is able to provide in relation to the command and control arrangements in respect of the mission and the headquarters arrangements and other legal authorities for Australian forces in the operation of this mission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understood also from the remarks that were made by the Prime Minister when this announcement was made that this would be a time-limited mission. Time limits have been applied to it. We would like to understand the basis upon which any extension of that time may be considered and how that process may occur if it is being considered. We obviously appreciate there are sensitivities in respect of what can be made public in relation to this mission, and we're willing to take advice from the minister about what can be said in a public forum, but I think it's important that that information be provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, at the time of the announcement, urged the government and the Minister for Defence to make a statement to the parliament in respect of this mission. It is of course a matter for the executive government of the day to make decisions of this kind, but it is important that parliamentarians be given an opportunity to hear from the minister about these missions and also an opportunity to have their say. My question is in relation to whether there are other countries that are likely to participate, what the command and control arrangements are and whether there will be a statement made to parliament.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the government's defence budget, which represents a critical investment in a safer Australia, existing within a more secure region. This budget contains measures which are aligned with our national interests here at home whilst at the same time upholding the common values we share with our international partners and regional neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The flagship of these measures, the Integrated Investment Program, sets out more than $200 billion of investment in defence capabilities over the decade to 2028-29 which will deliver the capabilities outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Defence white paper</span>. I support the increases in funding to the defence budget in percentage of GDP terms, which I understand is on track to reach two per cent of GDP by the financial year 2020-21.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also commend the way our government have spoken about our intentions openly and honestly with our neighbours, partners and allies. This has contextualised our step-up and goes some way to ensuring our activities cannot be seen as belligerent or excessive. The Australian government has a clear vision to step up and enhance our Pacific family ties, based on shared values and a clear plan to work together to support a thriving Pacific community. As the Prime Minister has stated, Australia embraces our Pacific family, with whom we have special relationships and dutiesâour close neighbours, our major trading partners, our alliance partners and the world's fastest growing economies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Strategic Policy Institute wrote after the election of the Morrison government that our decision to appoint a double-hatted defence and foreign affairs portfolio minister for this initiative:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ puts the Morrison government in a strong position to be sincere and open in its engagement with the rest of the Pacific familyâ¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It further stated that:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of an Australia that is active in the Pacific and that walks the talk is of personal interest to me, having served as a platoon commander in East Timor, and a company second in command in the Solomon Islands for the Australian Army. My wife is also a former Australian Army officer. So as a family we have committed much of our lives to protecting Australia's interests in the Indo-Pacific and to supporting and working with our regional neighbours. I now welcome the opportunity that serving in this parliament provides me in contributing to the debate about our future role within the region. I also note that our government is strengthened by the fact that both our defence minister and assistant defence minister are also ex-service people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We collectively understand that we need a Defence Force which is agile enough to respond to emerging circumstances, equipped with the tools it needs to complete its missions, and capable of advancing our interests and building strong bilateral relationships with our closest neighbours. A key component of Australia stepping up in the Pacific and continuing to take engagement with our regional partners to the next level is the provision of 21 new Guardian class patrol boats to 12 Pacific Islands nations and Timor-Leste. The replacement of the Pacific patrol boats is an important part of the government's $2 billion 30-year commitment to the Pacific, under the Pacific Maritime Security Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding my comments and also to contextualise my question to the minister, I reflect on my own journey in this policy space so far. I've been tactically deployed at the forefront of our defence activities in our region, and I'm now contributing to the future direction of defence and foreign policy. So I can confirm, based on my lived experience and that of my former colleagues, that the Morrison government's priorities are absolutely right and that our investments in the Pacific will lead to a stronger and more secure Australia. In this context, I ask the following question of the minister: can the minister provide further details of how the defence budget is supporting the Pacific step-up?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  In large part, the area of veterans affairs and defence personnel is a bipartisan position across this chamber. The budget is, however, a very mixed bag for veterans. There are things I would applaud the minister for. We welcome the extension of the eligibility to the partner service pension, which has just passed parliament. We welcome the fact that the government have picked up the recommendations of the Labor initiated Senate inquiry on the use of antimalarial drugs in the Australian Defence Force, with assistance to veterans prescribed antimalarial medications, and we welcome the Australian Defence Veterans Covenant, which is a good Labor policy which government have picked up on. We thank them for that! </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a government in their third term, they seem oddly bereft of policy, and there seem to be significant failures in implementation and administration. One of those seems to be the area of the $40 million in cuts to allied health, through trialling a new treatment cycle initiative, where they got rid of the 12-month duration period and now require veterans to return to the GP every 12 sessions to seek another referral. This could mean that veterans are out of pocketâwith costs, rigmarole and inconveniences thereâand there could be gaps or delays in treatment. Minister, how does this fit with what you've been saying repeatedly in relation to this matter? Is this not just a cruel and callous cost-cutting exercise? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of stories about why this measure was introduced. One was that it was to save an IT system; another was that it was forced on the department by the Department of Health. What's the true story, Minister? DVA staff have confirmed this will result in veterans having access to fewer services, leading to worse health outcomes for veterans in the longer term. So Labor wants to know the policy rationale for this measure. This measure, of course, comes on top of the freeze in the Repatriation Medical Fee Schedule, which has already led to some reports of some medical and allied health professionals turning away DVA clients. The minister has recently acknowledged that more can be done to help veterans access the specialist health services they need in their own communities, particularly in regional and rural areas. Minister, what have you done in relation to this? You promised that you would fix this issue, but it doesn't seem that you've actually done anything. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the last election, Labor committed to rolling out seven veterans centres across the country. We're grateful that the government seems to have embraced our policy in relation to promising six veterans' wellbeing centres in the appropriation. It is disappointing, however, that the government has failed to match Labor's commitment to a centre in Ipswichâin my electorateâgiven the substantial number of defence and veterans' communities that are there and given the fact that in 2016 then Senator Barry O'Sullivan made a commitment for an Ipswich veterans recovery centre which was reported by <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Queensland Times</span>, and your predecessors have failed to take this up and implement such a policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's more than three months since the election, and a number of partners, such as the Queensland government and local federal MPs such as the members for Gilmore and Solomon, are crying out for greater certainty with respect to details of funding and implementation in relation to locations, time frames, staffing and cost. So, Minister, where are we up to in relation to that? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, what will be cut by the efficiency dividend of $1.8 million? I note the secretary of the department in July pointed out the need for extra staffing, and her agency has been hit by an efficiency dividend. What will go? I note the concern of the Community and Public Sector Union in relation to these cuts eroding the capacity of the department to deliver its function and not be funded properly. We need more staff in that department obviously in relation to the issue and that has been the response of the veterans community. We will work in a constructive and bipartisan way in relation to this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On defence personnel, there have been recent reportsâas recent as the weekendâin relation to feedback from psychologists highlighting the Department of Defence mismanagement of the new Defence healthcare contract with Bupa. Since Bupa took on the contract from Medibank on 1 July, a number of psychologists who have been treating Defence personnel have reported not being paid, which is affecting their ability to continue to see their clients, potentially harming their health service and putting lives at risk. Minister, can you advise what criteria were used in the tender process to select Bupa, and what due diligence did the Defence department undertake in awarding this contract, noting the well-publicised issues Bupa has had with aged-care homes? Can the minister advise what steps the department has undertaken since 1 July to manage this contract and rectify these delays in payment and referrals with Bupa?</span>

In response to the member for Corio, who has unfortunately had to leave, I'll just respond briefly. I can confirm the US and the UK commitment. I cannot comment any further on any other countries. It's a matter for other countries. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to his points about the command and control arrangements, there is no information at this time that I present to the House. Obviously, the Minister for Defence is keen to offer briefings in relation to this and has addressed this matter in the Senate. I'd encourage him to work with his counterpart to seek further information from the government in relation to the sensitive defence matters. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the member for Stirling's contribution, I want to thank himâin particular for his service to the ADF. We heard a little bit about that. When you think about the snapshot of his service, it is a metaphor for our entire defence cooperation in the regionâhaving served in Timor and Solomon Islands, having a spouse from Defence. It really does highlight and underscore the involvement of the ADF in the region over many years. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we had the state visit of Fiji's Prime Minister Bainimarama. It was a pleasure to welcome Mr Bainimarama to the Command and Staff College as he is a former student of the college. It also underscores the fact that the ADF served alongside members of the Fijian Military Forces as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands and as part of INTERFETâdeployed to the Middle Eastâand the ADF has proudly assisted Fiji with its deployment there. There are many other examples of defence cooperation with PNG, Tonga and elsewhere in the Pacific over a long and proud history. It's one of our highest foreign policy priorities, because it's where we live. As we know, the Prime Minister has indicated that through our step-up we take care of our family as the first priority of the Australian government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is undertaking a series of initiatives to deepen our engagement with the Pacific in defence and security cooperation, not least by elevating our relationships with countries like Fiji from very strongly existing bilateral relations to our 'vuvale' partnership, which has five pillars to it, including, importantly, security cooperation, but also through our elevation of the PNG relationship to a comprehensive and economic strategic partnership which will see great opportunity for enhanced security arrangements in the Pacific. We're seeing our Pacific partners work together to build a region that is sovereign, stable and secure, where partners in a Pacific future work together on regional security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recall our shared history with our Pacific neighbours as well. Speaking as a minister in the Defence portfolio, defence is critical in terms of the step-up because of that shared historyâour wartime history, our shared adversity and shared struggles that the Pacific has faced. Together, in times of trial, we've been magnificently served by our partner countries and the sacrifice and the service of their civilians, soldiers and people who have served with us and alongside our forces and supported us. We always recognise the contribution of Pacific countries in wartime endeavours with Australian Defence Force personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You'll see from our step-up more joint operations and more operational service between our two countries, in a bilateral sense, of PNG and Australia, and also with other countries in the region, including Fiji and other military forces. We also have a long history of providing humanitarian disaster relief in the Pacific. As we've said before, a dedicated humanitarian disaster relief vessel, a large-hulled vessel, will be in service to support increased engagement with our Pacific partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll reinforce the already strong alumni networks, keeping in mind the example of Prime Minister Bainimarama, who served in our staff and command college. In the security sector I'll be addressing the Pacific heads of security conference in the coming weeks, where we'll have all of the Pacific security heads in Brisbane to collaborate and work together on regional security issues, including important issues on the Prime Minister's priorities like combating the scourge of illegal fishing throughout our region. It's something we can do more on together and it's something that, through ADF cooperation, we will do more on. For the Pacific, their fisheries are the equivalent of the Australian mining and resource sector, and the scourge of illegal fishing is a high priority for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I've got remaining: Defence's role in the Pacific step-up is only one part of our broader commitment. On the people-to-people links, we've heard the member for Stirling's example of people who have had military service. The ADF has been deployed in the region for decades and has an exemplary record of service to the Pacific. We're proud of their contribution, we're proud of our shared future together and Australia will be stepping up under the Morrison government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  My questions relate to the lack of transparency under this government around defence capability acquisition sustainment. The first responsibility of any Australian government is to protect its people, and that requires a well-equipped and well-trained Defence Force with the resources it needs to defend Australia and advance its national interests. It means ensuring that Defence identifies, acquires and sustains the capabilities our military personnel need so that they can participate in operations abroad, work with Australia's partners, respond to disasters and humanitarian crises, and protect the sovereignty of our borders. We live in a period marked both by the emergence of new threats and risks and by the rapid evolution of defence capabilities and technologies. This strategic environment makes the delivery of capabilities needed by Defence all the more critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the opposition's point of view, there will be a bipartisan approach to the fundamentals of defence policy, but we will also hold the government of the day accountable. Labor has concerns about the level of transparency around the defence budget and defence investment plans. Defence is currently undertaking a $200 billion investment program, acquiring major new platforms across land, sea, air and key enabling capability streams. Yet the level of transparency around defence investment has declined markedly under this government. Let me give you some examples. Following the <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Defence white paper</span>, the government's budget paper estimated that Defence would spend $46.4 billion on its capital investment program over the four years from 2016-17. But analysis by ASPI of subsequent budget papers has shown that there's been a shortfall in capital investment of $5.17 billion over the four years from 2016-17 compared to the original estimates. No doubt there are a number of reasons for this, but the government has refused to explain this $5 billion cut in the defence budget. Let me repeat that: this government has cut $5 billion from the defence capital budget over the last few years without adequately explaining why it did so and what projects were impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is symptomatic of a larger transparency problem with the Integrated Investment Program. The IIP, which members opposite spoke about, was released publicly in 2016 to facilitate a whole-of-capability and a whole-of-life approach to capability acquisition and sustainment. This is an important mechanism to ensure defence planners adopt a more integrated approach to investment, to give industry greater visibility of future capability demands and to provide public accountability for the government's defence acquisition strategy. Yet, compared to its predecessor, the defence capability plan, the IIP provides very minimal details about individual projects. In the three years since it was released, there have been no public updates to reflect changes in the profiles or time lines of planned investments. This is despite a commitment by the government to issue regular online updates to the IIP. This is a matter for industry planning and public accountability. It defies belief that this government has spent $5 billion less than it planned to do, yet the IIP doesn't reflect this change in acquisition priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to a broader point. I and Labor have zero confidence that this government can provide appropriate oversight of major acquisitions in defence. Let's not forget that this is the party of the $1.4 billion Seasprite disaster. This is the party that oversaw, in government, the Wedgetail project delivered 6Â½ years late. This is the party that, when in government, signed a contract for the FFG upgrade that defied the laws of physics. And this is the party that, when in government, purchased landing craft for our amphibious ships that didn't actually fit into the ships. Let me repeat that: they bought landing craft that didn't fit into the amphibious ships. And they've shut down theâ</span>

                    </a>  They say we didn't build a ship. At least we didn't build a ship that didn't fit the landing craft. And they've shut down the Projects of Concern process. Australia is investing $200 billion in defence acquisitions, and we need to ensure this investment is actually delivered in a transparent manner, so my questions to the minister are: why did Defence underspend its original planned capital budget by a total of $5.17 billion over the four years from 2016-17? What projects have been delayed or cut as a result of this $5 billion cut? When will the government start issuing the regular updates it promised in relation to the Integrated Investment Plan? And, in 2015, Defence advised that bringing forward the OPV and the future frigates would lead to $6 billion of other projects being delayed. Can the minister identify those projects as well?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  The member for Shortland's contribution, if you could call it that, makes me so relieved that we are going to have a coalition in government. Here we have the opposition complaining about how procurement is done. When they were in government, they didn't know how to procure anything. Firstly, they've don't understand how to run an economy, which probably explains why they've don't understand how to run a defence force, which probably explainsâas he's leaving the chamber!âwhy the Labor Party did nothing in office but cut the defence budget. We have some heads crossing over there, so let me make it clear: in the year of the 2012-13 budget, Labor slashed the defence budget by over 10 per cent in real terms. That causes defence investment to fall by 1.56 per cent of GDP. The last time we had defence spending so low compared to that mob over there was 1938. That's the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm here to actually ask our minister an important question about the Land 400 program. This, of course, is part of a recapitalisation of Australian defence forces of over $200 billion. That's when you find procurement, by the way: when you actually run the economy and put real money behind our defence forces. The Land 400 program is close to my heart because I'm a Queenslander. We know that the Land 400 phase 2 project was won by a company called Rheinmetall, which has domiciled itself in Queensland. This was a $5.2 billion procurement spend on 211 combat reconnaissance vehiclesâthe best in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, if you go back to the basics of why we're all hereâat least why we should be hereâit is to keep our country safe and secure. Our soldiers deserve nothing but the best. Through the LAND 400 program, that is precisely what the priority is. The phase 2 contract was worth $5.2 billion. That is seeing over 1,400 jobs being created right across Australia. It is seeing not just jobs created, but careers. These careers are not just in the direct build of those combat reconnaissance vehicles but in over 40 Aussie businesses that are providing goods, parts and services to that work. We're talking about Australian steelâsteel that is now graded equally with the best coming out of Germany. This is more than jobs; this is careers. There are people in Australia who, without this sort of spend, would not have the careers they will now enjoy connected to the Australian Defence Force. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this project, you see projects being built. We heard a Labor Party member about 10 minutes ago complaining about spend in Ipswich. This $5.2 billion is being spent primarily through the production of combat reconnaissance vehicles at a site in Ipswich, in Queensland, and yet the Labor Party complain! I tell you what, if I were from Ipswich, I wouldn't be complaining about $5.2 billion. By the way, what I didn't say was that the Labor Party should also take account of the sustainment, the ongoing through-life support. Ipswich will benefit from that and so too will North Queensland. This is why it's so vitally important that we have these major projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the export pipeline, it's tens of billions of jobs. We have Australians getting onto the pipeline of those works, and we also export intellectual property which is now here in Australia. This is the birth of a new industry. This is jobs. This is small and medium businesses. This is economic prosperity, and it's also ensuring that our country is kept safe and secure and that our soldiers get nothing but the best. The coalition are the only parties that deliver that. That is why I'm happy to stand and ask the minister: what are the opportunities for Australian industry under the LAND 400 program, and how is this government supporting businesses, including small ones, to take advantage of these opportunities?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  My question will be to the Minister for Defence Industry. It goes to the issue of the workforce and skills challenges this nation faces. Just by way of background, and as opposed to some of the fictional stuff we've been hearing in relation to shipbuilding, for example: when Labor came to government in 2007 we discovered absolutely zero planning had been done for the replacement of the Collins submarine. To put that in context, the planning for the replacement of the Oberon began in 1978, and construction began in 1989. For the replacement of the Collins submarine, zero work had been done. No money had been spent on proper sustainment and maintenance of those vessels, so by 2007 we were very fortunate if we could get one boat in the water. We had to throw $700 million at that immediately to remediate the situation, to take us into a better space for deep-cycle maintenance to build the skills around hull cutting to enable us to have confidence to actually build the next generation of submarine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also didn't do any planning for the replacement of the supply vessels which became, effectively, above-water reefs that couldn't be deployed to support Australians in Cyclone Yasi, for example. What was done to remediate that was a billion dollars that we threw at building the skills in this country to enable us to support the air warfare destroyer and the landing helicopter dock projects. We also then started work on the submarine replacement. That included engaging in an extension-of-service-life program, which enabled us to understand that we could extend the life of the Collins, and looking at the MOTS options that were offshore, to give us the confidence we could do the job here without risking our personnel having something that was of a lower quality. We spent $266 million engaging in 85 contracts and activities to ensure that work could begin as soon as possible, settling on a son of Collins or evolving a new design project. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also made sure we'd selected the idea of a land based propulsion testing facility and down-selected the AN/BYG-1 combat system from the US so everything was ready to move into that next phase of submarine construction. So what happened? We then had the Abbott 'captain's pick' period, when he was all over the place. You can't hide from that. You know what happenedâlooking at Japanese options which were completely unsuitable for Australia, introducing inordinate delay in that whole submarine process. You know that's true, because Christopher Pyne had to come in and try and rescue this, only because of the political hurt that was developing in South Australia. We had a 'valley of death' created because of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had advice from the department to say that we could have built the supply vessels in Australia. They said in that advice that we could have been consolidating blocks by the first quarter of 2016. What did you do? You sent those vessels off to Spain to be built. Those are Australian jobs you've got over there in Spain. It should have been happening here. That alone would have fixed the 'valley of death' problem. If you just go out there and check your emails, you'll see Defence Connect asking serious questions about how you are going to meet these major projects of the Hunter class, the Attack class and Land 400 phases 1 and 2, which we actually had joined and you separated and delayed. First-pass approval for Land 400 phase 2 was going to happen in March 2014, under us. You made it very hard for Australian industry to be a part of those processes because of what you did with that project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the question that you will see Australian industry asking: what are you going to do about these high-end skills? That will need to be addressed not only by the defence industry process but by industry in general in Australia. This is at the same time as you've cut $3 billion from TAFEs and you've got rid of our SADI program, which delivered over 2,000 apprentices. You've replaced that with nothing. We have a skills crisis out there which you're not providing answers for. You've also cut research and development in this country by your failure to support that. We've dropped now to a rate of 1.8 per cent of GDP, when the OECD average is 2.38 per cent. In contrast, you see Israel putting 4.3 per cent into research and development and Sweden over three per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to know from you, Minister, is: precisely what modelling have you done on the skills and workforce that this country will need for these projects? What precisely are the numbers that will be required to fill these positions? What precisely is your plan to deliver on all of those jobs that are required to support these projects right across the spectrum? You have concertinaed them because you have delayed the decisions that we made when we were in government, so that they are now all going to meet in one big cluster in the middle, where you will not have an answer to provide those jobs. Industry know you don't have that answer, but they're crying out for it right now. What is the answer? Defence Connect have said that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to get together with the states for a comprehensive suite of policies to address this issue. What are they?</span>

This is just a general reminder that, under Labor's watch, not a single Australian-built ship was commissioned. We've heard this more than once today. We know that thousands of workers lost their jobs, creating that 'valley of death'. We know that $18 billion was cut from the Defence budget. There's no explanation as to why that happened.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House are investing more than $200 billion in the Australian defence industry, delivering more jobs and opportunities for small business. We announced as part of our <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Defence white paper </span>that an online version of the Integrated Investment Program will be delivered and made available to industry. This deals with the accusation of a lack of transparency. I just want to outline that we are committed to transparency for industry, and we've already released the <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Defence white paper</span>, the 2016 Integrated Investment Program, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence industry policy statement</span>, the National Shipbuilding Plan, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence industry and innovation program</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s update report</span>, the Defence Export Strategy and the Defence Industrial Capability Plan. So I suggest that my colleagues opposite might do a little bit of looking online to find more information before accusing us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very grateful to my friend and colleague the member for Fairfax for his contribution and for his question. The question relates to Land 400, which we are immensely proud of. Land 400 is a national endeavour to create jobs, back more small businesses and deliver the capability that the Australian Defence Force needs. It's worth repeating that, as part of the Morrison government's record investment of more than $200 billion in the Australian defence industry, we are spending more than $5 billion to deliver 211 combat reconnaissance vehicles, also known as the Boxer. As the member for Fairfax outlined, these will be manufactured in Queensland, a fact that I know he's particularly proud of. But there are Aussie workers and businesses right across the country that will play a part in that defence supply chain because our government is on the side of Australian workers and small business, creating new opportunities in the defence industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only one short month ago that I announced seven new businesses that will partner with Rheinmetall Australia to share in more than $20 million worth of work under Land 400 phase 2 and Land 121 phase 5B. These seven contracts are the initial contracts that are part of around $1.9 billion worth of work that will be undertaken by Australian industry. That's Australian small businesses employing Australians. Melbourne based Cablex will work on vehicle systems and cabling for the first 25 Boxer vehicles. Sydney based Eylex will work on crew communications equipment, including headsets for the first 25 Boxer vehicles. Melbourne based Tectonica will work on driver aids for night-time situational awareness for the first 25 Boxer vehicles. Brisbane based ABI Coating Specialists will paint and finish the first 25 Boxer vehicles. Ballarat based Bartlett will deliver tarpaulins for selected Rheinmetall high-mobility logistics vehicles. Adelaide based Supashock will deliver the spare wheel carriage system for Rheinmetall heavy transport vehicles. Newcastle based Varley will deliver various modules for the Rheinmetall high-mobility logistics vehicles. With the securing of this contract, 60 more jobs were created at Supashock's new facilities alone, and I was very pleased to attend the opening of their new fabulous facility. As a bit of a revhead myself, I was thrilled to be at Supashock and see all their great inventions and widgets. So hello to Supashock if you're out there.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, I attended DSEI in London, leading the largest Team Defence Australia delegation to showcase Aussie know-how and the strength of our defence industry. At DSEI it was my pleasure to announce Sydney based Thomas Global Systems' $15 million partnership with Rheinmetall Australia under Land 400 to deliver tactical training systems for the Boxer CRV.</span>

We need to expand access to defence industry for more businesses. We need to build Australia's skilled defence industry workforce and increase the number of exporting businesses. But only the Morrison government can be trusted to deliver more jobs and opportunities for small business and, in particular, defence industries.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I thank the minister and the member for Fairfax for the bit of a comedy routine that we've just had in the chamber. The only defence the government have to any of the questions that they are asked in this process seems to be to point back to their view about a government we had over six years ago. They're now on their third Prime Minister, so I can understand that they've forgotten that they've been in government for six years and need to take a degree of ownership for some of the things that are not working. I have to say that I thought it was particularly interesting when the minister referred to the Integrated Investment Program being updated and available online. It's true that the government's documentation for 2016 does talk about that. It's just that it hasn't actually happened. So, when the minister refers to that information, I would encourage her and ask her to please point us to the web link where we can find this updated information on the Integrated Investment Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the defence industry in particular, I do want to say that government decisions to require Australian industry content in our procurement processes for defence are a good thing. It's true that these sorts of decisions to procure locally can cost more in time and money, but over the long term they should pay dividends in terms of tailored capability for our defence needs and priorities, industry development, the creation of jobs, local sovereign capability creation and export potential. As I said, how we as a country are going to go about doing this is set out in the IIP. Unfortunately, as was referred to by the member for Shortland and others, we don't have the current information in respect of how that program is continuing, its spend and the delays that are occurring compared to what the government said would occur back in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was referenced earlier, ASPI has set out in its report on the cost of defence that it would appear that right now we have an underspend of the IIP, a shortfall that now totals over $5 billion since just 2016 and the release of the white paper. Critically this has meant the unfortunate situation where less than one per cent of the defence budget now goes into innovation funds. That must be increased. ASPI says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, less than 1% of Defenceâs budget goes into its innovation funds. That must be increased, and in a way that connects innovation to the large, well-funded programs in the IIP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say that, as set out in the IIP, they are well-funded programs. Expanding a mature defence industry will also provide manufacturing and employment opportunities to provide a ballast against swings and downturns in other industry sectors that are susceptible to global market conditions, thereby providing diversity and strengthening Australia's economy and better insulating it and its workers from global economic shocks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government should be working with industry across sectors to assist them in diversifying themselves into the defence industry supply chain, making the best of the innovations, research and development work that Australia already excels in that can have an application in defenceâareas such as the resource industry. I know the Minister for Defence Industry is very well acquainted with it. There's great skills development, innovation and research happening in those areas and others that could be brought to bear in defence, and government should work to assist that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence should also do more to make sure that defence industry in Australia is not merely shipbuilding labour hire. It should instead support the development of local sovereign design capability, developing our own intellectual property here in Australia to make sure that we are not just a shipbuilding labour hire country but one that is able to design its own capability, able to design ships in Australia and then also build them. An established defence industry sector will provide certainty of employment and training opportunities for the next generations of Australian skilled workers. But it shouldn't just be in the trades. It should be around design. It should be around those highly technical areas in which Australia could be building jobs for generations to come into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, defence capability procurement and sustainment decisions must be made in the national interest and not as a way of managing political footballs for the Senate crossbench. The question is: when is this government going to get serious about Australian industry content? When will it update the public on the progress of the Integrated Investment Program? What is it going to do about making sure we're not just a labour hire country when it comes to shipbuilding and that we are generating our own capability and design? When is it going to let us know? Minister, this is what I want to know: what are the requirements for AIC in the contracts that you have been letting, how are they being monitored and how are we enforcing that Australian industry content is actually happening in our defence procurement processes?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I'll be asking some questions shortly of the minister for veterans affairs. The minister for veterans affairs knows I'm very passionate about the issue of the care of our veterans. I have in my electorate of Fisher one of the largest veteran populations. In fact, when you combine Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay on the Sunshine Coast, we more than likely have one of the largest veteran populations. And why wouldn't you want to retire to the Sunshine Coast? But that's another question!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I'll be asking you a question shortly about transition to civilian life from the military. As the minister knows, I've never served in the military, but I have spent a lot of time over the last 3Â½ years working closely with members of the ADF in my role on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and also on the Public Works Committee. One of the common threads of concern that come through in relation to the care and welfare of our veterans is this very issue of transition to civilian life and how we as a government can make that transition better. We know that transition to civilian life is very, very closely aligned to three issues: one's physical health, one's mental health and one's employment prospects. Those three issues are absolutely intertwined. Arguably, it's difficult to get a job if you're not physically well, and it's difficult to get a job if you're not mentally well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that really sticks out to meâand I'm sure that the member for Herbert will back me up on thisâis that, when our ADF members are serving, they have a sense of mission. They have a sense of purpose, they have a sense of pride both in the job they're doing and in themselves, and they have a sense of tribe. They belong to the unit, and the unit that they belong to is so very, very important to them. When the time comes for them to transition from military life to civilian life, they lose all of that. They lose all of that sense of purpose, mission and tribe. In many ways, they are thrust into civilian life and they lose those things that are important to us all. Whilst, as I said, I have never served, I've spent a lot of time with members of the ADF, and, thankfully too, with the minister for veterans affairs in relation to the work he does with the ADF parliamentary program. It's given me an opportunity and an insight that I would never have had otherwise to see the life and the work of the men and women of the ADF and to get a greater understanding of that sense of tribe. It's given me a real insight into what it must be like to transition. Whilst I'm not pretending for a second that I fully understand it, I've got a glimpse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, on this side of the House, we talk about the best form of welfare being a job, and that applies to veterans as well. We have to provide for, and assist, veterans. We are doing some great work in this space, but there is always room for improvement. There's always room for improvement in enabling our veterans to have the dignity of being gainfully employed and to use the skills that they've worked so hard to get in the ADF. So we've got some work to do in relation to recognition of prior learning. Very importantly, what we need to understand is that not all veterans are broken. Whilst it's important that we talk about mental health, we've got to encourage employers to take on these ADF members. Can the minister advise what the government is doing to improve employment outcomes for veterans when they transition to civilian life?</span>

In addition to that, I note that a Productivity Commission report was released by the government on 4 July in relation to better support for veterans. I note the findings of that particular report that, although we spend $13.2 billion annually in relation to veterans and we service about 166,000 veterans, it's difficult for veterans to navigate the system, which is inequitable and overly complicated. Can the minister tell us when he will respond to that particular report?</span>

I thank him for his contribution. I undertake to the shadow minister that I will respond more fulsomely to the questions he has raised in relation to a whole series of issues. But I say to him, in particular in relation to the wellbeing centres, the federal government has committed $30 million for six new centres. I understand he has some interest in one in his own electorate; I would encourage him to write to me with some details of that proposal and certainly support him in his work to try and advocate on behalf of veterans in the Ipswich community. As I said, I will look forward to responding more fulsomely to the questions raised in the days and weeks ahead.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The appropriation bills support the delivery of core services and new measures across the portfolio, based around four key objectives: promoting fiscal sustainability, increasing productivity, securing the benefits of global economic integration and efficient administration of Treasury portfolio functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of headline figures, in the 2019-20 year the Australian Taxation Office will receive just over $3.6 billion of departmental funding to manage Australia's taxation and superannuation systems, including through helping people understand their rights and obligations, improving ease of compliance and access to benefits, and managing noncompliance with the law. In particular, the bills contain funding for the continuation of the corporate tax avoidance taskforce and, importantly, the expansion of single touch payroll.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of specific measures outlined in the 2019-20 budget, the bills provide $606.7 million over five years to facilitate the government's response to the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. This suite of measures fulfils the government's commitment to take action on all 76 of the recommendations in the royal commission's final report, including: $404.8 million over four years from 2019-20 in additional funding for ASIC to implement its new enforcement strategy and expand its capabilities and roles in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission; establishing a financial services reform taskforce in the Treasury to drive implementation of the government's response to the royal commission; and $30.7 million in 2019-20 to fund compensation owed to consumers and small businesses from legacy unpaid external dispute resolution determinations. They also provide $38.3 million over three years from 2019-20 to the Australian Bureau of Statistics to deliver, importantly, the 2021 census. More than $22.7 million over four years from 2019-20 is to be provided to the ACCC to continue and expand its work investigating wrongdoing in the commercial construction sector and to support the work of the Australian Energy Regulator in improving reliable and affordable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2019-20 budget also provided $11.7 million over four years to improve the Commonwealth Grant Commission's ICT capabilities, so that payments to the states can be managed in the most efficient and effective manner possible. This will complement our announced reforms to the GST, which, of course, will see a fairer and more sustainable GST deal for all states and, importantly, leave no state worse off. The government also provided $82.4 million over four years to the ATO as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs, to expand the single touch payroll system. This will ultimately reduce the compliance burden for employees and individuals reporting information to multiple government agencies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To paraphrase the PM: as politicians and public servants, we have a duty to do everything we can to serve the Australian people and nothing more. This applies as much to the Treasury portfolio, we acknowledge, as any other. In keeping with this mantra, these bills fund important consumer-centric measures including strengthening the food and grocery code, and examining the best way to create a superannuation consumer advocate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The appropriation bills Nos 1 and 2 implement these and many other important policies of the government ensuring that the four key objectives of the portfolio are met: fiscal sustainability, which I hope we'll hear a lot about today in consideration in detail; increasing productivity in line with the Treasurer's agenda, which he has spoken about very publicly; securing the benefits of global economic integrationâand we commend the work that the trade minister is doing to expand trade, including a bill which will come before the House very shortly which concludes the double tax treaty with Israel, an important trading ally; and the efficient administration of the Treasury portfolio, which is an obligation of all Treasury portfolio ministers.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I thank the assistant minister for his contribution, but, frankly, it's simply not good enough. This is the government's sixth budget, and what have they got to show for it? Debt is up; growth is down; wages are down; unemployment is going up; and productivity has absolutely flatlined. What's worse is that there is not a skerrick of a hint, not a scintilla of a hint, that the government has a plan to do anything about it. After six years of the Liberals, the economy has slowed substantially. The Australian people are struggling. Household confidence is down, household expenditure is down, and business confidence and business expenditure are down. We have 1.8 million Australians who are either out of work or underemployed. That's 1.8 million people who want to get a job or who have got a job but who are working one or two hours a week or maybe a couple of days a fortnight, not earning enough money to keep a roof over their head and food on the table, and certainly not enough money to meet their needs and aspirations. Growth is weak. We have not seen a level of growth as weak as this since the global financial crisis. With a set of numbers like that, not only would you expect to see a bit more energy from the assistant minister, but you'd like to see a bit more of a plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sixth budget since the infamous cuts budget of 2014. Say what you will about the Abbott government and the Turnbull governmentâand we had a fair bit to say about the woeful performance of both the Abbott government and the Turnbull governmentâbut both of them had a reason for being. Both of them, as misguided as they were, had some plans for the economy and some plans for the country. But what you have with this government, demonstrated in this budget, is an accidental prime minister and a surprise government with absolutely no plan to deal with the challenges that we are facing. We challenge the government to pick up some of the ideas that the opposition has been advocating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister likes to talk about his $100 billion infrastructure plan, but what he won't tell you is that over 70 per cent of this infrastructure plan is not due to be delivered within this budget period or the next budget period or the budget period after that. In fact, we have to wait four years for over 70 per cent of the infrastructure spending that the government likes to talk about. So I ask the Assistant Treasurer: why won't the government bring forward its spending? There are great projects in the Illawarra and on the south coast. I see the member for Gilmore here, and I'm sure she'd be very keen to know whether the Assistant Treasurer and the government are going to bring forward its announced spending on the upgrades of the Princes Highway. If the member for Cunningham were in the chamber, I'd ask about the Appin Road and Picton Road. And, in my own electorate, there is the Maldon-Dombarton rail link.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to ask the Assistant Treasurer if he could live on $280 a week. I will put my hand up and say that I couldn't. I know there is not a person in any of our major cities around the country that could afford to pay their rent and get themselves job ready, let alone jump on public transport and find their way into a job interview. So I ask the Assistant Treasurer: could he live on it, and will he back Labor's plan to sensibly review and increase the rate of Newstart? Have they got a plan to bring forward MYEFO and, as a part of that, bring forward the tax cuts that won't come into force until 2022? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Have they got a plan, and would they like to adopt Labor's plan, Labor's Australian investment guarantee? They can bring out the liquid paper and remove the name if they like, but we need a plan to get business investment going in this country. Without any alternative, they should adopt Labor's plan for 20 per cent instant tax write-off for investments over $20,000. There's a plan to get business investment going in this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  Well, surprise, surprise! The centrepiece of the shadow Assistant Treasurer's contribution is asking: 'Why won't the government bring forward spending?' Wasn't that the mantra of those opposite for six long years? They took the legacy of the Howard government, which was budget surpluses of $20 billionâaccumulated assets that the Commonwealth had of $80 billionâto debt and deficit of well over a quarter of a trillion dollars. Each year they promised a surplus but instead delivered a huge deficit. So it's no surprise that the centrepiece of the shadow Assistant Treasurer's question today is: 'Why won't the government bring forward spending?' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the shadow Assistant Treasurer: when we came to office we inherited a slowing economy, increasing unemployment and a terribly worsening budget position. In fact, the contribution referenced unemployment. Since this government has come to office we have supported the creation of 1.4 million jobsâand the shadow Assistant Treasurer refers to underemploymentâ75 per cent of which are full-time jobs. I'm very happy to compare that with the Labor Party's figures any time. Under Labor, employment growth was 0.7 per cent. Now it's 2.6 per cent. But apparently 2.6 per cent is not good enough for the shadow Assistant Treasurer. Heaven knows what he thought of 0.7 per cent when he was a member of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. In fact, we saw under Labor 62,000 small businesses shut their doors in their final year of office. In contrast, we've seen small business creations of at least 75,000. We believe that small businesses are the engine room of the economy. I say to the shadow Assistant Treasurer: you can't deliver surpluses like the Morrison government will deliver, if the answer to every question is: 'Why won't the government bring forward spending?' Because that seems to be the answer to every question from members opposite. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Assistant Treasurer refers to supporting tax cuts. Well, didn't the Labor Party get there kicking and screaming! We all saw the tortured process, presumably the arguments behind the closed doorsâwere they for them or were they against them? There were aspects of the tax cuts they 'could never support'. And then we see in the parliament finally a capitulation, after hearing speech after speech from members opposite criticising the tax cuts. I say to members opposite: those tax cuts, coalition tax cuts, have delivered into bank accounts some $15 billion of refunds to Australian people. That is $15 billion that is now in people's pockets, not in Treasury coffers. In the end, I think that is the great disparity between our two parties. We believe in the end that individual Australians can choose how to spend that money much more wisely than we can. And they will. We have every confidence they will. That is going to see a great improvement in sentiment, certainly in consumer confidence in this quarter, with $15 billionâand growingâhitting people's bank accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also say to the shadow Assistant Treasurer that, yes, delivering budget surpluses requires careful management of spending. But it also means you've got to close tax loopholes and make sure we don't have a rorted tax system, which is why we were so disappointed with your predecessor, who couldn't bring himself to support our multinational anti-avoidance laws when he was sitting in your seat. I say to the shadow Assistant Treasurer: you certainly don't have big shoes to fill in that regard. You can certainly break from the past and support the government. It's not just expenditure restraint but also ensuring we have a tax system with integrity, because, as a coalition, we believe in lower taxes. But we also believe in a system that's fair for everybody from individual taxpayers to small businesses, large businesses and multinationalsâwhom we welcome to this country provided they are willing to abide by our tax laws.</span>

I'd ask him to have a look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and perhaps come back to the principal chamber of the House, downstairs, and correct the record. Having said that, though, I don't take issue with the quality of his contribution, because it reflects the quality of the material he has to work withâwhich is pretty poor, as the member for Whitlam made clear. There is nothing to crow about when it comes to this government's economic record. Nothing demonstrates that quite so much as the behaviour of the government in this parliament, where they make clear that they are indeed the dog that caught the car. They are puffed up, having won the election, but, four months after having done so, have no plan for the economy and no plan for our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got a couple of questions that relate to the population aspect of the Treasury portfolio; population has recently been transferred out of Infrastructure and into Treasury. I think this is something that is worthy of some reflection, and I look forward to hearing about this from the minister and perhaps also, in time, from the Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure. It is interesting to examine the record of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, as it enters its seventh year, a third term, when it comes to cities and population policy. It took until 21 September 2015 for this government to recognise that our cities existed when it came to national policyâgreat engines of growth. Among the many critiques that the shadow Assistant Treasurer levelled at the government, he talked about the productivity challenge that the government is walking away from. If the government were serious about it, it would take our cities seriously as engines of productivity growth and it would look to meeting the infrastructure challenge. But, instead, the government has messed around with its responsibilities for infrastructure and cities at a ministerial level and also when it comes to machinery of government, with change after change after change, with the only constant being taking things off the Deputy Prime Ministerâand perhaps that's a matter that the minister at the table might respond to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm interested in particular in the Centre for Population, which has been created in the Commonwealth Department of the Treasury 'to help all levels of government better understand population changes in cities, towns, regions, states and territories'. Are these not substantially the same functions that the Abbott government axed when, in its first decision, it axed the Major Cities Unit in the then Department of Infrastructure and Transport? Does the minister accept that we have now gone full circle and have lost six years of vital data on our cities and what is happening within them? The minister, or perhaps the minister with direct responsibility for population, might also consider the government's policy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Planning for Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uture </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">opulation</span>, which states that the planning level of the Migration Program will be reduced from 190,000 places to 160,000 places for four years from 2019-20. But the 2019-20 budget paper states: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Population growth is assumed to average around 1.7 per cent per year over the forecast period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the minister is reducing permanent migration by a cumulative 120,000 over the forward period, will Australia's population growth remain an average 1.7 per cent? Perhaps the minister could deal with this directly. Clearly one of these two documents is wrong. Is it <span style="font-style:italic;">Planning for Australia's future population</span> or the budget papers? I look forward to hearing from him. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I note on the same issue that the government are planning to introduce new visas, which they've talked a lot about, to create, as they say, a stronger incentive for new migrants to settle outside the major capitals. This is, of course, a laudable objective if properly done. These measures are said to be designed to reduce pressure on Australia's major citiesâcities like Melbourne, as the Assistant Treasurer would be well aware. But a recent study by the University of Melbourne School of Population and Global Healthâa body relied upon to brief the Prime Minister and, I believe, COAG on these issuesâhas said that this is flawed logic and that, if labour demand remains strong in the large cities, firms unable to fill that demand from international migrants will instead draw upon on the rest of Australia. Minister and Minister Tudge, how will this measure, in fact, reduce congestion in our major capitals?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  Thank you, Assistant Treasurer. We're elected to parliament to represent hardworking, aspirational Australians and to ease the cost of living for families. Every day, millions of Australians rely on us to do the right thing by returning the budget to surplus, delivering more jobs, lowering taxes and guaranteeing essential services like Medicare, schools, hospitals and roads. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses make an enormous impact on the Australian economy. These businessesâlike Emu Plains Automotive Repairs and the Natural Choice CafÃ©âare run by local families who sacrifice and work long hours so they can employ local people, provide the services and products we need and keep our economy going strong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention small business a lot and for good reason. I have also owned and run my own small business. Australia has over 3.4 million small and medium businesses that support our economy. In Lindsay, I was proud to see that nearly 15,000 small and medium-sized businesses have benefited from our legislated tax relief and that over 14,800 are benefiting from our instant asset write-off scheme. By 2021-22, small and medium-sized businesses will be paying lower taxes at a rate of 25 per cent, and this is because the Morrison government has a strong budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also proud that during my first week in parliament, the Morrison government delivered tax relief to over 10 million Australians on low to middle incomes. In my seat of Lindsay, that's nearly 77,000 people who benefited from these tax relief measures. By 2024-25, 94 per cent of Australians will face a marginal tax rate of no higher than 30c in the dollar. These measures are made possible only when you have a government that can manage the economy, a government whose priority is to ease the cost of living for Australians and a government who can manage a strong budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making sure that all Australians have access to affordable health care. We have guaranteed Medicare, nearly nine out of 10 GP services are bulk-billed and we're listing medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Earlier this month I took the Minister for Health to visit High Street Medical Imaging, a local MRI clinic. Earlier this year they were provided with an MRI licence, which means that people in Lindsay will be able to access a Medicare rebate for an estimated 3,719 services a year. This can only be done because of the Morrison government's ability to manage a strong budget. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our kids need to be prepared for the jobs of the future, and we're delivering $292 million from 2019 to 2029 to Australian schools. I recently visited Jamison High School with the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, where we saw their STEM programs. We launched the STEM toolkit for young women who want to get into STEM and want to see what their career choices may be. Our funding is working to deliver these programs. The Minister for Education and I visited Samuel Terry Public School, where we again saw young Australians invested in STEM and working with programs in robotics and maths. By making sure young Australians have the opportunity to gain the skills needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow, we're ensuring that investing in industries and new and exciting technologies will create more jobs so that more young people will be able to be employed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Sydney, the investment in the airport and the aerotropolis, along with the Sydney science hub, will create thousands of direct and indirect jobs. We can do this only because the Morrison government can manage a strong budget. We're committed to delivering tax relief, investing in the skills of young Australians and creating local jobs. In Western Sydney alone, the Western Sydney City Deal will create 200,000 jobs. There's a growing need for skilled workers, especially in my electorate of Lindsay. That's why I recently launched the Lindsay jobs of the future forum with the Minister for Education. We want to encourage more young people into STEM and into those jobs of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're on the side of hardworking, aspirational Australians. We are backing our small businesses. We lowered taxes so they can pursue opportunities to grow and better serve our communities. We're backing aspirational Australians striving to get ahead and to be part of emerging industries and the jobs of the future. Unlike the Labor Party, we don't want to hold back Australian families working harder. We don't want to hold back our small businesses with higher taxes and complicated bureaucracy. We are delivering lower taxes, we're creating more jobs and I'm proud to say we're backing the 3.4 million small businesses in Australia and almost 15,000 in Lindsay. Will the minister inform the chamber how the Morrison government is supporting hardworking Australians and small and medium-sized businesses across Australia by providing smaller, simpler, fairer and lower taxes?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  We have just learned that Joe Isaac, one of the pre-eminent postwar economists in Australia's history has passed away. His work is highly relevant to the issues we're discussing today. I want to take a moment to pay tribute to the late, great Joe Isaac. He was born on 11 March in 1922 in Penang. His family moved to Java soon after he was born and his early education was in Dutch. His family was evacuated to Perth at the time of the Japanese invasion. He then went on to study at Queen's College, where my grandfather Keith Leigh and Max Corden also got their education. He went on to do his PhD at the London School of Economics, where he studied with Coase, Hayek, Tawney, Laksi and his supervisor, Phelps Brown.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He taught at Melbourne and Monash universities, finding, as he said, academic life in the 1950s and 1960s 'leisurely and enjoyable'. He noted there was a strong tension between the Melbourne and Monash universities at the time, but it's a tribute to Joe Isaac that in 2010 the two universities established the annual Joe Isaac workshop and symposium, collaborating with this man who had served in both departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He was appointed deputy president of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1974, the first economist to be so appointed. Keith Hancock was the subsequent economist, and the organisation has continued to have an economist on the panel ever since.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a true internationalist. Joe Isaac was engaged by the International Labour Organization to advise the government of Ghana and by the Employers Federation of Fiji. He was commissioned by the Australian government to report on wages and trade union matters in Papua New Guinea and advised the government of Indonesia, taking advantage of his early upbringing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a well-published scholar, publishing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Economics</span> 'The function of wage policy: the Australian experience' in 1958. In his Foenander lecture in 2006, he warned of the overreach of the Work Choices legislation. He pointed out the importance of fairness in industrial relations, drawing on the work of the new Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, and pointed to the important research on the link between inequality and health and the risk that, if we allow wage inequality to get out of control, it can have an impact on poverty and disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He had worked on the issue of the real wage overhang in the 1970s, but it was only last year, at the age of 96, that he published a paper in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Economic Review</span> titled 'Why are Australian wages lagging and what can be done about it?' It's written by a 96-year-old but it could not be more timely to the issues we're discussing today. Joe Isaac pointed out that the bargaining power of organised labour has been weakened in a large section of the labour market. He noted that the rise of fragile work, such as part-time and casual employment, and the rise of gig economy services has placed pressure on the bargaining power of employees. He pointed to the challenge of sham contracting and to legislative changes that had affected entry rights for workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He noted work by Jim Sanford that the number of collective agreements had fallen by about 40 per cent in the last four years. He noted a bevy of changes that had been made to the rights of workers which had been accompanied by a significant decline in the unionisation rate. He pointed to the breaches that had occurred in employment conditions: exploitation of immigrant workers, underpayment of 7-Eleven employees and the nonpayment of penalty rates for hotel housekeepers. The lack of inspection of pay records, he said, went straight to the heart of this. As Joe Isaac concluded in his paper just a year ago, 'Slow wages growth in recent years has been associated with the significant change in the distribution of income in favour of high-income earners.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A core challenge for Australia today is the challenge that Joe Isaac worked on throughout his long and distinguished career: how do we get wages growth going in Australia? We currently have an unemployment rate that is a full percentage point higher than in Britain, New Zealand, Germany or the United States. We have a government that is failing to act on the core issues in the labour market that Joe Isaac devoted his career to. Engaging the government on the issue of wages must be at the heart of getting productivity, wages and egalitarianism in this country going again.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I thank my good friend the member for Lindsay in particular for her contribution and question. She is absolutely the embodiment of her electorate, which is in turn the embodiment of aspiration. The member referred to aspiration on a number of occasions during her contribution and question, and rightly so. I was very pleased to visit the member for Lindsay shortly after the election result, and we had the opportunity to see some of the fruits of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, which of course the member for Lindsay understands better than almost anybody in this House, given her history working in community housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member asks: what is the Morrison government doing to provide aspirational and hardworking Australians and small businesses with simpler, fairer and lower taxes? What a wonderful question it is. The Morrison government has delivered the most significant changes, certainly to personal income tax, that we have seen in a generation. Again, one of the great contrasts between our two parties is our absolute belief that the hard-earned money of Australians is better off in their pockets than in Treasury coffers. Our personal income tax plan, which is being conducted in three significant steps over seven years, is doing just that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, as I alluded to earlier today, we have delivered immediate relief of up to $1,080 to more than 10 million Australians. That has resulted to date in $15 billion hitting people's bank accounts in tax refunds. A large proportion of that $1,080 is in the form of the low- and middle-income tax offset. Secondly, we are doing what few governments have done in our history. Yes, we are taking a leaf from the outstanding Howard government in protecting against bracket creep and saving Australians thousands and thousands of dollars. I know on this side of the House we believe intuitively that it is only fair to give back bracket creep. Of course it is always left to coalition governments in the mould of the Howard and Costello government to do just that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdlyâand really the trifecta of one of the most significant changes to the personal income tax system that many of us will have seen in our lifetimesâwe are ensuring, as the member for Lindsay articulately put it, that 94 per cent of Australians will not face a marginal tax rate greater than 30c in the dollar. That means we're abolishing the existing 37 per cent tax rate, and then at the end of our plan the 32.5c rate gets reduced to 30c in the dollar. This will boost aggregate household income by $8 billion each year for the next four years. And it's obvious that, in entrusting Australian consumers with a bit more of their own money, that confidence will flow into the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lindsay has also spoken, not just on this occasion but time and time again, about small business, and we are absolutely dedicated to supporting small business. It's the engine room of growth in the economy. It's no accident that a government that has presided over 1.4 million new jobs, 75 per cent of which are full time, is a government which since day one has said, 'We are backing small business, who are the engine room of jobs growth in our country.' Small and medium-sized businesses have already received a significant tax cut to 27Â½ per cent. That will then drop to 26 per cent by 2021 and to 25 per cent, when all is said and done, by 2021-22. And what better way for the governmentâwhat better way for any budgetâto provide for tax expenditures to small and medium businesses. We've also done that in a range of measures including the instant asset write-off and by increasing the threshold at which we consider a business to be a small or medium enterprise, for many purposes, to a turnover of up to $50 million. That has ensured that businesses that might have high turnovers but operate on very, very slim margins and are small businesses under any definition will get the benefit of not just these tax cuts but the instant asset write-off and so many other initiatives of this government. I thank the member for Lindsay for her eloquent contribution.</span>

                    <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  In framing the questions that I have of the government and of the assistant minister present, I'm going to pose a couple of tests for this government, and I'll argue they're not doing very well on either count. The first is what I'm calling the 'professor test' and that is measuring economic performance against some of the very well-known economic measures that we talk about in the newspapers. The first of these is productivity growth. We are enduring at the moment the worst period of productivity growth since the recession of the early 1990s, and I might add that we are enduring this productivity growth malaise at a time when there are no microeconomic reform ideas on the horizon. Second, we are experiencing a time when the national accounts are at their lowest level of growth for 18 years. GDP per capita is now lower than it was a year ago. Let's look at CapEx. In June 2019, it was 21 per cent lower than six years prior in June 2013. Business investment is now at its lowest level since the 1990s recession. What about wages as a share of national income? In 2013, 53.2 per cent of total income in Australia went to wages; under this government, that figure has now fallen to 51.7 per centâthe lowest level since 1965.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA is calling out for microeconomic reform, for infrastructure investment and for fiscal policy to do more of the heavy lifting. The Reserve Bank governor has said that structural reforms are probably the best lever, and he goes on to discuss the potential there. He also talks about how we can do more on infrastructure, and, pointedly, says that monetary policy is not the country's only option. There are certain downsides from relying too much on monetary policy. And what do we get from the government? What we get from the government is the Prime Minister in question time going through the Reserve Bank governor's testimony with a fine toothcomb to quote him out of context, when he says that it's not his job to define the precise parameters of fiscal policy. But what he's clearly saying time and time again is that we need to do more with infrastructure and we need to do more with fiscal policy. So this government fails the professor test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the pub test? Are people better off? Real wages growth has been glacial, averaging just 0.2 per cent per annum over the last six years. Wages are growing at one-sixth the pace of profits. Households are feeling the pinch, and the price of energy, gas, electricity and child care are going through the roof. How has this manifested? The ANZ consumer confidence index has plummeted, falling by 3.5 per cent to a two-year low last year. Future economic conditions expectations declined by a sharp 7.6 per cent. And what is the government's response? In question time, what did we hear from the Prime Minister and from the Treasurer? They said to people out there who are using the pub test: 'Don't worry about wages growth. Don't worry about the WPI'âthis great euphemism, as we hear from the Treasurer. 'Don't worry, because it was 0.5 per cent last quarter and, if we rewind 6Â½ years, it was 0.4 per cent in that one quarter.' So he's fishing through the data. 'It was 0.5 per cent from a quarter we picked in our term and 0.4 per cent in some quarter we picked from the last government's term, so don't worry out there in the community. It's all okay. Zero point five is higher than 0.4. Don't worry about your childcare costs. Don't worry about energy. Zero point five is bigger than 0.4.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look at a better measure. Let's look at total increase in WPI during this government: 13.7 per cent from September 2013 to June 2019. Let's look at total increase in WPI during the previous government: 19.7 per cent from December 2007 to June 2013. Let's not pick a quarter here or there. Let's look at those six-year periods. It was significantly higher under Labor. In light of that fact, this government fails the professor test and the pub test. Coincidentally, I believe those two wise tests are two sides of the same coin, because they're really about how you raise living standards in a sustainable way. It's about productivity leading to higher living standards and wages growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the assistant minister: does he believe that consumer confidence is falling through the floor because consumers are finding that wages aren't keeping up with the cost of living, or does he think it's because consumers are concerned about macroeconomic management incompetence by this government? Secondly: when will the government heed the calls from the RBA, and from economic experts more broadly, to look at more than just the surplus and develop a broader economic plan that includes structural reform and infrastructure investment and will lead to wages growth? When will the government heed all these experts' calls?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I cannot miss this opportunity to reflect on the member for Fraser's speech. There is one test we passed, and that's the electoral test. You can stand here and come up with as many dummy tests as you like, but the one that matters we passed. The reason we passed it is that we are not allowing the member for Gungahlin to come in here and say to us that wages have stagnated under this government, because they have not. Joe Isaac might have written at the age of 96 that he thinks that, but the fact of the matter is that, if you are in the bottom 20 per cent, the bottom quintile, of income earners in Australia, your wages have gone up 11 per cent under this government. If you're in the next income group, they've gone up seven per cent. If you're in the top group, they've only gone up 3.2 per cent, and they've gone up 2.4 per cent in the group after that. In fact, income inequality is at a record low under this government. So we will not be lectured by those opposite about income inequality, because, under them, it got worse. Under us, it's getting much, much better. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Joe Isaac can talk as long as he wants about this sort of stuff, but the fact of the matter is that we have one of the best, most targeted welfare systems in the world: $172 billion every year is spent on welfare. If you are in the bottom 20 per cent of income earners, for every dollar you pay in tax, the benefit you receive from the government is 900 times higher than that of someone in the top 20 per cent. Our income redistribution system is 29 times more redistributive than the United States, 19 times more redistributive than France and 17 times more redistributive than the Nordic countries on average.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to the assistant minister: you brought down an extraordinary budget in April; it brought forward $100 billion in infrastructure spending over 10 years. Allow me to say what that means to the people of Mackellar. I live on the northern beaches, which is one of the most beautiful areas in Australia, and Australia is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. We are incredibly lucky. But it is not good enough, because we are punished with three of the 10 most congested roads in all of Australia. Warringah Road is the third-most congested road in all of Australia.</span>

                    </a>  I'm glad you have brought that up. You'll regret that. This government is bringing $100 billion to bust congestion. The New South Wales state government is spending $124 billion on transport. Why did this problem happen? Let me think. There was this Labor Premier called Bob Carr. He told everyone to go away from Sydney. Then Kevin Rudd, the Labor Prime Minister, said, 'We're going to increase the immigration intake by 400,000 people.' And then you had Kristina Keneally, most of whose cabinet are now held somewhere at her majesty's pleasure, I understand. So there wasn't a lot going on in the 16 years of the Labor Party. Then, of course, we managed to do a lotâ</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  Eliminating poverty must be central to the work of this place. Many in Labor are looking to what will be our shared driving force over the next three years, given the decision of the Australian people in May. The Leader of the Opposition rightly said that Labor's policies may change but our values do not. Those values of opportunity, fairness and equality mean nothing if, in this place in this term, we do nothing to address the huge poverty challenges that this country faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Poverty alleviation is a cause which is carried through from Labor's earliest roots in the traditional pre-Federation trade union movement to one of the first policy achievements of a Labor government: the age pension. This cause solidifies Labor's unique position as an intervener with purpose in the market economy. It was this view and these values which led us to extend the pension to women in 1908 and to increase the pension a century later under Prime Minister Rudd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our public debate, Australians have talked much of inequality, but these conversations focus far too often on redistribution. In recent times, this had led our focus to be on conversations about people who are perceived as having too much, rather than what our focus should be on, which is those who do not have enough to survive. I'm always fond of the words of John Curtin, which he said on 28 August 1940 during one of his campaign speeches:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Labor is a peace-loving party. Its struggle has always on behalf of the weak against the strong; for the poor, for those who never had a chance â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we think about some of the debates we have in this place around economic policy, it's worth remembering who it is we are actually here to serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, there are simply too many people who do not have enough to get by. The Australian Council of Social Service estimates there are some three million Australians who live below the poverty line. This is a dramatic figure. Three million of our fellow Australians are without enough to have what we would call that basic experience of being able to fully participate in our society. This has a worse impact than on our schools than it does anywhere else. The Smith Family calculates that there are some 1.1 million children living in households that are below the poverty line. That is 1.1 million children whose families cannot provide the basics and the essentials for them to perform at their absolute best during their schooling years. In a shocking statistic, Foodbank has partnered with 500 New South Wales government schools to provide free breakfasts for children who would otherwise go without.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the poverty debate, some will say that Bob Hawke's famous campaign pledge that 'by 1990, no Australian child will be living in poverty' set the cause of poverty eradication back. I disagree. There is nothing wrong with having big policy goals and an aspiration for a greater Australia, especially when those policy goals cannot be achieved by one single policy, one single payment or one single legislative measure. This year, as we celebrated Bob Hawke's life, it became clearer and clearer that the policies he stitched together, indeed, did lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got to avoid the trap of fighting social causes and economic causes separately. The reality is the best social policy is also economic policy. This is true of paid parental leave, true of the Modern Slavery Actâa great achievement of the current governmentâand true of the Equal Opportunity Act, to name just three. Each of them lifted people out of poverty and were concrete steps towards avoiding a working poor in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians expect us to put the voters first. That means talking about people and their lived experience, not just about institutions, mechanisms and payments. It means engaging with the most vulnerable Australians, and ensuring government support is at a sufficient level. It means doing basic things that make those essential building blocks available for allâthings such as making child care affordable for all Australians and accessible for all children. It means taking action on the pain caused by inadequate unemployment support. I believe this is one of the most pressing tasks of the 46th Parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever your political persuasions, unemployment is a cost to society. It costs society in lost tax revenue, it costs us in lost productive labour and, most importantly, it costs us in terms of lost hope for a person who is unable to fulfil their potential. The calls for Newstart to increase will continue to become louder and louder until they become unavoidable for whoever is in government. We should also make sure that when Newstart reform is finally achieved the one-payment-fits-all approach is put in the bin for good. We should make sure these payments actually achieve their stated policy goal. If our policy goal is to make sure that people have a decent standard of living when they cannot get a job, then by logic Newstart is too low because people cannot have a decent standard of living when they are unable to find employment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first step for someâthose even less fortunateâin lifting them out of poverty is to make sure they simply have a roof to sleep under. In my state of Western Australia, the sluggish economy has meant more and more Western Australians are experiencing homelessness. Recently released data shows that in the year 2017-18 specialist homelessness services in Western Australia assisted some 23,739 people. That is 23,739 Western Australians relying on services because they did not have somewhere to call home. That shows the more-quoted statisticâof some 9,000 Western Australians experiencing homelessness on census nightâin a different light; it shows that we really do have a huge problem in Western Australia when it comes to homelessness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited Tom Fisher House, run by St Vincent de Paul. St Vinnies do an amazing job both in their fundraising and in their purpose based community work. I visited with the shadow minister for housing and homelessness, the member for Blaxland. These people are at the coalface of homelessness. Their services are full every single night. We can't just put a positive spin when it comes to homelessness. We need to make sure there's funding for the sorts of services that we've seen actually make a difference. One of them is the Common Ground model. It has been a success in Brisbane and in many other states. Unfortunately, during the global financial crisis, funding was not provided for Western Australia to receive one of those services. I believe it is time that the federal government now funds that service in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about things like appropriations in the budget in this placeâas we just haveâwe often use language like 'our budget'âand I hear this far too often. We say: 'Our budget will do this. Our budget will do that.' It's not an abstract thing that is owned by someone. It is actually the community's aspirations represented in a government document. It is the same when we talk about inequalityârather than discussing the very real human impacts of living below the poverty line. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is one example where we talked about lifting people out of poverty in a way that truly transformed people's lives. It was about lifting those families and individuals living with disability out of povertyâsome for the first time. It's been an amazing achievement and one of those things that will last in this country longer than any of us will serve in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Labor side, we've always fought for those who do not have the circumstances, means or power to protect their own circumstances or their own economic situation. It's one of the reasons that I'm a strong supporter of Australia's foreign aid target of 0.5 per cent of gross national income becoming the standard by which we measure whether or not we are doing our bit as good international citizens across the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lifting people out of poverty has driven some of the greatest Australians to serve in this parliament. You cannot read one speech by John Curtin where he doesn't talk passionately and clearly about lifting Australians out of poverty and building a society where poverty does not exist. Even in the depths of World War II, it was his single focus about the sort of country he wanted to build at the conclusion of the war. In the face of that war, he was able to increase pensions twice in just five years. And for the first time, with federal government funds, they were able to fund creches for women who had entered the workforce for the first time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complex policy area. There, are no simple solutions. There is no one single policy, but a stitching together of many policies that will hopefully allow all of us in this place to achieve our goal of lifting our fellow Australians out of poverty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  It's always a pleasure to rise in this place and speak about some of the great community organisations and events that go on in our electorates. So, rather than being a grievance tonight, it's about the positive stuff that we as all parliamentarians in this place do. One of the rewarding aspects of the job is coming home to our electorates and being with our community, attending those charity fundraisers, those football matches and the various community events across our electorates. In Forde, it's no different. It's been a busy month with fun-filled events happening across the electorate during the winter break.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I had the pleasure of attending the 25th anniversary of the Jimbelunga Nursing Centre in Eagleby. For over 25 years, Jimbelunga has provided culturally appropriate, quality aged care to its residents, many of whom come from an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background. Equally, and what's so pleasing, is the wide variety of cultures that enjoy life now at Jimbelunga. Jimbelunga has an enduring legacy within the Eagleby community, and I wish to congratulate the residents, staff and their families on this wonderful achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the opportunity to visit the Beenleigh Baptist Church MESH group in Seniors Week. MESH stands for meet, engage, share and heal. It's just one of many groups in my community that are encouraging senior Australians to remain active and socially engaged in our community. I want to thank Glenda Dutton for inviting me and I thank Pastor Steve for the wonderful prayers for our country and for our leaders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ormeau Progress Association also hosted their annual Ormeau Seniors Expo recently. It was great to see so many locals come down, attend and take advantage of the great exhibitors and information that was available. I want to thank Judy Hendrikx from the Ormeau Progress Association for another outstanding expo and also thank all the exhibitors who took part and made it such a successful day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the pleasureâand it's one of the great roles and responsibilities in our jobâto present some Australian flags to some local schools and to childcare centres in my electorate, including Kingdom Kids childcare centre at Carbrook, Eagleby Kids Early Learning Centre, My Little Place at Eagleby and the Cedar Creek State School. The students were all very appreciative of the flags and showed great pride in flying them at their centres and schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Norfolk Village State School also celebrated their annual Grandparents Day, which continues to enjoy strong support from grandparents, and a record number of grandies were in attendance. I want to thank the staff for organising such a terrific event, and I look forward to next year's event being bigger and better than this year's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were even more celebrations at Twin Rivers Community Mallet Sports Club, which celebrated its ninth birthday. I had the pleasure of celebrating with the club as it continues to grow every day. Sadly, we recently lost the founder of Twin Rivers Community Mallet Sports Club, Des Schodel, and I spoke at length in this place last week about Des's contribution, not only to the club but to the broader community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Budgerigar Society hosted their 62nd annual show at their clubhouse in Beenleigh. It was a great event, with competitors coming from clubs across the state, and the bird puns were flying all over the place. The team at the budgie society always have so much fun. It's interesting, having been taught a little bit about judging the budgerigars, to see how much actually goes into it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forde also celebrated the sporting achievements of our youth, with the awarding of Local Sporting Champions grants. Sporting champions such as Khiani Dodd, who will represent Australia in the New Zealand interprovincial championships and Trans Tasman Test Series, or Brooke Stewart, who is competing in the 2019 under-19 Women's Softball World Cup in the United States. These are just some of the amazing sporting champions in the electorate of Forde, and I wish them and all the other recipients of Local Sporting Champions grants all the best for their contributions in the fields in which they play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the opportunity to visit Triple M Holdings during National Skills Week and spoke with Grace Seagrove, an engineering and electrical apprentice who is benefiting from great vocational education and training whilst getting real work experience and skills at a local business. I know from previous visits to Triple M Holdings that they have had a number of local apprentices over the years who have gone on to higher roles with more responsibility within the organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also visited Eagleby South State School with our special guest, Borobi, to see the amazing work the school is doing in engaging our youth and teaching them Yugambeh, the local Indigenous language. For those here, Borobi will be in the House tomorrow for a launch of a new book. Teaching our kids Indigenous languages only enriches our culture and gives our kids a better understanding of where we have come from and where they are headed in the future. I want to acknowledge the Yugambeh museum's role in reviving Indigenous language. I especially acknowledge Rory O'Connor, the CEO, and his team for taking the time to come and visit the kids at Eagleby South State School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also hosted the first NBN seniors information session at the Beenleigh senior citizens centre, which was well attended with over 100 constituents present. I want to thank NBN community ambassador Kier for his wonderful presentation on what the NBN will mean to our seniors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Logan Small Business Expo was also in its third year and I'm pleased to report that over 175 small businesses participatedâup from last yearâand over 900 people attended, an increase of some 200. More importantly, 27 start-up businesses exhibited for the first time at the show, which goes to show that the government's plan for small business is working. It is creating an environment which fosters business growth, innovation and deployment of new technologies, especially in the city of Logan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The annual Paddock to Plate lunch at the Beenleigh State High School was another crowd-pleaser. This event gives students the opportunity to work with renowned chef Matt Golinski, use their creative talents and create some amazing dishes for the guests. Once again, it was a sell-out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, the children of Forde were asked to nominate their fathers for my Forde's Fantastic Fathers award. This award recognises the outstanding contribution of fathers and the impact they can have on their families and children. We received over 50 nominations from children across the electorate, and it was truly humbling to read their nominations and the wonderful stories they mentioned. I wish to acknowledge and congratulate all the fathers nominated for all that they have done for their families. But, in the end, there could only be one winner, and I was proud to present the award to Ryan, a local father in Eagleby who moved from Wales to Queensland for the terrific weather and, happily, found love here as well. His nomination stood out to me because a father doesn't necessarily have to be somebody who is forced by DNA to be in that role; it can be someone who fathers a child because they genuinely want to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also took the opportunity to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the St Philomena School at Park Ridge, at their community fair. We celebrated the school's evolution from humble beginnings in 1999 to a promising prep-to-year 12 educational institution with 231 students. I want to thank the P&amp;F committee for their tireless efforts in organising this event. The Beenleigh Baptist Church also hosted a spring fair, with lots of entertainment and activities for the kids. There were also a number of multicultural food options. Whilst I wasn't brave enough to try the spicy African chicken, I did have a bite of the continental goulash, which was fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Logan Country Chamber of Commerce hosted the inaugural Village Fest on the Logan Village Green, featuring The Choirboys. It was a wonderful event, with over 1,400 attendeesâall rocking along to the greatness that is The Choirboys and many other great local bands. I commend the chamber on this Logan-first event, and I look forward to next year's event being even bigger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Lighthouse Care, a local food relief organisation in Loganholme, recently held their annual fundraiser at the Logan Entertainment Centre. I was proud to continue to support Ron and Debbie and their team at Lighthouse, who continue to provide support to over 500,000 people each year by providing affordable grocery items and support to those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community of Forde is a wonderful community, full of individuals and groups of people who never fail to come together to lend a hand to help one another. I look forward to continuing to support them over my coming term.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  It took me a few days to work out why there were so many water tanks on some roofs and not others. In Palestinian cities like Ramallah, I would stand and look out over high rises and houses to see a 'black forest' of water tanks. While we were driving I could see past high fences to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank where new houses stood, apparently connected to mains water supply with no water tanks to be seen. As a naive Australian, I wondered whether some were just better at collecting rainwater than others. No; the water supply to the settlements is constant, we were told. But it is intermittent to the Palestinian towns, so they pump water up into the tanks when they can to save it for another day. Palestinians have access to about 73 litres of water per person per dayâfar less than the World Health Organization-recommended 100 litres per dayâwhile the settlers consume four times this amount, at 300 litres per day. These statistics are getting worse by the year. It's not a healthy way to live, nor is it fair. Water is essential for life. But, for the Palestinians, control over waterâlike almost everything elseâis not in their hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate enough to visit Palestine, Israel, Kuwait and Jordan earlier this year, together with a number of other MPs from this parliament. From the Palestinians, time after time, we heard a simple refrainâfrom the brewer who couldn't export her beer, because it was routinely stopped at checkpoints, to the universities that had students who couldn't get to classes on time for the same reason: 'End the occupation, leave us alone to run our lives and we will build a viable country.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also met many Israelis fighting Prime Minister Netanyahu's attacks on democracy, including the terrible nation-state law that all but entrenches Palestinian citizens of Israel as second-class citizens. These Israelis also see the injustice being wrought upon the Palestinian people, and are pushing for change. We met a former Israeli soldier, who told us that he would go to war and die for his country but not for the occupation. He had helped run a unit that patrolled the occupied territories, but, after several years, his Israeli patriotism would not permit him to undermine his country's own conditions of existence by being expressly ordered, in his own words, to create amongst the Palestinians a permanent sense of being pursued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We met a number of members of the Israeli Knesset, the parliament, and other elected representatives. One said to us that their people were like the man who was falling from a 20-storey building; as he passes level 5, someone asks, 'How are you going?' and he replies, 'Fine, so far.' In fact, although many things stood out to me from my first visit to the region, one in particular was as clear as day: there will be no peace and security for the people of Israel if they continue down a road of occupying Palestine, cutting the territory up into enclaves surrounded by checkpoints and walls and divided by roads along which only one class of people can travel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I speak, at this very moment, elections are underway in Israel. In these elections, as Na'ama Carlin writes, published on the ABC today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ 2.7 million Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank do not have the right to vote in the Israeli election, even as their neighbours from Israeli settlements (deemed illegal by international law) erected on Palestinian land, do. Palestinians will watch from the sidelines as illegal settlers vote in an election that will determine how Palestinians live, where and under what conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As if that weren't enough, as part of his re-election pitch, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed just a few days ago that he will break international law and illegally annex large parts of the West Bank, surrounding the city of Jericho, which we visited, and turning it into another Gaza-like enclave. Not only will this rob the Palestinian people of some of the most fertile land in the area, it will undermine the prospects of a viable two-state solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: the people of Israel have a right to live in peace and security. That means an independent state that allows its people to flourish. But so too do their neighbours. The people of Palestine have a right to live in peace and security. That means an independent state that allows its people to flourish. And this is the thing: the current strategy of Netanyahu and many of his predecessors of taking over more land and subjugating the people even further has no end point that doesn't undermine what the government of Israel says is its main goal. Is the aim of this strategy to create a single Israeli state by taking over all of Palestinian land? If so, do the Palestinian people then get 'one person, one vote, one value' in this new state? Or will they be second-class citizens, destined to have no vote, no control and no state? That's an intolerable situation for a country that says it's a democracy. Alternatively, if the aim is to keep showing this kind of aggression yet pretend to be in favour of a two-state solution, noting that members of the current Israeli government routinely speak against such an outcome, the very land that would be the basis of a new state has been cut out from underneath the Palestinian people. The end game is not a good one. This strategy of expanded occupation is unsustainable for the Israeli people and deadly for the Palestinians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, some voices usually arise to say, 'You said nothing about the attacks on Israeli citizens.' So let me be clear again: of course rocket attacks on civilians are to be condemned. People should not be firing rockets at other people. Also to be condemned are the seemingly random acts of violence committed at bus stops and on roadsides which contribute to people living in a permanent state of fear. But, if we want these attacks to stop, surely it is time to press for a just peace settlement? The representatives of the Palestinian Authority we met made it clear that, contrary to Netanyahu's rhetoric, they had positions on the 'final status' issues and were prepared to talk. But, instead of progress, we see continued illegal and aggressive activity from the Israeli government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If ever there was a time for us here in Australia to recognise the state of Palestine and to use all our democratic pressure to get the Israeli government to the table to negotiate a lasting peace it is now. The so-called Trump peace plan won't deliver this, if the terrible announcements to date are anything to go by. They amount to nothing more than a bribe to give up sovereignty in return for an unfunded promise of imaginary money. It is possible, although unlikely, that the result of the Israeli election will shift the US's thinking. But, if it doesn't, the international community, including Australia, must stand up and do so urgently.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Kuwaiti government for their hospitality in organising the trip. I still remember the words of the Kuwaiti parliament's Speaker, who urged Australia to be part of the efforts towards a lasting peace for the Palestinians and Israelis based on self-determination. Without it, he told us, the treatment of the Palestinian people will be recruitment material for terrorist groups in the region for years and years to come. I say to both the Palestinian people fighting for justice and those forces in Israeli society fighting for equality for all peoples: thank you for your hospitality. You have our support, and I hope to come back again someday.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I rise today to speak on an issue that is important to one of our prominent communities in the Ryan electorate, and that is the veteran community. Before I start, I want to acknowledge all of those in my electorate and from across Australia who have served and continue to serve in our defence forces to protect and secure our great country. I want to thank them for the sacrifices they make. Most of us may not ever truly know what it is like to serve in our forces, but what the Australian community does know, and indeed expects, is that our veterans are looked after and cared for in the way they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ryan is home to the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera. Spanning around 200 hectares, the barracks is a major operational base and is home to three brigades. We also house the Enoggera Close Training Area, adjacent to the barracksâsome 450 hectares. This facility has a number of small-arms ranges and is an important resource for individual training. Ryan currently has 7,640 serving personnel. Many of those who have served in these facilities, once they are no longer in the defence forces, choose to stay and continue to work and raise their families in our local community. We have close to 2,500 veterans in Ryan, and they make an invaluable contribution right across the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with these constituents in mind that I rise today to speak on our continued commitment to supporting our veterans. The Morrison government is committed to putting support for veterans and their families first. We have budgeted more than $11 billion in support services this financial year alone. This commitment is an investment in both the mental and physical health of our veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently the government tabled the final report of the Productivity Commission into compensation and rehabilitation for veterans, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">A better way to support our veterans</span>. It comprehensively outlined recommendations and findings on how we can continue to improve in this area. We are looking at ways in which veterans can more simply access the support they need when they need it. In the biggest reform in the 100-year history of the DVA, we've invested nearly $500 million in a transformation program that will see the DVA shifting away from an illness model to an overall wellbeing model of care and support. The change to this model seeks to empower veterans to achieve greater independence for themselves and their families, for their health and wellbeing. It is streamlining processes, making them easier to find and easier to use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last election, the Morrison government announced a $30 million investment in the development of a national network of six veterans wellbeing centres. It is intending to establish six centres, across Perth, Adelaide, Wodonga, Nowra, Darwin and Townsville. In Townsville, of course, my colleague the member for Herbert continues to do so much work with the veteran community. The member for Herbert is indeed a champion for veterans' issues within our team. This is all part of the transformation program. Once established, these centres will serve to facilitate and enable integrated support for the veterans and their families. Partnering with the community, these centres will act as a hub for veteran support and will foster partnerships with the local community and local businessâa collaborative approach where veterans have a say, where they have input as to what they need and how best to achieve it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government consults extensively with the veteran community, and this year at the Veterans Mental Health and Wellbeing Summit these centres were discussed. Veterans with the experience of what it is like to seek these services and access support feel the best way we can achieve the desired outcomes from these wellbeing centres is through a process co-designed with the veteran community. Sometimes consultation can be formal, like the consultation I've just discussed, or sometimes consultation can be as simple and informal as sitting around listening to stories over a beer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a privilege recently to have a beer with the passionate veterans of the Gaythorne RSL. The Gaythorne RSL is the closest RSL club to the Gallipoli Barracks and is already a hub for those local vets who choose to continue post service and to call our community home. They told me about the work they do in the DVA support space. They are dedicated to it. It is their passion. They offer free pension and advocacy services to serving and ex-serving members and their families. They already have a broad network of support and they collaborate with other organisations such as Soldier On and community organisations seeking to support our veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Veteran welfare officers from the Gaythorne RSL regularly visit the homes, hospitals and aged-care facilities of our veterans. They operate the Mitchie Day Club, another service sponsored by the Gaythorne RSL that is a good example of the interaction between the local community and the veteran community. Working together, they provide a wide range of activities that are intended to socialise veterans with the wider communityâfrom tai chi to bus trips and game days. Significant events, such as Anzac Day, as you would expect, are hosted at the Gaythorne RSL and attract upwards of 3,000 attendees each and every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I mention the Gaythorne RSL at the same time as the wellness centres is that I think the Gaythorne RSL does such a good job to help our veteran community that it would be an ideal location for a veteran wellbeing centre in the future. Geographically, it would service the Enoggera Barracks, which I mentioned earlier, but also the broader serving community across Brisbane, including personnel from the Victoria Barracks and the RAAF barracks at Amberley. As I said, the RSL already has strong ties with groups such as Soldier On. In fact, the Gaythorne RSL have the capacity, balance sheet and resources that, with just a modest contribution from the Commonwealth, they could establish a base for an increased offering for veterans of South-East Queensland. They could become a wellness centre, a hub that is co-designed between the Commonwealth and the Gaythorne RSL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I spoke to Minister Chester about the excellent work the Gaythorne RSL do and requested that they be considered as a location for a future wellbeing centre if the program is rolled out further than the five locations the government has already announced. I spoke earlier this evening about the fact that these hubs work best for our veteran community when they are co-designed between the location and the local veterans and the Commonwealth. It's with that in mind that I take the opportunity to invite Minister Chester up to the Ryan electorate and, indeed, the Gaythorne RSL to have a beer, like I did, with the veterans there and to talk about how we can further progress establishing the Gaythorne RSL as a wellness centre for our veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the Gaythorne RSLâthe welfare officers who do so much for our local veteran community and all the men and women who support the RSL's operation. I look forward to continuing to hear their stories and to work with them on getting the best outcomes for our veterans in the Ryan electorate. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  Good government takes good vision, good government takes guts and good government demands compassion. Labor governments are the ones that deliver these things. We provide vision, we legislate reform and we are compassionate. The same, quite clearly, cannot be said of this government. Ever since Tony Abbott took control of this coalition, it no longer knows what it stands for. It defines itself by what it opposes, not what it supports. It is a government bereft of ideas and agenda, with the only abiding sentiment being the one it steeled in opposition: fear-driven populism. This might sometimes be an election-winning strategy, but it does not make for good government. It does not provide a plan for how this country is going to navigate the turbulent waters ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With no plan but an undying thirst for power, the Morrison government has resorted to what's now termed 'wedgislation', which is legislation brought into the parliament with the specific purpose of being a test for Labor. The kind of government that uses acts of parliament as a test for the opposition is the kind of government that displays its lack of values and has its priorities completely wrong. 'Whose side are you on?' is the standard hyper-partisan cry from the PM and his flying monkeys. They've reduced policy debate to a schoolyard stoushâeither you're shirts or you're skins. The one-trick-pony PM relies on divisive politics and jeering at Labor to deflect scrutiny whenever questions are raised about the shonky dealings of the government. That's because Prime Minister Morrison's thoughts are binary. He wants you to believe that everything is either black or white. No-one will ever accuse him of sophistication, complexity or depth in thought process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we ask: whose turn is it this week? Which group of marginalised Australians has the PM got his sights set on: disabled people, the elderly, Australian workers? Look, it's been a very busy week with the serious questions about impropriety by members of the government, so let's go after the easy targetâthe unemployed. It is astoundingâbut, sadly, not at all unexpectedâthat a political party would seek government and then rush to pass legislation which will demonise elderly Australians by demanding they give urine samples before receiving unemployment payments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ruston cries: 'Taxpayers expect the government to ensure their money is being spent responsibly and that welfare recipients are using it to put food on the table, send their kids to school and pay their bills, rather than on drugs.' The Australian National Council on Drugs has previously found there was no evidence that drug testing welfare beneficiaries would have any positive effect on those individuals or society as a whole. This antagonistic plan by the Morrison government to drug test welfare recipients is purely designed to attack poor peopleânot to fight poverty, not to help people, just to demonise them. Even when they focus on this small issue, they don't even get it close to right. Instead of treating drug abuse with the complexity and understanding it deservesâthrough a lens of health careâthey instead focus on the punitive measures which demonise vulnerable Australians. This is not 'unfunded empathy'. It betrays Australia's long tradition of egalitarianism and attacks the very heart of the social contract that underpins this nation's success. The question is: why doesn't the government attack poverty instead of attacking poor people? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is equally incredible that a political party should sit on those benches and shower doubt on the irrefutable fact that climate change is influenced by the actions of humans. It is a signal to farmers across the country that the government is not on their side when it comes to dealing with the catastrophic effects of global warming. You might think that, even if the coalition can't deal with climate change, maybe they could focus on the effects of our changing environment. Yet, after six years in power, the Nationals have not begun a dam-building spree. There's been no push for environmental regulations that might help prevent the more frequent and increasing intense natural disasters. The one constant with drought and changing climate is that the Nationals are all talk and no action when it comes to assisting farmers or the environment they're in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also seems the government is determined to stick to the status quo and evidence be damned when it comes to their failed robo-debt. There is no clearer example of this than a scheme that hounds people, including my constituents, to recoup money which in a huge number of cases was never, ever owed in the first place. This was the case in my electorate, where a woman who worked for 15 years was a victim of this predatory scheme. After falling ill, my constituent was forced to take leave and she benefited from the Centrelink sickness allowance. When received a message from the robo-debt system saying that she owed $1,200 she knew something was wrong. While my team was able to help her, thousands of others don't know their options or are too scared to challenge a government department. The minister has stated there were approximately 160,000 people who have experienced financial stress and accusations of wrongdoing, all over money they never owed in the first place. This is another example of a government that treats decent Australians with contempt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party likes to proclaim they are fantastic economic managers. Whenever the coalition is in power, 'the adults are in charge of the economy', they cry. Right now and not for the first time, it seems the adults have been asleep at the wheel. GDP growth is at its lowest since the GFC. Wages have been stagnant for years. The Reserve Bank governor has bemoaned the lack of investment in Australia's infrastructure, and the coalition simply pretend it's not happening. There is not one forward-thinking economic policy that has come from the government benches since they came to power. This is because in the modern day Liberal Party no-one believes in sound economic management. It is no longer the party of Menzies and Fraser. It is a shell of its former self, whose only goal is to cling to power at all costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They often criticise Labor for talking down the economy. Let me be clear: we're not talking it down. We're actually highlighting and putting a spotlight on the coalition's history of economic management, because there has been none. It's all talk and no action. Remember March 2013, when 'Sloppy' Joe Hockey and Abbott promised a surplus in their first year of government and one in each and every year after that? What did they deliver? None. They doubled the debt, doubled the deficit, cut education, cut science, cut health and cut taxes for banks. That was their huge ideaâtax cuts for banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Debt, deficit and deflection: they are the hallmarks of this morally bankrupt and ethically challenged government. These are examples of a trend that has been occurring over the last six years. Increasingly, the government has sidelined the interests of working and middle-class Australians in favour of big business. The Prime Minister has determined that the best path forward is 'us versus them'âone that has no space for nuance, expert opinions or compassion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's legislative agenda is determined by policies that play on fears and insecurities and work against the average Australian, alienate our neighbours and stoke an uneasy cauldron in immigration history. Nearly two decades ago, Shane Stone told John Howard that the Australian people see their party as 'mean and tricky'. It seems that the years have passed and this has become ever more entrenched. The government are entrenched in controversy every day: Palladium, Helloworld, Crownâthe list goes on. It is no wonder they've voted against and shut down debate on having a national integrity commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister likes to pose the question, 'Whose side are you on?' Prime Minister, we're on the side of ordinary Australians: the ones who work hard and try to build a better life for themselves; the parents who struggle each day just to put food on the table and pay the bills; the young families who want to give their kids the best opportunities; the elderly who have built this nation and just want a decent quality of life and not to be forced to work until they're 70; and the workers who put in a full day's work and expect a living wage in their entitlements pay. We're on the side of the disabled and their families who just want to get the support they need when they need it. I'm on the side of an inclusive Australia, one that builds up and doesn't tear down the millions of Australians who aren't in high-paying jobs. They're having a go, but they're not getting a go under this government. These are the people whose side we are on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I rise this evening to address one of the very important challenges, but also opportunities, for my state of South Australiaâthat being the topic of population growth. To give a bit of background, unfortunately we have to look back some time to the very early 1990s in South Australia where, under the then Labor government, the State Bank of South Australia collapsed, leaving a crippling debt that really took the best part of a decade for the subsequent Liberal government to get a handle on. After their defeat in 2002, another 16 years of Labor government has meant that ever since 1991 we've had very low population growth in South Australiaâaveraging about 0.8 per cent over the last 10 years, compared to the national population growth of 1.6 per cent. When I talk about population growth figuresâjust to be clear, because people use different figures with different methodologyâI'm talking about the net outcome of births and deaths, net interstate migration and net overseas migration. In South Australia that's been 0.8 per cent on average over the last 10 years, compared to 1.6 per cent in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very dangerous statistic, if we let it set in in South Australia for much longer, because that population rate, frankly, is going to continue to put enormous economic pressure and strain on the state of South Australia. Obviously an ageing population requires an ever-growing economic capacity to meet the cost of that generation, who deserve to be looked after by their governments, state and federal. It's very difficult if the fiscal circumstance gets to the point where the ratio of people in retirement age, post-65, continues to increase against that of people that are of working age, paying their taxes and supporting the ability for governments to provide all the services required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very important challenge, and it is one that's a contrast to other parts of the nation. There are certainly parts of this country that have got the other problemâpopulation growth perhaps at a rate that is a little too high, which is putting a lot of pressure on the infrastructure in those parts of the country. Victoria is growing at about 2.2 per cent, well above the national rate of 1.6 per cent. In particular, about 100,000 people a year are moving into the city of Melbourne, not just from the migration program. There is a lot of interstate migration that contributes to that figure. That's putting enormous pressure on infrastructure in parts of Melbourne. Sydney and the south-east corner of Queensland are in a similar position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not here to talk down my state, despite the fact that we've had a rough couple of decades, and not just because of the State Bank collapse, which was probably the best marker of a period of challenge. In more recent times, the car industry has closed down in South Australia. We've been very reliant on our traditional industries that are still strong, like agriculture and the mining sector. Nonetheless, we've needed to attract new industries to create a bright future for our state. Happily, that is now the case with the change of government to a Liberal government 18 months ago and the attraction of major defence contracts to our stateâthe Future Submarine program, the Type 26 frigate program and the first component of the offshore patrol vesselsâwith a combined $90 billion investment over decades to come from the federal Morrison government into the state of South Australia. We've also seen the announcement of the Australian Space Agency, which is to be headquartered in Adelaide. That is significant enough on its own, but the opportunity to create an industry ecosystem around the Space Agency headquarters being based at the Lot Fourteen precinct on North Terrace is enormous. Space is an industry that will absolutely boom in coming years. In Adelaide and in South Australia, we are very well placed to take advantage of those opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But population growth is something that we need to address very urgently. I hope that the South Australian economy will be at a point very soon where there will be a natural attraction for interstate migration, particularly among young people. When the people I went to school with were finishing tertiary studies 15 years ago, many of them found that the opportunities they were looking for from a career point of view were not there in Adelaide. They had to take their opportunities in Melbourne, Sydney, Singapore, London or New York because the Adelaide economy wasn't providing the opportunities that they sought to foster their career and grow to their full potential. That is absolutely being challenged, with some of the clear opportunities in defence, in space, in cybersecurity, as well as our traditional industries, like mining, agriculture and the wine sector that are still going strong. But we need to kickstart population growth in South Australia, and it's one of these self-fulfilling prophecies. As you increase your population growth, that stimulates so many sectors of the economyâparticularly the construction sectorâwhich go on to fuel more economic opportunities and more job opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One very important thing that we've established in South Australia, which deals with some of the challenges and arguments that are being confronted in places like Melbourne, Sydney and South-East Queensland, is a statutory infrastructure body that is independent of government with an independent chair and a board of seven, who are all industry experts and highly capable. They are entrusted with the responsibility of developing a 20-year infrastructure plan for the state of South Australia with a rolling five-year implementation plan for the first five years of that 20-year plan, which will continue to roll on and on and on. The beauty of that is that we can plan for the infrastructure requirements of growing our population. As long as we're prepared to make the important decisions to invest the funds required as they're demonstrably needed, we can make sure that we don't put ourselves in a position that other jurisdictions have found themselves in because they didn't make the right decisions 10, 15 or 20 years ago to make sure their infrastructure was keeping up with their growth. South Australia is in a unique position to accelerate its population growth and at the same time not have some of the more acute challenges that have come along with that population growth in other parts of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The exciting thing for me is that the federal government has understood, appreciated and implemented population policy and migration policy that accepts that we can't have just a single attitude to immigration and population growth in this country, because, as I've just outlined, we've got some parts of our country that have enormous population pressures on them and other parts of the country that are crying out for people to move to them to contribute to the local economies and fill skills shortages. So the Morrison government has instituted a new and enhanced regional migration program of 23,000 places per year. In the 2019-20 financial year, there are 23,000 people that can access this stream. It effectively designates the entire country, apart from Melbourne, Sydney, South-East Queensland and Perth. For some reason the Western Australian government wanted to have Perth opt out of this opportunity. I'm from South Australia, so that's fine with me. I think they're making a mistake, given some of the data that is coming through on the trends in their population growth, which has collapsed in the last few years. Nonetheless, we are pursuing a policy framework that allows differentiation so that the parts of the country that are crying out for more peopleâlike South Australia and my home city of Adelaideâcan, in fact, attract those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm watching with great interest and excitement as this new set of policy measures is being implemented. My hope is that this will be an early shot in the arm for the South Australian economy, that it will drive initial population growth through these policy settings and that, in the medium term, on the strength of the natural growth of our economy, we will then return to the nation's natural population growth of 1.6 per cent.</span>
