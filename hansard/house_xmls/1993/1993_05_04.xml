       He must have an intimate understanding of parliamentary life, of the problems of Members collectively and individually, of the moods and foibles of the House; an experience which can be acquired only through many years spent on the benches of the House itself.

       I believe Don Dobie has demonstrated these qualities through his long political career. His parliamentary contributions have been many and varied. He entered the House for the first time in 1966 and served as Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Mr McMahon, and was Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1970 to 1971 and again from 1979 to 1983. He was the coalition Whip from 1983 to 1985 and Deputy Chairman of Committees again from 1985 to the present day. He has been the chairperson of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and he served on a wide variety of other parliamentary committees, including the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House.

Don Dobie, I would like, first of all, to bring to the attention of the House the history of the role of Speaker in the wonderful parliamentary system we have in Australia. I do not know whether people know this, but centuries ago in the British Parliament the role of Speaker was a very difficult one. On many occasions the Speaker had to be dragged to the chair to take on the role. Of course, today the Speaker has to be dragged out of the chair.

        In those ancient times it was customary for the nominator and the seconder of the elected Speaker to drag him, kicking and squirming, to the chair because in those days the Speaker was often in a lot of strife with the king or the personage of the day. Speakers were often assassinated, murdered or executed. So the Speaker did not really want to be the Speaker.

        The speakership is a very important position in our democracy. It is about the quality of the person in the job. The way in which that position is fulfilled decides how the parliamentary chamber performs. I think the responsibility is today all the greater given the fact that Parliament is now televised and there is quite a large following of people who actually see and watch Parliament, as there was quite a number who listened to the radio. Parliament is broadcast live contemporaneously with the sitting and then the telecast is reshown later. There is no doubt that television has given many members of the public an insight into the chamber and the personalities of the members of the House, whereas radio was somewhat limited, although it always obtained a reasonable rating over the years.

        This has, I think, made the speakership even more important for the way in which the House and the Standing Orders are administered. The key quality for any Speaker is integrity. It is never easy managing a party house, representing as it does the various interests of the nation. To have a Speaker drawn from one of the political parties has always placed pressure on such a nominee to be seen to manage the business of the House fairly and equitably. The quality of integrity is the one that matters the most.

        I think you have this quality and, therefore, I am quite sure that the judgments you will bring to bear as Speaker will be fair and reasonable. The key to the job, though, is flexibility and commonsense. A chamber that is a debating house cannot be run without these qualities. All the Speakers in my time here have had these qualities. Some have displayed them more fluently on occasions than others; nevertheless, they have been there. That commonsense and flexibility are what oil the system and let it continue to be effective.

I do not think we have to pay hypocritical lip-service to the removal of conflict in the chamber: this is the clearing house of Australian political pressures. The big issues are brought to bear here and they are debated here. One cannot expect such a debate to continue with such high stakes for various members of the community and the delivery of programs or the policies of the government of the day without those matters producing at least some heat in the debate.

        It is the question of efficiency that probably occupies most of our mindsâ€”being able to dispense the business of the Parliament efficiently, while retaining the quality of debate. The debates have changed over the years. When I first came here, members' speeches during second reading debates would be reported. In fact, when members wished to be noticed hereâ€”when they wanted to build their reputation as new membersâ€”they did it invariably during second reading debates in the House, and quite often one would see a good contribution reasonably well covered in the media. That does not happen today. Most of the focus of the day is on Question Time, which is good for information but a pity for the chamber.

I would like to see the coverage in the media of the parliamentary day and its impact on the community more balanced than it is, away from Question Time, giving the rank and file members of the Parliament a chance to participate more fully.

        It goes without saying, Mr Speaker, that we were not particularly happy with the parliamentary performance as it occurred in the last session, and I have no doubt that in the eyes of most people in Australia the standing of politicians has fallen quite dramatically. It is a very real challenge for all of us to lift our game and clean up our act in this place.

        I do not have to remind people on our side of the House of the difficulty we had in getting the Prime Minister to debate us on any issue. To get him to debate us on unemployment we basically had to censure him in the course of the last Parliament, and Question Time was reduced to nothing short of a mockery. We thought things got bad under Hawke. In his last year, I think the number of questions got down to about 13; under the current Prime Minister it fell to about 11â€”we were getting five or six questions a day. The average length of answers went up quite dramatically from about three minutes under Fraser, to four minutes under Hawke, to six minutes under this Prime Minister. We are looking for all of that to be improved in this Parliament. I am reminded of a statement made by a previous Speaker, Joan Child, who said:

       In the last session, we all did ourselves a disservice with our performance in this House. The Government, in particular, ran down the proceedings of this House for its own personal gain, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in this country in 60 years. That crisis continues to get worse. Today we have a balance of payments current account of $2.1 billion. The crisis continues. If this Parliament is to play its proper part in dealing with that crisis, and in emphasising the significance of debate, we look forward with relish to the Prime Minister's setting the example, actually participating in that debate and elevating the debates in this place to a much higher significance than Question Time, which is what the people of Australia would like to see.

        Mr Speaker, the House of Representatives must be far more relevant to the people of Australia if there is to be a change in the respect that Australians hold for the institution of parliament. This is even more important during these times of horrific recession and rural depression, in this time of drought and unprecedented crisis in the wool industry, the citrus industry and so many other industries. Today this is underlined by the terrific blow-out in the balance of payments adding to the burden of the situation. There is a great deal of heartache and heartbreak out there in so much of Australia at this time. Our deliberations, the proceedings in this place, must recognise that and have empathy for that situation. Our debates must seek solutions to the problems that arise.

        In that context, I would make three additional suggestions in respect of the proceedings in this place. I have said previously and I say again that I think that the Speaker should never hesitate to rise to his feet when the occasion requires it to bring control to the proceedings of this House. Mr Speaker, you once worked with Laurie Kelly when he was the member for Corrimal and then Speaker of the ultimate bearpit of bearpits, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliament House, Macquarie Street, Sydney. Those of us who have graduated from that place of learning, the political university of universities, know well what it is to be a member of a bitter debating chamber. Equally, in the worst of the situations in the Legislative Assembly in Sydney, no matter how much heat and brimstone was flying in all directions, when the Speaker rose to his feet, people on both sides of the Parliament immediately became silent and gave to the Chair the respect that it deserved in that circumstance and allowed control to be restored. So I simply commend to you, Mr Speaker, as part of the weaponry that you have, the practice of rising to your feet when the occasion demands. I am sure that we will all extend to you the courtesy that you deserve on that occasion.

        The second thing that I want to draw to your attention is that it is a matter of record that in the past 10 years one side of this House has had 41 members sin-binned or suspended and the other side of this House has had just one member sin-binned or suspended. One does not have to be brilliant to work out which side is which.

Mr Speaker, I know that you have been an outstanding referee in that code of football called rugby league. I hope that in your jurisdiction as Speaker of the House you will rectify that imbalance and be absolutely fair in the administration of the absolute power to suspend a member from the service of the House. Only by your doing that in a clear-cut way will we regain full respect for the Chair and the proper deliberations of the House of Representatives.

        Finally, let me say that from time to time the proceedings associated with the opening of Parliament and the election of Speaker have been discussed with a view to review. Apparently, time did not permit the ultimate deliberation and consultation necessary to streamline aspects of those proceedings. I renew the suggestion that the House of Representatives would be well advised to pick up a proceeding from the House of Commons and that the election of Speaker be conducted by the senior member in continuing service in the House of Representatives. He or she would take the role of the Clerk in conducting the election of the Speaker. In saying that, I make no reflection and cast no aspersion on the Clerk of the House, for whom I have a great deal of regard. I want to make the point that I believe that it is a convention, a tradition, a custom, which we in the House of Representatives could initiate and followâ€”one entirely appropriate to the dignity of the Parliament. That would then mean that in the current circumstance the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would carry out the election of the Speaker.

        The first item that I think is of significance regarding the office of Speaker occurred on 27 February 1975. That was the date upon which the Whitlam Government voted down Speaker James Cope for having the temerity, for the first time in Labor Party history, to seek to discipline a Labor Minister, Clyde Cameron. He had insulted the Chair and refused to apologise. The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, prevented Labor Leader of the House, Fred Daly, from moving the customary motion of suspension, and the responsibility fell to the leader of Opposition business, Mr Ian Sinclair. The Labor Government then instructed its members to vote against the motionâ€”a clear vote of no confidence in their own elected Speaker, who subsequently resigned from the chair. Among those listed as voting down their own Speaker were P. Keating, J. Dawkins and R. Willisâ€”the present Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. It is not, therefore, surprisingâ€”to me at leastâ€”that recent speakers in the Labor Government have shown little effort to be fair or firm with the actions of their own Government Ministers.

        The second item of history that I think is of significance occurred on 27 April 1992 in the British House of Commons when the Rt Hon. Betty Boothroyd, a Labour MP, was nominated by the Conservative Prime Minister of England, Mr John Major, as Speaker and duly elected. She had previously been a deputy speaker in the Conservative Government. That, of course, is because of the massive confidence that the British politicians have in the Westminster system as it is conducted with regard to the office of Speaker. Mr Speaker, you would be aware, I am sure, that in that place the Speaker resigns from his or her political party. The convention requires that the Speaker not be opposed in his or her electorate and that he or she stand as a truly independent person.

Clearly, in our system you would not be expected to resign from your party, but my recollection of what happened in the Fraser Government was that the then Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, seldom entered the party room of the Liberal Party and did his best to keep himself away from those sorts of actions.

       Given that the duration of Question Time has remained static, how can the number of questions have dropped? The answer is clearly that the Government's answers, especially to questions from its own backbench, have become longer.

        â€”There has been significant comment over time that the Standing Orders need to be changed. I think the Standing Orders were written by some very wise gentlemen, based on a long experience of the activities of politicians. When one looks at those Standing Orders relating to Question Time where most of the disputation arises, we find that they clearly try to cut off the options for abuse. Standing order 142 reads:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which heâ€”

       is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible.
      </para>
      <para>
       In that regard, of course, there is a wealth of precedent as to how past Speakers have ruled on that matter. It is pretty clear. Precedent says that if one does not ask a Minister a question about his or her area of responsibilityâ€”there is a wealth of precedent to say that opposition policy is not a Minister's area of responsibility; I think we could agree with that as a matter of logicâ€”the question is out of order.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Other Standing Orders relate to the asking of questions. I think they are particularly proper. Principally, they say, `Ask for information, and keep it short'. Then there is the issue of the answer. Standing order 145 states:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       An answer shall be relevant to the question.
      </para>
      <para>
       That requires no interpretation. In fact, it is quite clear that it would be out of order in an answer to refer at great length to Opposition policy et cetera if the question had nothing to do with Opposition business. So the challenges for you, sir, are to break with some of that history. The challenge for the Government in this Parliament is, maybe, to wipe out the stain of Speaker Cope. I hope we see that all happening. Mr Speaker, I thank you for your time and I repeat my congratulations.

        I also, believe it or not, want to thank the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) because history is important to us all. A sense of history of this place is something which we all strive to be part of. At the same time, that sense of history teaches us something about the past and how we might want to improve things for the future.

        In the past couple of days I have said that I, and I am sure many of my colleagues, have received numerous letters from people in our constituencies who were concerned about the process of the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and others also made reference to aspects of the parliamentary process such as Question Time, relevancies and so on. However, as
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        shows, many former Speakers at the time of their election have said that these sorts of comments constantly come up. It seems that people have not learnt from history and have not been prepared to accept change. By people I mean honourable members of this Parliament.

        The Speaker's role is critical in ensuring a businesslike, efficient development of the parliamentary process here. At the same time, that position is only made easy through honourable members on both sides cooperating and respecting not only the high office of the Speaker but, more importantly, the institution of Parliament. I have listened with great interest as people have made comment on that. It would seem that we all hold those very high ideals. It is hoped that in this coming Parliament we all work out our own ways to put those ideals in place.

         There is no doubt that words like `fairness' and `impartiality' flow very easily. There is no doubt that people would like to see the Speaker's role as one which does not bring that into question. I can only give an undertaking to all honourable members that that is what I will be striving to do.

        It is a great responsibility to be the Speaker in the Parliament of Australia. After all, this is the premier parliament of this country. This is where the most critical and important decisions, shaping the lives of each and every Australian, are made. It is a very high honour. As individual members of Parliament we have a great responsibility to represent our constituents and to represent broader Australia. We might have different philosophies as to how we should get to that end point, but at the end of the day we all want that same great thing for this countryâ€”and that is a better Australia.

I humbly say to them that I understand their aims and aspirations and I hope to reflect them here in this place. I also understand the pride that they have in knowing that one of their ownâ€”described in our local newspaper, the

I will be endeavouring to administer both to the best of my capability.

        Some comment has been made about changes to the parliamentary process; parliamentary reform has been mentioned. I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that this is an issue that will be looked at. I look forward to seeing the recommendations that come forward. People often like to quote the Standing Orders, but I come back to the fact that the operation of this chamber is in our hands collectively. It is the members who make recommendations to procedure committees and to Government Ministers about changes to the Standing Orders. I look forward to the cooperation of all honourable members in that respect.

Building on this strategy, in the light of the success of the Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) Program, and the number of high quality applications made in the last round, the Government has decided it will invite applications to establish ten more CRCs in 1994-95.

         The Government places a high priority on the task of reforming the Corporations Law, given the potential impact that corporate regulation has on the investment environment. In order to restore and maintain investor confidence, we need to ensure that our laws are adequate to the task of enforcing appropriate standards of corporate accountability, including through adequate disclosure to investors, and that there are appropriate checks and balances on corporate decision-makers. At the same time, our laws must be flexible and adapted to the needs of a modern economy.  An important step to achieving this will be to set in train a program for the systematic simplification of the Corporations Law to make it more accessible and understandable to business and the professions.

        I was interested to hear the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier today about the need to recognise that debate in this place will of necessity be robust and involve strong exchange of argument. As the Prime Minister noted, we ought not be squeamish about this. This is, after all, the ultimate `clearing house' for policy in this nation. However, I believe that we need to be conscious of the fact that the Australian people are currently inclined to be both apathetic and cynical when it suits them about politicians in general, and, increasingly in recent times, about what happens in this chamber in particular. I believe that people discern very quickly the motivation of members in this place. It is not so much heated debate over issues that they object to; in fact it may well often be the lack of heated debate over issues and the overabundance of heated personality clashes, point scoring and ego-tripping that disturb Australians.

        Briefly, he was elected to this place as the honourable member for Cowper in 1984 after a varied range of activities, including being a man on the land. He was involved in the administration of the University of New England. He is well known for his journalistic abilities, and he had quite a background in journalism. He had an involvement in local government and served from 1952 to 1954 with the CMF. He has served on a range of committees in this place and has been Deputy Chairman of Committees since 1990. He has presence, dignity and a strong, firm voice. I believe that he would make an excellent Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees and I commend him as such.

If my memory serves me correctly, he said that the key quality of the person who holds the position of Speaker is integrity. Other qualities which he saw as important are flexibility and commonsense. In the time that I have been in this Parliament, they are the qualities which have been the hallmark of the honourable member for Scullin's contributions thus far,  whether as a backbencher participating in debate in this Parliament; as the Chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs; prior to that as Chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Publications; or in his involvement in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts or the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology.

        In that sense, I see him as a person who is very well suited to take the position of Deputy Speaker. His involvement in the politics of the Labor Party perhaps improves his qualifications immeasurably because, as members on this side of the House will know, he has had the arduous task of steering his way through as chairman of the Left caucus. That in itself can be a challenging responsibility. He has carried out that responsibility with the dexterity, footwork, commonsense and objectivity required for the position of Speaker.

Mr Speaker, you are a government nominee.

As I said in March 1990, before my parliamentary career was rudely interrupted, my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and I go back some time. I first met the honourable member when I was a councillor with the shire of Diamond Valley and he was serving as a councillor with the then shire, now the city, of Whittlesea. The honourable member and I, as members of parliament, share in an electoral sense both parts of the shire of Diamond Valley and part of the now city of Whittlesea.

I am proud to stand here as the Labor Party's nominee for this position, but I will endeavour, with all my abilities, to carry out my role as Deputy Speaker with the greatest amount of impartiality. The three years I have had as a temporary chairman of committees taught me one thing: when we sit in that chair we are never sure who our friends or enemies might be on a given day.

        The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) mentioned that we are at a very important stage in the history of the nation and, probably, in the history of this Parliament. Whilst we learn a lot from all those historic precedents, we now have to do our own thing and attack not only the perceived problems that we have with the conduct of the chamber but also the real problems. A lot of pressure has been placed on the way we are envisaged by the wider public because of the televising of proceedings. I tend to agree with the Prime Minister: perhaps not much has changed, but people's ability to see us in action has changed. I hope that with all the words that were said this morning and with the goodwill that can be mustered we will attack the way we operate, look at ways of improving it and, through that process, achieve our aim of making this nation an even stronger and better one.

        Paul Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck was born on 1 April 1905 at Perth, Western Australia, and was educated at Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia. He began his working life in 1922 as a journalist for the

         Sir Paul joined the Department of External Affairs in 1941 and served in a number of positions, including counsellor in charge of the Australian mission to the United Nations in New York.

By any reckoning, Sir Paul Hasluck enjoyed a distinguished parliamentary career. One can tell from the record that he was no ordinary journalist.

The career of Sir Paul Hasluck was among the most varied and successful in Australian public life. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has provided details of Sir Paul's many achievementsâ€”as a journalist, as a diplomat, as a historian, as a man of letters, as a senior government Minister for 18 years, and as a Governor-General. In my brief remarks I want to focus on two things: firstly, on the nature and the meaning of Sir Paul's unique contribution to Australian public life and, secondly, on Sir Paul's contribution to Australia's liberal tradition.

         Sir Paul spent much of his career either making history or writing about it. As Minister for Territories, then Minister for Defence, and later Minister for External Affairs, and as a Cabinet Minister for more than 13 years, Sir Paul was at the centre of the key political events that shaped Australian history in the decades after the Second World War. In Aboriginal affairs and in Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea in particular, Sir Paul made a contribution which started a vital process of reform and a vital process of policy reassessment.

         Sir Paul brought to the making of history the same qualities he brought to writing about it: an uncompromising attention to detail, a thorough understanding of the broader issues at stake, a self-sufficiency that sustained him in difficult times, and a capacity for hard work, sincerity and integrity that few, if any, Australians in public life have ever exceeded. The result is that his memoirs and his histories are essential reading for anyone seriously interested in understanding what the Second World War meant for Australia, how Australian postwar foreign policy evolved, how our relations with Papua New Guinea changed, and many other aspects of our national development.

         Sir Paul was steady, strong, and principled under pressure. He was an intellectual but an unpretentious and self-effacing one.

         Looking at the influences that shaped Sir Paul's contribution to Australia's political and intellectual life, a few are very prominent. His family was always a focal point. His parents were Salvation Army officers. Their work made him aware at first hand of the very real hardship and suffering that many people endure in their daily lives, and the example that their work provided instilled in him a lifelong sense of duty and service. Later in his life his wife, Dame Alexandra, and their children provided another important source of inspiration.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Sir Paul's love of the Australian bush was another great influence on his life. It is memorably recorded in his 1977 autobiography, referred to by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Mucking About
         </emphasis>
         . It underpins his intense sense of being Australian and his endless search for the definition of Australia's identity. That search was deeply rooted in his extensive knowledge of, respect for and pride in Australia's past. In reflecting late in his life about the challenges facing Australia, Sir Paul noted:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . our inheritance is not nostalgia for Europe but the fullness of a new experience in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        His nationalism was of a quiet, constructive kind. Just over 20 years ago he summarised his own particular sense of patriotism when he wrote in the following terms:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Patriotism is not a showy, crackling, flamboyant bit of display. It is something quiet and deep inside ourselves . . . We have the beacon of an honourable traditionâ€”a tradition now in our keeping. We have had in this land, men and women who were brave, who were kind, who were good, generous in spirit, and who were ready to serve. We have had many who died for the country they loved, many who spent all their skill and strength to build it. It is great to be in the same team.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sir Paul's concept of patriotism was a demanding one. It called for much more than just words or emotion. He put it best in a speech he made when retiring as Governor-General in 1974 when he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is a strange paradox today in Australia, when we are being more assertively Australian than ever before and crying aloud in the middle of the night with our own disturbing version of Australian roosterdom, that we are in fact less distinctively Australian than for a century past.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A great Australia has to be something more distinctive than a Little England, a Little America or a Little Asia. We can learn much from others; we inherit much from others; but we have to create Australia for ourselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sir Paul's sense of nationalism also extended to his view of Australia's place in the world. He was one of the earliest voices in Australian postwar politics that highlighted the reality of Australia's geography, and urged Australia to recognise both its responsibilities and its opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. He argued consistently that Australia had a direct and special interest in the development of relations in its own region, and the priorities of his policy making reflected that very strong personal view.

         Another great influence on Sir Paul's life was what he once called his `deep and private enjoyment of the sweet simplicities of life'. Those `sweet simplicities' combined his love of Australiana with his love of literature, music and the arts generally. In combining those loves Sir Paul merged his Australianism and his internationalism. He expressed it in his own words when he wrote in the following terms during his retirement:

        In his political life Sir Paul was deeply committed to and respectful of Australian traditions and Australian institutions. It was a commitment and respect that was not blind or unthinking.

         Sir Paul's historical scholarship, his writings and his practical political involvement made a unique contribution to the development of the Liberal tradition in Australia. Near the end of his political careerâ€”in fact in 1968â€”Sir Paul wrote that he was conservative in the sense `of thinking carefully of what you are going to destroy'. He continued:

        Sir Paul did not wish to keep everything the same forever, but he sought to take what had proved best in our past and adapt it to the needs of the present and to the needs of the future. He believed passionately in the supremacy of Parliament, in the rule of law and in the political and civil rights of all individuals. He attached fundamental importance to a high calibre, apolitical and efficiently structured public service that gave effect to the Parliament's laws and proper ministerial responsibility.

         He worked to create a strong and confident Australia, able to pursue its proper role in the region and beyond.

He saw harmony between a liberal economy and a moral community as the best foundation for a society of genuine fairness, genuine opportunity and genuine compassion.

         He had wide ranging interests, as is revealed in his autobiography referred to by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Of his many books, his volumes of the official Australian war history, which dealt with the organisation of the war in Australia, are regarded quite properly within historical circles as classics.

I will not dwell on the detail which has been covered by other speakers, but I highlight the fact that Sir Paul did not seek self-promotion and that was seen by many as an essential ingredient of his political career.

         His administration of the Territories department extended from 1951 to 1963. In other words, he was Minister for Territories for 12 consecutive years. I guess it is a manifestation of the amount of change and volatility in politics today that that will probably stand as a record which is not likely to be repeated. I think Senator Button has come closest to that record of one person holding the same Ministry for 12 years, although he departed earlier this year after a lengthy stint in the industry, technology and commerce portfolio.

Secondly, his brand of conservatism was that of a reformer, but a reformer who thought carefully of what was going to be destroyed, which is a very relevant issue and one we will need to consider as we debate such things as the Constitution. Thirdly, his modest upbringing indicates again that conservatives in this country are not necessarily from a wealthy backgroundâ€”in fact, I would assert not often from a wealthy backgroundâ€”and therefore there is nothing at all inconsistent with social conservatism and a social conscience.

         â€”It is a privilege to rise to speak on this condolence motion. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson): the Liberal Party has much to be proud of in that Sir Paul Hasluck served in its ranks for so long in this Parliament. We, as members of parliament, can all be proud of the fact that he was here. Had he never been here and simply continued any one of the careers he pursued prior to entering this chamber, he would still have been a great Australian and we would still be celebrating his memory, in some shape or form, in this chamber.

         He was a very good journalist. He was a great academic and scholar. He was a very substantial public servantâ€”a junior one, but he obviously would have risen to senior ranks had he chosen to remain in the Public Service or re-enter it at some date subsequent to his disappearance from it.

         Because it is now so long since he was in parliament, very few of us here can claim a personal connection with him. But I suspect one or two of the Opposition members who will speak to this condolence motion will nevertheless be in a position to do so and will take an opportunity to place their views on record. My personal connections with him were very slight. According to my father, he, with my father, carried me in a basket onto a plane for my first trip to Canberra. I doubt whether any two members of this chamber would be capable of doing that now, which only goes to show what giants they were in those days.

         My other connections with him came, as they do, to those who, as young people associated with members of parliament, in boyhood, girlhood and youth, invariably have the opportunity of introductions to many great people. I had those opportunities during the 1950s and 1960s. When I became a member of parliament, Sir Paul was a patron of a school in my electorateâ€”Guildford primary school, a historical school in Western Australia where he had been a student for a number of years. So I had the opportunity to meet him then, but I was no more than a nodding acquaintance and claim no more than that.

         But I would claim very considerable respect for the public career and life of Sir Paul Hasluck. Different eras provide different opportunities for people. That colonial era and the connection we had with the south-west Pacific, basically from Federation to the time when we granted independence to Papua New Guinea in 1975, permitted many extraordinary opportunities for many Australians. It enabled Black Jack McEwen to become the only successful organiser of a revolution in Australian political history. Fortunately, he did not attempt it here; he did it on New Caledonia and removed the Vichy French Government and installed the free French Government during World War II.

         Our colonial position in relation to Papua New Guinea permitted opportunities for Australians to contribute substantially to nation building. Basically, most Australians did not do thisâ€”and that included most Australians with a connection with the Territory. However, that did not apply to Sir Paul Hasluck. Because we never permit ourselves accolades in this place, and those who comment upon us do not permit us accolades, his role as territories Minister has never been properly evaluated by anyone writing a decent history of the place. But his impact was extraordinary. It cannot be measured in monuments, but he had many of them; one of them being the fact that he was a founder of the University of Papua New Guinea during his time in office.

         He was also unusual in this place and for his timeâ€”and it probably extends to this timeâ€”in his detailed and sensitive understanding of the Aboriginal people. His Salvation Army background was broad, but he concentrated mainly on developing an understanding of Aboriginal Australians. In fact, one of his first books, published in 1942, was on that subject. He carried his interest through to his conduct of the portfolio. His understanding of Aboriginal affairs extended to a genuinely bipartisan attitude. When anyone on the Opposition side took an interest, he followed up that interestâ€”and that included accepting Opposition motions for the creation of parliamentary committees to look into Aboriginal grievances.

         I would say that his time in subsequent portfolios was probably not as satisfying to him as his time spent as the external territories Minister although, again, his impact on Australian history was substantial. During his career as external affairs Minister he was unfortunate in having to operate in a period of time when basically the public conduct of Australian foreign policy was, to some extent, poisoned by the debate on, and participation in, the Vietnam war. I am not canvassing issues in that regard; that is simply an objective statement. That conflict imprisoned Ministers and imprisoned creativity in this country while we worked that poison out of our system. I think in a different era Sir Paul would have made an even more notable contribution to our national affairs as external affairs Minister.

         He created history in Papua New Guinea and he created history in our relationship with the Aboriginal people. I think he would have had an opportunity to change the history of this nation on two other occasions. One such occasion would have been if the Liberal Party had elected him Prime Minister at the time he stood for that office. It may well have introduced a very different political history in the 1970s. We may have had an even more different political history in the 1970s if he had continued as Governor-General.

So, I am not sure to the extent that it was his decision that he did not do so. I think probably very substantially, it was. For us on this side of the House, it is probably a very great shame if that were to be the case. Had he continued, then the political history of this country would have been very substantially different.

         The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has focused on his contribution to intellectual and political life and to the liberal tradition in this country. I would like to reflect on the man who has commanded the respect of such a broad spectrum of Australian society. Much has already been said about the world in which he grew up, the community to which he belonged, and the conditions which helped shape Hasluck, the individual. In his autobiography, Sir Paul stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The real nature of a man does not change very much from the time when he was a boy. See the youth clearly and you see the grown manâ€”the real man underneath the trappings.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was true of Hasluck. As a boy growing up in a devout salvationist family he was taught that it was sinful to be self-centred and he was inculcated with a strong sense of obligation to help others. That sense of duty became an undiscriminating obligation to work for others, not for himself. His love of literature, the bush and animals, especially horses, as well as this strong sense of duty, were constant threads that were interwoven into the fabric of his long, sturdy and varied lifeâ€”both public and private.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As I reflect on that life, there are many areas of undeniable achievement. His lifelong commitment to Aboriginal people began with a fascination of their history through his first readings of anthropology, curiosity about legends, and an interest in Aboriginal place names. I believe that it was his overriding sense of fairness and compassion that drew him towards examining the conditions of Aborigines in the early 1930s. This early work formed the foundation for his masters thesis and was later published as a book titled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Black Australians
         </emphasis>
         . Because of wartime conditions, only 600 copies were ever printed and today it is a rare and sought after book. As Minister for the Interior, his work with and for Aborigines must be seen in the context of the time. Hasluck said of that period:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We grew up in a place and in a period when conflict was over and reconciliation and absorption had apparently begun. We did not think or talk about race conflict.
       </para>
       <para>
        His hope was that Aboriginal people would take part as Australians in shaping the future of Australia and would benefit from it in the same degree as all other Australians. In his work for Aboriginal people he was, above all else, a social reformer. He strove for the full recognition of their entitlementsâ€”legally as citizens and socially as fellow Australians. However, it was in other areas that Hasluck considered he had made his greatest achievements. According to his son, Nick, it was in three areas that Sir Paul considered he had made his greatest contribution.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The first was his work at the United Nations which, I believe, has been greatly underestimated. It included planning Australian policies in the postwar period, as well as being involved as a senior member of Evatt's staff in drawing up the charter of the UN at the San Francisco conference.

         Secondly, as Minister for the Territories from 1951 to 1963, he prepared Papua New Guinea for independence. Faced with formidable problems of welding numerous diverse interests into a cooperative framework, he laid the foundations for the future independent administration, promoted indigenous agriculture, and established primary education throughout the country. Whilst some have criticised his administration as paternalistic, the fact that transition to independence was achieved smoothly was in no small measure the result of his detailed knowledge, and diligent and careful administration.

         The third area that Sir Paul considered to be his greatest contribution was in his two volumes of the Australian war history,

          The Government and the People 1939-1945
         </emphasis>
         . Hasluck considered a study of history a means by which society may arrive at an understanding of what it is. Hasluck's graphic account of that period of our history illustrates our emergence as a nation. His published works reflect the standard of excellence that he maintained throughout his life, whether it was as the probing young journalist, the meticulous and diligent administrator, or the patient and methodical amateur carpenter.

         Hasluck had been influenced by the writings of Montaigne in his early twenties and, although he certainly never contemplated politics then, much of Montaigne's philosophy formed the basis of his political tenet. He cared not what he was in the opinion of others but, rather, what he was in his own opinion. That offers a possible explanation as to why he did not lobby on his own behalf for the prime ministership after the death of Harold Holt. Hasluck also confided that Montaigne `put him out of tune with most of those with whom I had to play. I suffered from a lack of enthusiasm at kicking someone else in the guts'. Hasluck said:

        Nick Hasluck, in his farewell message at the service for his father, referred to his father's love of the sweet simplicities of lifeâ€”his love of poetry, of music, of horses. Nick quoted a passage from Sir Paul's autobiography, recalling childhood experiences at their impact on the young Paul. He quoted these words:

        Much of my emotional life since I have grown up has been part of a search to recapture that sense of peace that I had in the bush as a small boy, to feel again the intimacy with the whole existence and to know the quietness and serenity that in an adult is the nearest we can come to the love and innocence of a child.

         I not only served in the Parliament with Paul Hasluck but also was fortunate enough to follow him, although not immediately, in two portfolios: territories, which was external territories when I held it, and external affairs, which was foreign affairs when I held it. My year in 1972 in my second portfolio of external territories was quite a frantic one. We were moving as fast as we could to get Papua New Guinea on the road to independence, transferring administrative and legislative functions very rapidly. Paul Hasluck was the Governor-General and, fortunately, I would see him at Executive Council meetings. Naturally, he took a personal interest after so many years of nurturing and giving a foundation to Papua New Guinea. I heard a remark made from someone on my side who was surprised when the Minister referred to colonial ties. Of course, we were colonial masters of that territory and the role of the Minister was almost that of a benevolent dictator. Certainly in my dayâ€”although not in Paul Hasluck's dayâ€”the Minister was preparing to work himself out of a job and preparing a territory to reach nationhood. The Minister was aware that he was virtually in total control of a nation.

I had been told and had read of the alleged pomposity and inflexibility of this man, who, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has rightly said, had he not come into this place would have been remembered for the enormous contributions he made in all the fields of human endeavour that he pursued. He sought me out in my second month here and asked me if I had come to understand the layout of Canberra. He drove me around Canberra in the old Peugeot that he used to drive to workâ€”no Commonwealth car for him. He explained to me even then that his thoughts were that, if this interminable committee which was examining a so-called permanent Parliament House ever reached finality, he would love to have the Parliament located near the lake so that it was closer to the people. There was none of this stuff up on hills for him; it was to be a part of the people.

I assumed I would be in the old Peugeot, but it turned out I had to ride a horse with him.

Even though one part of the intellectual process led him to feel that there should be a move to examine this, he felt compelled, if Australia had a destiny in this part of the world, to stick with those with whom he associated and wanted Australia to associate. We voted against the motion not because he did not think it was right but because he wanted to stand foursquare with the countries of our own region. That is hardly inflexibility.

         Reference has been made to the fact that he would not connive. It is well known that when my predecessor retired as Prime Minister there were two candidates for the deputy leadership. One was adept with the telephone and the otherâ€”Paul Hasluckâ€”was not. Paul lost by two or four votes. I was in here for the leadership battle which followed on the disappearance of Harold Holt. On this occasion he did do something: he wrote a simple one-page letter to all members. Most of us here are used to the telephone being used on these occasions, but there was no use of the telephone by Paul Hasluck. It was a simple, short, pithy statement setting out why he believed he could lead the party. I think he probably felt that was a fairly undignified exercise but, nevertheless, it was done.

         Honourable members will gather from the simplicity of these remarks that I had enormous admiration for this man. Anyone who knew him could not help but be moved by the sheer force of his quiet but constructive arguments and his personality. When I read what the Parliamentary Library distributed today as a record of him, I saw references to this recluse figure; this rather arrogant person with a pompous manner and inflexible nature. In 1964, when he was interviewed on assuming the portfolio of external affairs, he said that he found it interesting that his experience had taught him that most public reputations are false; that men are criticised for the wrong faults or praised for the qualities they do not have. At that time that comment was certainly apt so far as Paul Hasluck was concerned.

         Paul Hasluck was an immensely proud Australian. He was a critic of what he saw, particularly of the forms of plagiarism that were intruding into this countryâ€”simply borrowed from overseas. He was a forthright regionalist, as was Casey before him, with his absolute stress on our relationship with South-East Asia in particular. It is true that he was a stickler for detail in the administration of his department, as I later learned from officers who worked with me. And he was a stickler even to his death. The two of us had dinner in Melbourne some 18 months ago. He had enjoyed or was about to enjoy the fellowship of a man he admired greatlyâ€”Peter Ryan, a former editor of Melbourne University Press, who I do not believe I have seen since the days when the

         Paul also said that he had prepared and indexed all his files and records for his family so that there would be no problem should anyone wish to ascertain his viewsâ€”perhaps on anybody, although I am not too sureâ€”after his death.

I think it is important that in this House we understand that the change of generations began long before the election of Deputy Speaker Jenkins to his office tonight or, indeed, his election to this Parliament. To my mind, it began at the beginning of the second half of this century. Nobody articulated the change and its implication for Australia and our future better than the late Sir Paul Hasluck. I knew him in my service with him in this Parliament up to the time of his appointment as Minister for External Affairs, throughout his period as Minister for Defence, and as Governor-General.

         As others have suggested, the three areas in which he prided himself most in his service as a Minister were: certainly the role he played in the United Nations working on the staff of Dr Evatt in helping to draft the charter of the United Nations; secondly, the role he played as Minister for Territories in the evolution of what was an extraordinarily primitive country, emerging from the Stone Age, Papua New Guinea, and in assisting the progress of that nation towards self-government; and, thirdly, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) has said, his role with the Aborigines.

I have had a full and a happy life. I have had a rewarding life. I have been able to achieve all those things that I set out to do'.

        Sir Paul referred so much in this place, and personally, to the world he saw around him. I remember the many occasions in Cabinet in which, evoking some of those concerns that he had both as Minister for Territories and Minister for External Affairs, we would have major arguments whenever any suggestion was made of any cutting of the Government's aid budget. He felt very strongly about the role and responsibility we had. Just as he saw Australia as an evolving nation of people who had begun with very little, achieving so much, he felt that in the same way we had a responsibility to help others do the same.

         Much has been said by his biographer and by others as to the disciplined nature of the man. I would have to attest that he was a very disciplined person in his own life, and he expected no less than that of every officer that served under him. In fact an apocryphal story can be told about how he instructed his department as to how a ministerial or Cabinet submission should be designed. I assure the House: woe betide any person who submitted a submission which was not, down to the last comma and the last full stop, fully in accordance with the dictates of the Minister; it was simply sent back with some rude comment and the person was told to do it again.

         In that context, it is worth noting that while there has been a tendency in recent times perhaps to rewrite the history of the 1960s and the 1970s in terms of who got to Asia first and what specific position was adopted by previous governments and Ministers, I want to lay quite clearly on the record the fact that Paul Hasluck was absolutely an Australian. He believed in the need for Australia to create and to build for itself and its future closer links with the Asia-Pacific region. It is also worth noting, however, as is quite clearly written in the numerous works following his retirement, that he also believed that, for a nation with such a small population and with what he would have described as a fairly fragile historical and sociological grip on its sense of history, there were very real risks in being drawn into an environment where the strength of other cultures could easily swamp the nevertheless growing, and hopefully one day strong, unique Australian cultural tradition.

         On the final night we had a dinner. Sir Paul had invited all the cabinet of Sri Lanka from the Prime Minister down. In a terrible moment for me the Minister for Health said to Paul Hasluck, `I hope you know that your third secretary is quite fluent in our language'. At that stage, I wanted to slip out the door. Paul Hasluck looked down the table and said, `Connolly, when we finish dinner, you will get up and give us a speech in Singhala'. I spent the next half an hour without eating anything, having an absolute panic as to what I was going to say. Having decided what I wanted to say, Sir Paul then stood up at the end of dinner and said, `You are now going to give us a dissertation for at least 10 minutes on Australia's foreign aid policy to Ceylon', which was not the subject that I had been trying to get on top of for the last 30 minutes.

         That incident demonstrated his determination to ensure that Australia was seen to be professionally active, supportive and capable of demonstrating a uniquely Australian presence in the Asia-Pacific region. He played a key role in setting the foundation stones of a tradition which has been built upon since then by various governments, and certainly various Ministers for foreign affairs. As a great Australian, he undoubtedly played a key role in building up Australia's status in the Asia-Pacific region.

        Professor Fred Hollows's enormous contribution to Australia and the world in the field of ophthalmology will be long remembered, and it is only fitting that we honour him today through this condolence motion. He joins those few other special Australians who have been similarly honoured in this House.

         Fred Hollows was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 9 April 1929. In his early years he thought he might become a minister of religion or perhaps a psychologist. It was not until he was offered a place at the University of Otago to study medicine, at the age of 22, that he first thought seriously about a medical career. He became interested in eye surgery and, having completed his medical degree in 1961, he travelled to Britain for postgraduate study in ophthalmology. He spent some time working in Wales before coming out to Australia in 1965 to head the ophthalmology department of the University of New South Wales. With his urging, it was not long before there was a separate eye clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital.

         By this stage Fred Hollows had adopted Australia as his home and his work with Aboriginal people, for which he was to become so well known, had begun. First there was the establishment of the Aboriginal Medical Centre at Redfern in 1971. This centre became a model for many such establishments around Australia. Then followed the national trachoma and eye health program, under the auspices of which Professor Hollows and his team travelled the length and breadth of the country, treating sight impaired Aborigines.

         In two years 105,000 people in 465 locations were examinedâ€”which is a pretty amazing figure. Fifteen thousand Aboriginal people took part in treatment programs, which is again an amazing figure, and one thousand operations were performed. It was, I understand, one of the world's most extensive public health studies and is used as a benchmark in the public health care area. Later he extended his program internationally and established clinics in Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Vietnam and Eritrea. His aim was not merely to train local doctors in eye surgical techniques but to build factories to make the intra-ocular lenses required for effective treatment. This fellow never did anything by half-measures.

         Professor Hollows saw this as the only way of ensuring that Third World blindness would be adequately combated; he was not simply relying upon other members of the medical profession to learn the techniques but he actually set up the mechanism whereby these lenses would be produced. His dream of establishing these facilities and dealing with Third World blindness is now well on its way to being realised, with lens factories soon to be in operation in Vietnam, Nepal and Eritrea.

         Fred Hollows had many honours and awards bestowed on him over the years: Australian of the Year, Australian Humanist of the Year, the Australian Human Rights Medal, Companion of the Order of Australia, and several honorary degrees. A Nobel Peace Prize nomination is in preparation. But personal recognition mattered little to him. He was very much more concerned with getting the job done, with creating change and making people take notice of what was happening, both in their own backyards and the world at large. As one newspaper said in its obituary:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In many ways Professor Hollows was the conscience of Australia: challenging people by his own example to lead more selfless and dynamic lives; confronting us all with some of the uncomfortable truths about ourselves and our behaviour.

        Fred Hollows was a passionate man with deeply held convictions. Those who knew him or got near him would soon find themselves being told exactly what he thought about things and what he thought they should think about things. I think it was the strength of his commitment and passion which was so attractive to so many people. To his patients he was unfailingly generous and compassionate, but he was also forthright and his methods often unorthodox in order to achieve what he wanted. As he said in his autobiography:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        If it helps real living people, then I am not going to worry about professional decorum, good taste or anything else.
       </para>
       <para>
        On many occasions he could never have been accused of good taste, but he certainly got the job done. My colleague the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) showed me a book in which Fred Hollows said, `I am not exactly the smooth doctor type'. That was definitely right. There was not much smooth about him, but there was a lot strong about him.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Bureaucrats, colleagues and, of course, politicians were all fair game in this process. When he wanted something done, he mostly went and did it, and anyone who got in his way discovered what a powerhouse he was. In his own words:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . having a care and concern for others is the highest of the human qualities. It distinguishes us from the animals and deserves to be paid more attention and to be more exercised.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think this is probably the creed by which he lived. Anyone who is familiar with his career will know of the time he spent away from hospitals, the comfort of the urban environment and his home in outback Australia. He worked unselfishly amidst poverty in other countries often and for long periods. There is no doubt that he gave credence to the words I have just quoted him as uttering. It was this care and concern for his fellow man that drove him all his life, as a result of which many thousands of people are now able to see and many more thousands are given a chance to see. I could not imagine a greater reward than taking someone who was blind and restoring his sight, and to have done it for many thousands is pretty unusual.

       <para first-indent="16">

         He was loved by his family and friends and held in the highest esteem by his colleagues both here and overseas. It is a sad loss to us all. One wonders how the spark of such a dynamic life can be snuffed out, but this is the terrible tragedy of cancer today. As a result, this huge, dynamic force is no longer with us, but we remember him. I am sure that the good work he began will be continued in the same spirit and with the same dedication through the Fred Hollows Foundation, which is, of course, pursuing the objectives which he had during his life, particularly in setting up intra-ocular lens factories around the world and giving communities in various countries which are beset by these diseases of the eye the chance of restoring the sight of many thousands of people. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his wife Gabi and her family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

         â€”With the death of Fred Hollows, Australia and the world lost a man of rare competence, great compassion and genuine humility. But through the life of Fred Hollows we all directly or indirectly gained a greater insight into what humanity is truly all about. Fred Hollows was many things to many people. To the hundreds of thousands of Aboriginal men, women and children he helped with the eye disease trachoma, Fred Hollows was a saviour; he gave them back their sight. As one man was moved to say at Fred's burial site:

        To thousands of Eritrians suffering horrible eye diseases and wounds as a result of the war with Ethiopia, Fred Hollows, a man of peace, waged a personal war against blindness and won many battles. The intra-ocular lens factories he began to build in Africa to combat blindness will stand as towering monuments to Fred's ability to help people beat the odds. To a nation of people here in Australia, Fred Hollows was a real hero who was truly loved and, if he was not loved, he was always respected and admired.

         He was not only loved for his brilliant work; he was loved for who he wasâ€”a genial larrikin, a controversial but humble man, a man who did not suffer fools gladly and who called it how he saw it. Above all else he was a family man and a decent bloke by the best Australian standards by which that is measured. He was a man who devoted his life to helping others and, through that, challenged us all to reassess our own views of the world. As Jack Waterford wrote in the

        At some stage or another most of us here have been kicked up the backside by Fred. He never did it to hurt us; rather, he did it to help us help others. He rarely accepted no for an answer but he often said no to bureaucratic red tape, the political and economic jargon and excuses that were offered up to the so-called insurmountable problems, particularly in the public health arena.

         Fred Hollows had a genuine lust for life. Even when he was stricken with cancer he wanted to instil that lust into everyone he came in contact with. He rightly believed that enriching people's lives was possibly the greatest single contribution anyone could make. These were some of the qualities that set Fred Hollows apart from the rest of us. He was an exceptionally special human being.

I attended the memorial service at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney where, on any measure, the full spectrum of Australian society was represented. It reaffirmed to me how great a man Fred Hollows was.

        We all have our own personal reflections on our experiences with Fred Hollows. I remember the first time I met him. I happened to be in Hobart at the same time as he was there. He had been a guest speaker, I think at an insurance convention or something like that. He used to take every opportunity to get his point of view across. I saw him at the cocktail party they were having in the foyer of the Sheraton Hotel in Hobart and I went across and introduced myself to him. `I have been wanting to meet you', he said. Immediately he took control and dominated the conversation. He ignored his hosts for quite some time. There are a number of things that I remember about that particular meeting; it was characteristic of so many other meetings with Fred Hollows. I remember the intensity and directness of his cross-examination. He really went after you when he wanted to make a point or find out where you stood.

         I was impressed by the sense of urgency in his actions and in his voice. At that stage he did not have a lot of time. He was not going to waste a second and he was not going to let anyone else waste a second. That lust for life that I mentioned just oozed out. It was genuinely hard to avoid getting caught up in that particular lust for life.

         It is also appropriate that we honour Fred Hollows in the International Year of the Indigenous People as well as in our ongoing process of reconciliation with the Aboriginal community. No one man could have done more to help Aboriginal people improve their health standards and overall wellbeing than Fred Hollows. No one man, through his words and actions, could have demonstrated to the rest of us the importance of ensuring that the process of reconciliation, if it is to work, must involve all Australians, because we all have a role to play. We must make this process of reconciliation work so that we can see real improvements, not only in the awareness and understanding of Aboriginal culture throughout the wider community, but also in their standards of health, education, literacy, housing and employment opportunities.

We owe that to ourselves; we owe that to our indigenous people; and we most certainly owe that to Fred Hollows.

         Like most Australians, I have read much about Fred Hollows and, like most Australians, I have been absolutely inspired by his life. I met Fred Hollows only once, in the company of Mr Tim McCartney-Snape, previously of Meekatharra, now of Bowralâ€”and formerly of the top of Mount Everest, twice. I thought there was a lot of similarity between Tim McCartney-Snape and Fred Hollows in their vigour, their vitality, their determination, their dedication and their effort to make a point, move on and be mindful of time. The occasion on which I met Fred Hollows was a fundraising one for the eye health program in the Himalayas for the people of Nepal. On meeting Fred Hollows I was immediately struck by his fierce determination, his no-time-wasting approach and  manner, and  his absolute  desire  to  be helpful to so many others who are suffering so much.

         There is another aspect of Jack Waterford's writings which I think I should place on the record of the House on the occasion of this condolence motion for Fred Hollows. He said this about each person who attended the funeral:

        Obviously that speaks volumes for the charisma, energy and the magnetic personality of Fred Hollows. Previous speakers have spoken in detail about his work with the Aboriginalsâ€”and I salute that workâ€”his work overseas and his work everywhere to make life better for so many people. He is also well known for his strong views on a wide variety of controversial issues; these were built on his knowledge of medicine and his work as a doctor in many fields.

         His establishment of the national trachoma program resulted in the treatment of over 100,000 Aboriginals in the first two years of operation and set new benchmarks in this country with regard to rural community medicine. Later this winter I hope to visit the Alcoota Aboriginal property in the Northern Territory to see first-hand some of the work that has carried on from what began with the original Fred Hollows program.

         Fred Hollows's other magnificent achievement was his efforts in Eritrea. I guess that in this year of Fred Hollows's death it is worth more than passing comment that Eritrea will formally become a separate nation after the huge battles in the Ethiopian civil war. It must be remembered that during this time in Eritrea his cancer had been diagnosed. As Tom Keneally points out, even for the healthy travelling into Eritrea to do eye surgery was a hard journey full of delays and frustrations, and it must have involved personal hardship and agony of extraordinary proportion for Fred Hollows.

         In short, Fred Hollows was an absolutely fearless man. No doubt there would be a whole raft of issues on which I would not agree with what Fred Hollows believed; however, he was totally fearless in poking holes at society's conventional wisdom. I well remember the outrage which was heaped on Fred Hollows when he made some comments of absolute commonsense regarding aspects of the dreadful AIDS epidemic. He said that it is a simple truism that AIDS is predominantly a problem resulting from homosexual sex and that promoting safe sex is a blunt weapon compared with a more specific program aimed at the sexual practices which are highly likely to result in AIDS. This brought upon Fred Hollows an avalanche of criticism. His views were not part of the trendy conventional wisdom and politically correct attitude which tends to dominate, and therefore there was a well engineered and quite hysterical campaign to deny those undeniable aspects of Fred Hollows's comments.

         I do not agree with all that Fred said, but I must say that Fred Hollows spoke out without fear, with selflessness, as an enigmatic humanitarian whose life shone above the average, above the conventional and above the staid. He had a benchmark against which we can all measure our own failures, our own selfishness and our own narrowness.

         I met Fred Hollows on two or three occasions. I especially remember the occasion on which he and I travelled to Alice Springsâ€”I think it was in April of last yearâ€”when he gave an address which became very controversial. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has just referred to some of the comments that Fred Hollows made at that time. I recall him knocking out his pipe before he left the airport lounge, proceeding to the aircraft, ordering himself a bottle of his favourite liquid and launching into a conversation that lasted for something like four hours. The conversation literally covered the world but particularly focused on the passions that had driven Fred Hollows's life for so many years.

         As we passed over one area, Fred looked out of the window of the planeâ€”I could not see too much myselfâ€”and identified an extremely remote Aboriginal community that he had visited. He explained to me how many eyes he had had to do in that particular town, but he also went on to talk about the town's social structure and the way in which he felt that that community could make progress. I remember him going on for some time about what more could be done in the Alice Springs region. He suggested that I should be getting on the phone to the Army and setting up a field hospitalâ€”he did not have a great deal of faith in the hospital at Alice Springs being able to do the work on the scale that he thought was neededâ€”with an operating theatre where he would be able to do so many eyes. He thought it was all possible, providing we could get the red tape and the bureaucracy out of the way in order to tackle the problem and reach the important end, which was to ensure that people who had partial sight had their sight restored.

         In one sense, he was an engineerâ€”someone who had all of the precision and the capacity not only to design his instruments but also to be a brilliant surgeon. He operated on so many fronts: in the most remote parts of Australia, which are remote by any country's standard, in Eritrea and in so many other countries. He was a person who had achieved so much and who was driven by his sense of the future. The project that his wife, together with his foundation, now carries on in Vietnam is simply built upon his earlier work.

         We had in Fred Hollows a very special person. He could be vicious, brutal and tough, but at the same time he had amazing compassion. Full of contradictions, he was nevertheless someone who had a sense of missionary purpose. For someone who described himself as a humanist, he seemed to be driven by an almost religious passion to achieve a better world. In the biography of Fred Hollows by Peter Corris, Fred told the author:

        Fred came initially from Dunedin. His father was an engine driver, and no doubt in his background there was a mixture of the religious traditions associated with the Church of Christ and a kind of Christian socialism that had been present in Britain in the latter part of the 19th century, which no doubt translated to a place like Dunedin in the southern part of New Zealand.

One of the men to whom the motions have been directed was precise, urbane, cogent and modest to the point of self-effacement while the other was blunt, rambunctious, an ardent practitioner of the colloquial and controversial; but both men shared an overriding sense of compassion and both were imbued with a driving force to use their professional skills to the betterment of the disadvantagedâ€”in particular, Aboriginal Australians disadvantaged in our society. Neither confined his talents to our national border. Both were highly regarded as ambassadors for this country, each in his own field of expertise.

         I would like to talk briefly about Professor Hollows's medical and scientific career. He was a kiwi. He was trained at the University of Otago in Dunedin. Even today, the University of Otago maintains a reputation as possibly the finest ophthalmological school in Australia and New Zealand. At the time Professor Hollows graduated it was not possible to obtain a fellowship in Australia. It was not until 1969 that one could train as a specialist ophthalmologist in Australia; so Fred, along with a lot of other Australians and New Zealanders, had to go to London to do his fellowship. As part of his post-fellowship study, he took part in an epidemiological study in 1960 in Wales into the prevalence of glaucoma in the community. This remains, 30 years later, a benchmark study on the prevalence of one particular disease in a whole community. It started people talking about glaucoma and it set in train a forward planning of resources to treat glaucoma that is still relevant today.

         After he finished his fellowship in England, Fred Hollows was actually offered a chair in ophthalmology in Kenya. I imagine he must have sought thisâ€”it it is unlikely to have been offered without being soughtâ€”but in the end he was unable to accept it because of the potential political unrest at the time.

         He came to New South Wales and took up a position at the Prince of Wales Hospital. He initially threw himself into the investigation of diabetic retinopathy; that is, the disease that affects the retina, the back of the eye, the thing that actually sees, which can affect people with diabetes. Thirty years ago it was the major cause of blindness in people aged 20 to 50. It is still a very major cause of blindness in this country. Fred and his team at the Prince of Wales Hospital very quickly became experts in the treatment of this disease. They were among the first people in the world to use laser therapy to treat diabetic retinopathy and Fred Hollows became a world recognised expert in the treatment of the disease.

         In the early 1970s his life was to change, and he became a founding member of the Redfern Aboriginal Medical Service. It is a curious fact that this was the second great Aboriginal controlled organisation in the country, the legal service having predated it. As a member of the medical profession, always wondering which was the oldest profession in society,  I thought for a long time ours was the second oldest, but after the lawyers I am now sure we are the third.

         In the mid to late 1970s the Prince of Wales Hospital, largely under Fred's guidance, began outreach work and moved into western New South Wales, particularly the area around Bourke, and this began a long association with that area. They travelled every three months to provide basic eye care to the communityâ€”not just the Aboriginal community, but the whole community, both black and white. As a result, 105,000 people were examined in 465 different places. There were 1,000 operations and 15,000 Aboriginal people were looked after. Fred's dissatisfaction with the standard of medical care available to anybody at that time led him to try and convert his professional organisation, the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists, to taking some pro-active stance on the issue of trachoma.

         Fred was not alone in this, although he is the person it is identified with. There were many others who were involved, one of whom is a former member of this Parliament, Peter Baume, who at the time was a junior opposition backbencher. He was instrumental in persuading the college to get private medical practitioners to make a real commitment to public healthâ€”and they did. That was the trachoma program. Trachoma is a very old disease; it may have even predated European settlement. It might have been brought in by Macassans or Malaysians. It was known to the pioneers of Australia as sandy blight. It was something that affected people wherever there were poor living conditions.

         If one looks at the colonial history of Australia, one sees that sandy blight was a particular problem to colonial Australians, but it died out by the early twentieth century. It was only when people started to look at it again in the 1950s and 1960s that they found that in some parts of central Australia 90 per cent of Aboriginal people over 15 years of age were affected by a preventable infectious disease that would cause them to go blind in one or both eyes.

         This pricked Fred's sense of outrage, and the national trachoma program followed from that. Fred became a leading authority on the assessment and treatment of Third World eye diseases. I guess it is not surprising that it followed from that that his work moved on into similar Third World countries. It is something that all of us should reflect on here tonight. We are talking about a person becoming an expert on Third World diseases in Australia, but one could still do it today. His work in Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma and Latin America followed that.

He was known for the fact that when he went to England he talked for a long time about what a great mountaineer he was and, as he came from New Zealand, everyone thought that this had to be true. For many years in London they talked about Fred's first expedition where he took a whole team away from the hospital. Fred insisted on detailed lists of supplies. They carried far more than they needed. The group was forced to trek with a very large burdenâ€”hammocks, primus stoves, everything that one could want. When they finally set up their camp for the night, and set up their stoves and it became time for tea, Fred's one contribution had to be the tea bag; and after having forced everybody to carry all this stuff the whole way, it turned out that Fred had forgotten the tea.

So Fred decided to whip him into shape; he gave him a very hard time and kept on his back to try to force the best out of him. One day at the Prince of Wales Hospital, in front of around 150 patients, this registrar had the misfortune of missing a very minor part of an examination, and in front of the whole outpatients clinic Fred abused this guy for missing something quite minor. He said he was an absolute imbecile; blind; had no facility with his hands, they did not work at all; and he should not be a doctor. Fred then turned around to the lady behind him and said, `And by the way, Mrs Smith, this is Dr Peters who is operating on you tomorrow'.

If we in this House really wanted to do something to commemorate Fred Hollows, perhaps, 10 years after the appearance of the HIV epidemic, we could actually take heed of some of the things he said. In his usual style he went a bit over the top, but the fact is that 10 years after the appearance of the epidemic we still do not have a nationally coordinated HIV program to prevent the spread of that virus in Aboriginal communities. Perhaps, if we wanted to do something to match some of the work of this man, we might set ourselves that task.

         The way that Fred Hollows came to be a supporter of the Aboriginal cause is itself an interesting story. Around 1967 the Gurindji people walked off the Wave Hill cattle station in an attempt, firstly, to draw attention to their right to award wagesâ€”they had been living in quite appalling conditionsâ€”but the campaign quickly grew into one of the first public struggles by Aboriginal people in this country for their land.

         Fred Hollows, who had had no previous experience with Aboriginal people, went along to a meeting at the teachers federation building in Sydney. A bucket was passed around in the course of the evening and Fred Hollows donated in the order of what would now be $300 or more to the cause. When the organisers of the public meeting went through the bucket and found this cheque, they were somewhat nonplused. Those of us who have been battling on the side of good causes would know that donations of that magnitude are somewhat unusual and are to be warmly welcomed and endorsed. Soon after that, some of the organisers of the meeting sought out this person who had written the cheque, and of course it was Fred Hollows. Again, soon after that, he went to Wave Hill with some of the organisers of that protest meeting, including Frank Hardy.

         A wonderful song has since been written about the Gurindji's struggle for land rights. It is by a singer named Paul Kelly and it says that from little things big things grow. In fact, it was because of that meeting in Sydney that Fred Hollows became involved in the Aboriginal people's struggle for their rights. The Prime Minister has recorded how, from that small beginning, the trachoma program became an extraordinary organisational effort in logistics and in commitment by doctors in addressing the conditions in which Aboriginal people lived and in treating their eye disease.

         The statistics are quite extraordinary. Between 1976 and 1979 the program travelled hundreds of thousands of kilometres, visiting more than 500 rural Aboriginal communities and also treating Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. It examined, in total, 110,000 people or more; up to 800 different types of pathology were recorded and 18,000 pairs of spectacles were prescribed. Thirty thousand Aboriginal people were treated in the mass treatment trachoma programs.

He would not want anyone to leave this chamber tonight thinking that the solution to Aboriginal health and medical problems, or any other issue confronting indigenous people in this country, lies in the hands of non-Aboriginal Australians. If there was one thing that Fred Hollows believed in it was that the solutions to problems experienced in Aboriginal communities would not come from well-intentioned politicians or doctors, but only from Aboriginal people themselves being in control of their own community organisations and shaping programs that would address those problems. He greatly championed that cause all the time he worked with Aboriginal people.

I am sure he would be the first to agree that he was none of those things. In fact, in many respects he was a wildly passionate man; someone with an irrepressible character who was likely to manifest that irrepressible character in the most extraordinary waysâ€”not the least of which was the means by which he acquired a large part of the infrastructure for the trachoma program. Honourable members will see from his autobiography that one way he acquired the material for the program was simply by taking it, because he regarded the higher cause of giving sight to people who would otherwise remain blind as the dominant principle.

         One other extraordinary exploit is referred to in his autobiography, and since it happened in my electorate I ought to refer to it briefly. During the time when the Gurindji campaign was gaining momentum there was a considerable degree of surveillance, believe it or not, by ASIO. Fred Hollows became aware of this surveillance and he became very angry. He decided to lash out against what he saw as this system which was stacked against those who were trying to struggle for the most basic human rights for indigenous people in this country. So he went to the Royal National Park at Sutherland where, at the entrance, there were some very big commercial billboards. He admits in his autobiography that his action was quite irrational, but it was his reaction to the treatment that he felt he was getting from ASIO and the government of the day.

         I would like to pay tribute to him for the way he helped me, and I think helped this Parliament, during the time he was Australian of the Year. As people have repeatedly said, he was deeply committed to improving the living conditions of Aboriginal people in communities. We can build hospitals 10 miles high, but if people are living in conditions that are the root cause of ill health we are not really getting to the source of the problem.

This can only be done by improving housing, water and sewage disposal methodsâ€”those gutsy everyday things that Fred Hollows always spoke so passionately about.

I thought to myself tonight, `What would Fred Hollows think if he was sitting here now?'. I could probably make Australian parliamentary history by using Fred Hollows's language to tell honourable members what he would say but it would be unprintable, and since my seat is still relatively marginal and I am not confident about how it would be received in the wider community I will not do it. He would basically say, `There is a lot of talk and a lot of things being said, but if there is one thing that people ought to be about it is to do practical, positive things to get change and to address the issues that are important to indigenous people'.

         The Mabo decision is very much on the public policy agenda of the Government and the nation as a whole. If there is one thing that I hope people will take as a lesson from Fred Hollows to apply over the weeks and months ahead, it is that we have to have the courage to stand up for principles and to maintain the commitment to Aboriginal people to bring about the changes that are necessary. While there have been great advances for some Aboriginal people since the Gurindji struggle of the 1960s, it is a fact that the great majority of Aboriginal people are still not properly accorded respect and their rights to land. I hope the House will understand that I feel it is appropriate to make that point tonight.

         A great deal has already been said by those who have spoken, so I will not recapitulate at any length other than to say that when I became chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in early 1976, some of those great living legends of the Australian Parliament who were vitally interested in Aboriginal people, played a significant role over a long time. These great living legendsâ€”the Hon. W.C. Wentworth, the Hon. Kim Beazley, senior, the Hon. Gordon Bryant, and the Hon. Les Johnsonâ€”were all members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. They commented on matters in this area that might affect the future of Aboriginals in Australia.

         The impact that alcohol was having on Aboriginal communities was one matter that was very much on the mind of Bill Wentworth and Gordon Bryant. They persuaded Ian Viner that the first report that the Aboriginal Affairs committee should initiate should be on alcohol problems of Aborigines. It was only later in time that I became aware that this was of great disappointment to Fred Hollows, somebody at that stage whom I did not know. It was towards the end of that year that the committee was given another reference which was engineered by Kim Beazley, senior, and I think he was assisted in that by the then Minister for Health, the Hon. Ralph Hunt.

         The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs received a reference to inquire into the health conditions of Aboriginal people generally; that is, the prevalence of different types of diseases suffered by Aboriginals in Aboriginal communities, the relationship between health and environmental factors, between social and cultural factors, the effectiveness of existing health care programs, and alternative methods of health care delivery. I believe this was a reference that the committee received because Fred Hollows was of the view that we had it dreadfully wrong, and that we could only look at the particular symptom of alcohol abuse in the context of the wider circumstances that were impacting upon Aboriginal people. If we look at the report of the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists and at the national trachoma and eye health program, that becomes clear.

         The Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists had engaged the assistance of the Lions Club movement and was challenged, as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Wooldridge) mentioned, by former Senator Peter Baume to seek out private doctors to demonstrate their commitment to public health by action rather than words. This was a matter that the royal college took on, and Fred Hollows became very much the instigator. The report of the national trachoma and eye health program records that by early 1975 a plan had been prepared for the project to begin in 1976. The survey team was to be led by Professor Hollows, and screening was to be undertaken. The report later emphasises the involvement of Ralph Hunt, as the new Minister for Health in the Fraser Government, in bringing to fruition that program that was initiated and prepared in the twilight of the then Labor administration.

         Fred Hollows was a man for causes in many ways. I noticed that in many of the news reports he was described as a larrikin. He was certainly a person who made sure that everybody was very much aware of his views. In my role as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I certainly became aware of that and the impact of Fred Hollows can be seen in the recommendations of the committee. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) mentioned the importance of Aboriginal selfdetermination and the relevance of land to so many of the matters that impact upon the health profile of the Aboriginal community. All of these matters were highlighted in those reports at that time in a very positive and supportive way.

         In 1971 Fred Hollows was involved in the anti-apartheid demonstrations. His ambit was much wider. He was involved, as was mentioned, in the formation of the Aboriginal medical services. Although he was obviously a man, by conviction, from the left, he came in touch with people of all political persuasions and sought to bring all of them on board in relation to the issues that he saw as being of fundamental importance. In an article in the

I first met Fred Hollows when I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, which was chaired by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I subsequently had constant contact with himâ€”on occasions to receive his views and on many occasions to seek his advice. Whatever advice one got from Fred Hollows, it was essentially blunt, decisive, totally free of cant and often abrasive, but always directed to meet the benefit of those who needed his skill and medical devotion.

         The commitment of Fred Hollows to Aboriginal people has already been mentioned by my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). But it was more than just a devotion. Not only did he tend their medical needs but he was one of the early Australians of our generation who recognised the depth of Aboriginal culture, their relationship with the land, the deprivation of that faith and its effect upon their mental and physical health.

         Fred Hollows devoted himself to doing what he did best in the field of treating eye diseases. There he made a great contribution. But it should not be forgotten that on one occasion during that early period when Fred Hollows was working in the backblocks of Australia his work and that of his team was cut short by the political intervention of the then Bjelke-Petersen Government which felt that much of his work was directed at politicising Aboriginal communities. That was a political mistake which ought to be placed on the record. At that time not too many were voices raised in the parliaments of Australia for and on behalf of Fred Hollows.

         I was able to observe at first hand his relationship with Aboriginal people. On one occasion I was present with him when seeking to solve problems raised by an Aboriginal medical group. I felt that the group's particular approach and response to the problem were starting to be somewhat bureaucratic. While I was thinking of a polite way of indicating that perhaps there were other approaches, Fred proceededâ€”as only Fred couldâ€”with terminology which all of those present certainly understood and which would have been used around camp fires on many occasions, to tell his Aboriginal colleagues what he thought of their approach. What I found interesting was the way in which those very blunt and abrasive views were accepted. They were accepted for one reason: there was no doubt in any of their minds that this was a man who saw them as equals. There was no talking down to themâ€”he was talking to them as he would to any group of fellow Australians.

         On this occasion we are remembering the great contribution that Fred Hollows has made not just to Aboriginal people but to other indigenous people around the world. The buzz word used in political circles these days, when dealing with black-white relations in Australia, is reconciliation. If there is one man who lived the concept of reconciliation, it was Fred Hollows. He did not begin, as so many people in Australia do, with the view that Aboriginal people's problemsâ€”their medical and other problemsâ€”would be solved if only they would reconcile and be like us. The fact is that Aboriginal people have been trying to reconcile to a white-dominant society for over 200 years.

         Fred Hollows recognised that if there was ever to be reconciliation it would have to be on the basis of us understanding the depth and the nature of Aboriginal society and the contribution that Aboriginals were capable of making to a developing nation like Australia.

We will be indeed fortunate as a nation if we can build on their great concept of this large, imposing and sometimes terrifying land that we have a great responsibility towards.

My respect for, and my understanding of, Fred Hollows was enhanced considerably by what his great mateâ€”and a friend of mineâ€”Frank Hardy told me. Back in 1965, Frank Hardy was very largely the catalyst in the involvement of Fred Hollows in the Gurindji case at Wattie Hill. When Fred Hollows visited that site, a community of 150 people, he was devastated to discover that every child suffered from trachoma which is a preventable Third World disease.

         After the service I told Frank Hardy that he had probably delivered the greatest oration ever delivered in the cathedral. His response to me was, `I had to get it right for Fred.

         Fred Hollows allowed that service to take place in St Mary's Cathedral because of his love for Gabi and his respect for her deep Catholic faith. But for his own service he chose another place. It was conducted among people who travelled from Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Queensland and from all parts of New South Wales. There were Aboriginal people, some of whom had travelled hundreds of kilometres; there were relations, old school friends, colleagues, nurses and many more.

I do not think any former Minister or former shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs could let this event pass without going on record to note the extraordinary service of this very extraordinary man. He played such a real role not only in the establishment of the Aboriginal Medical Service but also, in particular, in his attack, his war, on glaucoma.

         I met Fred in the Northern Territory when I was a shadow Minister in the mid-1980s. It is fair to say, as others have said before me, that Fred did not suffer fools gladly. I am afraid he included parliamentarians among the fools. From his perspective, that was perfectly justified because he would say, `Look around you and see for yourself that you have spent all this money, yet have fundamentally failed to address some of these critical issues which affect the health and the wellbeing of your fellow citizen'. He used to take some exception to the fact that various aid organisations and church organisations from other countries were actually prepared to fund health programs for Australian Aborigines. His point always was that the Australian Government seemed to have some difficulty in being able to face up to the issues. Much has been said here tonight about the extraordinary work Professor Hollows did outside Australiaâ€”in Eritrea in particular, in Nepal, in Burma, in Bangladesh and, most recently, in Vietnam.

He had been in hospital on a number of occasions and was clearly unwell. Although on that occasion he had great difficulty actually speaking, he nevertheless did. He saw the urgency of the moment and he saw the need to get his point across to the audience, which was quite an influential audience, including a lot of people from the media who were funding the breakfast on that occasion.

         Professor Hollows told us quite clearly the basic philosophy for which he had lived and worked and why he wanted the Hollows Foundation to carry on the activities which he had already pioneered. Fundamentally, he believed that where we have skills, in whatever field they may be, those skills must be put to the benefit of humanity. He believed the transfer of technology and the techniques he had demonstrated in the areas of glaucoma and ophthalmology were fundamental. His goal as he saw it was that, if people were to be truly independent, obviously they could not achieve any form of independence if they could not see. To him, the most simple thing of all was to give people the right to sight.

         He told us then about the Wollongong factory in your electorate, Mr Speaker, where they were establishing kits, which he designed himself, to take out to these Third World countriesâ€”not in the sense of, `We are a rich country; here is aid, we want to help you'; he completely dissociated himself from that sort of attitude. The point he was making was that, by giving them the kits, the people themselves with training would be able to produce a technical material substantially cheaper than that which was being sold to those very same governments by the Americans or whoever it was that had the technology and the techniques. They would be able to develop their own techniques and eye mechanisms to help their people. That is what he wanted his foundation to continue to do, and that is what it has continued to do.

         At the most recent Australia Day awards, being a previous Australian Citizen of the Year, Fred was represented by his wife, Gabi. Fred was dying, yet there she was, representing him. She was always smiling. She showed remarkable self-control. Those who knew what Fred was all about knew that she and her family were totally dedicated to the ideals of this extraordinary man. As I said initially, I think it says volumes for Fred Hollows that he wanted to be buried on the claypan outside Bourke, the land that he loved, among the people whom he had done so much to help. I think that was the most moving epitaph of all.

         It is important to recall the words of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner).

         Everything Fred Hollows did in the Aboriginal community and, when he went overseas, in Eritrea, was committed to the principle that he would provide service to those who were less well off in the community but not seek to dominate, rather, to be their servant. He continued that practice in the Aboriginal Medical Serviceâ€”always working for Aboriginal controlled organisations. When he went to Eritrea his principal task was to train local medical practitioners so that they could carry on the work for which he initially provided the expertise.

         Finally, there is a line in poetry that is very appropriate for Fred. It speaks of his anger at blindness and the need to respond to the scourge in the Aboriginal communities where blindness was so dominant, whereas in our wider non-Aboriginal community it had all but been eradicated. It was written by a young man of his father, who was dying. He said, `Do not go gentle into that good night . . .  rage, rage against the dying of the light'. There are no stronger words that can be said of Fred Hollows than that for all of his life he raged against the dying of the light. Even in his last months he continued to live a vigorous life, raging against the dying of the light, and it is a beacon to all of us.

        Alfred Ashley-Brown was born on 5 October 1915 at Strathfield in New South Wales. He saw service in the Second World War with the 2nd AIF from 1942 to 1945, being discharged with the rank of major. Prior to entering the Federal Parliament, he had a long and distinguished career in local government in New South Wales. He was first elected as a councillor in the Seven Hills riding in 1959. He became the shire president the following year. In 1961, when Blacktown was proclaimed a municipality, Mr Ashley-Brown was the first mayor of the district, a position he held for a record seven years. In 1987 the Blacktown Council conferred on him the title of freeman of the city in recognition of his outstanding service to local government.

I remember that on one occasion he drove into the works depot at Blacktown in a cloud of dust, called me over and set about ticking me off over a team of men who were leaning on shovels and picks at the level crossing at Seven Hills. Blacktown at that time was a typical rural area that was surrounded with level crossings to most areasâ€”Riverstone, Schofields, Quakers Hill and Seven Hills. He said, `If you like working for the Blacktown council you had better get down there and stop those fellows because it is bad for the ratepayers to see people leaning on picks and shovels'. I dashed down in the ute and had a look at them. I came back about 40 minutes later, which was a pretty good record in those days. I thought,`I've got this fellow and it's early in my career. I have the mayor where I want him'. I went into his office and said, `Sorry, Mr Ashley-Brown, those fellows down there are railway fettlers. They don't work for the council and therefore I couldn't say anything about it'. He said, `I was just testing you out, Russ, to see how long it would take you to go down to Seven Hills, check the position there and then come back'. I was quite sure that I really had him by the toe, but he reversed the position on me without any problems whatsoever.

         As has been mentioned, Mr Ashley-Brown was the mayor of Blacktown. He had a reputation of good standing as an accountant with a large departmental store in Parramatta known as Murray Brothers. His service in the AIF was well known. He won the seat of Mitchell in 1972 from Les Irwin, who at that stage had retired from the Bank of New South Wales to go into politics. Les was elected at well over the age of 60 to begin a career lasting nine years in the Federal Parliament.

         Ashley-Brown was successful in the swing to Gough Whitlam in the `It's time' campaign in 1972. In 1974, two seats were won by the coalition; Mitchell was one. The 1974 economy was well on the move downwards, with the Whitlam extravagances and high interest rates cruelling it for young home buyers right throughout the western area of Sydney. Of course, there was also the Galston airport controversy. A colleague of mine, the then member for Parramatta, also benefited by the extraordinary decision that was so strongly held to by both the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and the Minister for Transport, Mr Charles Jones.

         Ashley-Brown had not realised the strength of feeling that there was in the hills district when Galston was announced as the site for the airport. People were very restive. There were many petitions, bus loads of people coming down to Canberra and that sort of thing. Gough Whitlam, as Prime Minister, really roused people up when he visited Baulkham Hills shire council during that period, and in response to a protest of mums and kids outside the front door of the council chambers swung round on them in rage and said, `You will get Galston'. Nothing could have made it harder for Ashley-Brown to win the 1974 election. At a rally of some 8,000 people on a cold winter's night in Galston Park, an impossible number of people to raise by any sheer political manipulation, Ashley-Brown's speech was made up of his saying over and over again, `An airport at Galston? You have got to be joking'.

         That was no consolation to the people who had assembled there. Ashley-Brown recognised that it was a very difficult decision to execute and could not see it coming to fruition, but failed to indicate that he would follow through and work on behalf of the residents of that area to reverse the Cabinet decision. So there was a change. We won that seat by some 600 votes at that time. I would like to pay tribute to a hardworking man of the Labor Party, who worked hard in local government, who was a good member of Federal Parliament and who at all times was a man of his word and a man of honour. I wish to extend my condolences to his family.

        Turgut Ozal will be remembered by his fellow Turks as an economic reformer who worked hard to consolidate democratic principles in Turkey. He also will be remembered as a close friend and ally of Australia. The late President was awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia in the course of his visit to Australia in 1971, in recognition of his efforts to develop relations between our two countries. In particular, Australia remembers Turgut Ozal with special affection for his role in organising the 75th Anzac commemoration at Gallipoli in 1990 and his part in the Turkish Government's decision to rename the landing place of the Anzacs at Gallipoli Anzac Cove.

         I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Ozal on a number of occasions during OECD negotiations. One year he was the presiding officer of the OECD and I was able to get some insight into his personality and the fact that he was in the last 25 years one of the significant people who had remodelled a complex economy and set a nation on a new course of integration with the rest of the world. He was a person of substance and I hope that all Australians and members of this House will join with me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at his death.

         â€”The Opposition fully supports the motion before the House and joins in conveying its sympathy to the Government and the people of Turkey following the death of President Turgut Ozal. President Ozal was Turkey's dominant political leader of the 1980s. He was also a very good friend of Australia. At a personal level I well recall the deep sense of reconciliation which President Ozal brought to the 75th anniversary commemoration of the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey just over three years ago. President Ozal played an important role in the planning of that commemoration and in the warm welcome which was extended to our Gallipoli veterans and to all those Australians who participated in that unforgettable event.

         The Gallipoli campaign created an enduring sense of nationhood, not just for Australia but also for Turkey, and it was very appropriate that reconciliation, friendship and comradeship were hallmarks of the 75th anniversary of the Anzac landings. The memorable success of those commemoration services at Anzac Cove in 1990 owes much to the hard work of many people in both Australia and Turkey and, in a special way, to the personal commitment shown by President Ozal.

         As Prime Minister for six years and President for three, Turgut Ozal was a controversial figure in his own country. It is not for us today, of course, to pass judgment on his political record, except to note that in key policy areas such as economic restructuring, trade arrangements, regional security and relations with the West, President Ozal pursued clear-cut policies which he believed were in Turkey's national interest. President Ozal committed Turkey strongly in support of the United Nations-led alliance that eventually drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1990, a commitment which, of course, Australia fully shared.

         I appreciated the opportunity to discuss some of these matters directly with President Ozal when he visited Australia two years ago. We differed on some important issuesâ€”notably the situation in Cyprus and the importance of respect for basic human rightsâ€”but it was a measure of the maturity of the bilateral relationship that we could discuss such differences in a direct and respectful way. President Ozal was well aware of the important economic opportunities that exist in Australia-Turkey relations, and it is our hope that his enthusiasm for making the most of such opportunities is sustained. The Opposition parties join with the Government in this condolence motion and we look forward to further strengthening the ties between Australia and Turkey.

         â€”It is with sadness that I rise to speak on the condolence motion for the former President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal. President Ozal was indeed a friend of Australia, as witnessed by his visit to Australia in 1991, a visit which included the Snowy Mountains scheme in the town of Khancoban in my electorate and also his appointment as an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia.

         I very much regretted the attitude and activities of groups within and without this Parliament to besmirch that honorary Companion of the Order of Australia given to President Ozal. I vividly remember the circumstances of that besmirchment. It was undeserving in all the circumstances and I commend former Prime Minister Bob Hawke for the steps he took in giving that honorary Companion of the Order of Australia award to President Ozal. It was richly deserved.

         President Ozal had a great influence on Turkey in continuing the work of modernising and westernising Turkey's political system. I guess many of us also gained more knowledge of Turkey during that period because it was a period in which Turkey was represented by Ambassador Ergun Pelit and he was very active in disseminating information ahead of the visit that many of us made to Turkey and Gallipoli in 1990.

         President Ozal also had a major influence on the opening up of debate in Turkey on issues which had been previously off limits due to the strong Islamic influences on Turkey. In many ways I suppose he could be likened to that former President and great Turk patriot, Ataturk. It is a matter of more than passing interest that it was the Australians' and New Zealanders' `unluck' that at the landing of Gallipoli, Ataturk was in command of the Turkish forces.

         On day one of that offensive the Australian and New Zealand forces actually made it to the top and over the other side where they could see the sea, and they held that high ground for several precious hours. But they were up against the one Turkish commander who recognised that by sunset he had to recapture that ground or the game was up and Turkey would be forced up the peninsula. Of course, Ataturk took every action he could and fought back on day one. In fact, he regained that high ground at that critical time on the occasion of 25 April 1915. The rest is history. Ataturk went on to become a moderniser and great President of Turkey and, indeed, President Ozal continued that work of modernisation.

         I can add only that President Ozal's elevation to the position of President is particularly interesting given current debates within Australia about certain matters. In passing, I point out that President Ozal's Motherland Party was in office in Turkey from 1983 to 1989. As his party became less popular in the late 1980s, the then Prime Minister Ozal had his parliamentary majority elect him as President in 1989, a situation which outraged the then opposition and which fundamentally changed the precedent until that time that presidents in Turkey were essentially non-political appointments. There is no doubt that President Ozal was a visionary nationalist and his free market prescriptions for Turkey's economy achieved much in further modernising Turkey.

         Lastly, President Ozal will be remembered for allowing allied planes to use strategic air bases within Turkey for operations against Iraq during the Gulf War. I had the good fortune of being on board the Australian naval ships during the blockade of Iraq, the Strait of Hormuz and elsewhere, and the air strikes, some of which commenced in Turkey, were a valuable part of that blockade. I think that was a particularly courageous and correct decision by President Ozal at that time.

He was involved in determined efforts to have Turkey admitted as a member of the European Economic Community.

         More important, of course, was his role in opening Turkey more forcefully to the West than had occurred hitherto. He was in a true sense a bridge to the West for the Republic of Turkey.

         Previous speakers have alluded to the question of civil rights in Turkey. One thing that must be said about Turgut Ozal is that he conquered his background. Born in central Turkey, coming from a very strong Islamic background, he originally ran as a candidate for one of the more conservative religious-based parties. After an education overseas, he was pushed into power as the Deputy Prime Minister of the military government of Turkey in 1980. I think it is testimony to his contribution to Turkey that he did overcome the reality that he had been put there by the Turkish military authorities and that during the liberalisation period that occurred after thatâ€”the lifting of marshal law and the plebiscite that ended the 10-year ban on former prime ministers and other political leadersâ€”he was at the helm when there was a strengthening again of civil liberties.

         The other important point to consider is his contribution in foreign affairs. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that in discussions with President Ozal he had indicated some disagreements over Cyprus. I think that is very true, but the reality is that the Cypriot solution has lost a very great friend in his death. Only today I was speaking to the representative of the Republic of Cyprus, who indicated a feeling that progress on that issue would possibly deteriorate because of his passing.

         I think we must also recall the central role he has played in European affairs over the last few years and particularly on the question of Bosnia. When the world has failed to come up with solutions, the one country that has very significantly pushed forward the cause of the Bosnian Moslems and, at the same time, attempted to deal with it in a very rational and sensitive way has been Turkey and its representatives around the world.

         President Ozal died after returning from a tour of central Asian republics and the former Soviet Union, an area where Turkey has been playing a leading role. He has played a central part in attempting to increase the ties between the Turkish speaking republics and the Turkish Government. Once again, on the Kurdish question, it is very difficult to say that one can totally agree with the Turkish Government's position or, for that matter, the Kurdish resistance, but I think the evidence is there that, no matter how critical one might be of certain activities of the Government, he has been a force of moderation. It has been argued that his departure will strengthen the hand of those who take a more hardline position. I join with other members in expressing sympathy at his departure.

         It is an absolute tragedy that since 1983 over 28,000 people have been killed as a result of the ongoing civil unrest within Sri Lanka between the Singhalese majority and the Tamil rebels in the north and the east of the country. President Premadasa's death was accompanied by the killing of another 17 people and a further 60 injured in what must have been an absolutely horrific bomb blast.

         It says much for Sri Lanka's first President, Mr J.R. Jayewardene, that he chose Premadasa despite his humble background over many others who laid claim to the presidency. He did so because he saw in Premadasa the potential to bring together the diverse political and ethnic forces which since the 1970s have done their best to destroy what used to be, when I was a child living there, one of the most contented and beautiful places on earth.

         By any yardstick Ranasinghe Premadasa was a tough politician. Some claimed that his methods were dubious. But in the hard politics of his country he carved out for himself a unique place. Unlike virtually all the senior politicians who had led his country since independence in 1948, he was not a Goyigamaâ€”that is, a member of the highest caste; they were mainly the landowners. He was a member of the Hinaya, or the washermen's caste, which was very low down the totem pole. He was a product of the villagers, of the labour movement, and was very much a man of the people.

         Premadasa's political support always rested with the low caste, the low income city and village dwellers.

         Premadasa in his time as President not only dealt firmly with the Marxist political extremists in the Singhala community, who tried to rule through the gun, urging them to come into the democratic process, but also endeavoured to open the way to constructive dialogue with the Ceylon Tamils whose claims to a separate state were the basis of the civil war which has racked that country for a decade. On many occasions he stated publicly that he would go anywhere at any time to talk peace. While he maintained military action against the rebels, he always saw political dialogue as an essential prerequisite to a peace settlement.

         The assassination of President Premadasa not only is an event of great concern to his own nation but also may have repercussions within the region. Unfortunately, this is just the latest in a long line of political assassinations in Sri Lanka. If this trend continues, it will hasten the collapse of the democratic institutions which have played an important part in endeavouring to hold the country together since 1948, despite the endemic ethnic animosities which have resulted over recent decades.

On that occasion I was most remiss in not joining the remarks of my worthy opponent, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), about the efforts of my predecessor, Ron Edwards, as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees in the previous parliament. I believe that, from the way he conducted himself both in his time as Deputy Speaker and on occasions as Acting Speaker, Ron earned great respect from all members on both sides of the House.

Although the Budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, that amount was not then appropriated. Funds are now required to meet increases resulting from award decisions  and $288.9 million is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies including Defence; an increase of 2.7 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). This amount includes the costs associated with agreed wage and salary increases, transfers between financial years and some additional funding for departments associated with various government initiatives which have been previously announced.

        In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1992-93, appropriations totalling $5.2 million additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1992-93 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the parliamentary departments. The increase sought relates primarily to essential and unavoidable costs associated with activities of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. I commend the Bill to the House.

        This Bill, together with its companion Bills, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1993-94 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94, is a routine machinery measure. It seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period to 30 November 1993, by which date it is expected that the appropriation Bills, which form part of the Budget for 1993-94, will have been enacted.

         Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $13,347.5 million for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $965 million, or about 7.8 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1992-93. This increase reflects a combination of factors, including:
