                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has got nothing to do with offering them decent wages and conditions. This is about the Australian people reaping the benefits from our resources.

We have families living in their cars. We have an ever-increasing welfare debt. We have an ever-increasing debt to the rest of the world that we can't seem to be able to pay. When Prime Minister Albanese became Prime Minister of this country, he said he would see that multinationals paid their fair share of tax. What's happened with it?

If Qatar is exporting less LNG than we are and can make over $26 billion for that country, what the hell is happening here? The problem that I've found over the years in who I've spoken to with regard to this, the resource ministers, is that they didn't have a clue about it, didn't understand what they were talking about, weren't interested. Retention leases are only supposed to be for five years. We keep renewing them, because the lobbyists come in and take them to dinner, and it's: 'Oh no, mate, that's fine. We'll sign off on this. We'll give you another five years.' Some of the retention leases are more than 30 years old. It's got to be 'use it or lose it'.</span>

You can build it if you have the will. But I find that in this place most of the people here have never run a business and they've never employed staff. They've actually come from universities, worked in political offices and then seen their way up to become members of parliament. You have no business acumen. You don't know the effects of it. You actually listen to the bureaucrats, who've got nothing to lose. No-one is held accountable in this place, not even the bureaucrats. They tell you what to do because you lack the competence, the knowledge or the business acumen to know what to do and how to make the decisions in this place that the people out there are relying on us to make for their benefit. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not give up on this. It absolutely disgusts me to think that Labor are not going to be talking to this bill today. They're not going to say a word on it. Why? Why are you shut down? Why aren't you speaking to this? Why aren't you going to explain to the Australian people what is to the benefit of the Australian people? If Senator Ayres is anything to go by, the fact is that successive governments, the benefit of Australia—why have we lost the Commonwealth Bank? Why have we lost the airports? Why have we lost water security? Why have we lost our electricity components? Why have we sold it to multinationals? The Australian people are getting to a stage where they own nothing. They've got no control of their country or their destiny. The politicians in this place, in my opinion, are basically useless, because I don't think you even know what the hell you're doing here. You collect your pay, you just show up and you don't understand the workings of this country, how to benefit the people of Australia. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Benefit to Australia) Bill 2020. I note first and foremost that, while the aim of this bill is a worthy one, it is unfortunately flawed in a way that would result in unintended consequences that may in fact have the opposite effect to its original intention. I agree with the comments made in closing by Senator Hanson, particularly around the way business operates and the importance of our roles in determining legislation in this place. But I do need to talk about the specifics of this legislation amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legal system relies on explicit wording of legislation and clear definitions. By making the term 'for the benefit of the Australian community' open to interpretation by the courts, we would allow radical environmental groups to tie up any projects in legal fights. And it is not out of the realm of possibility that activist groups would use this amended objective to make the argument that an activity such as drilling an offshore well to recover oil or gas would contribute to climate change or have an environmental impact and that therefore it does not benefit the Australian community. This legislation amendment will expose the gas industry and potentially the entire resources sector to green lawfare and drive industry investment away from Australia. This will of course be disastrous for our economy, for Australian workers and for Australian businesses who are benefiting from the investments into these developments, and would severely constrict—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch on Senator Hanson's comments with regard to the PRRT returns and company tax returns. I think what is not well understood is that, when these investments in these projects are made, it is billions of dollars not just in capital investment but also in precursory, environmental and other reviews. That costs a huge amount of money, which is able to be offset on part of the tax calculations, remembering that those dollars are spent in Australia with Australian companies employing Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill talks about community benefit, it is clear that mining in this country does already benefit the community in ways that may not appear on annual profit-and-loss statements. If we want to look at industry figures, the resources sector as a whole supports over 1.1 million direct and indirect jobs within Australia, contributing over $32.6 billion in direct salaries in 2021. The government has even acknowledged that the resources sector is to thank for a $50 billion budget boost this year and a brighter than expected fiscal outlook for Australia. The Australian oil and gas industry directly and indirectly supports over 80,000 jobs. It contributed over $5.35 billion in tax in 2019-20 and recorded a $15.9 billion surplus in the trade of oil and gas. Over the past decade, the oil and gas industry paid more than $64.4 billion to the government, with contributions spanning decades totalling $161 billion since the mid-eighties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This contribution is not limited to taxes. Over the last decade, the oil and gas industry has invested around $473 billion in the Australian economy. This includes about $170 billion spent directly, since 2007, on five offshore LNG projects, including Pluto, Gorgon, Wheatstone, Ichthys, and Prelude, and, as of last year, there are $120 billion worth of projects in the pipeline. That means more jobs in construction, supply chains and new operations. But we do, potentially, risk these investments with the introduction of the government's 43 per cent emissions reduction legislation, the Queensland government's increase in coal royalties and, potentially, this amendment, all of which go to undermining confidence in investment in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Opponents of gas, coal and mining in general are quick to point out that tax and royalty payments are less than they believe they ought to be, but the full value of our resources sector is found away from the balance sheets, the prospectuses and annual reports. It is in the high-paying jobs both in the regions and in the metropolitan company head offices. It's in the sponsorship of sporting teams, events and community groups. Superannuation funds and shareholders rely on a profitable resources sector to supplement their incomes and pay for their retirement. This money flows through local businesses, creating employment, which is also taxed, generating more revenue for the government. Just as mining's ripple effect on the economy is far reaching, so too any impost on the mining resources sector will be felt far away from the pits, the pipelines and the corporate boardrooms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, in Queensland, we are seeing big miners pull out of projects due to the state government imposing the world's highest coal royalties. This reduced investment in regional Australia is disastrous for engineering firms, food suppliers, workwear stores and everyone employed directly and indirectly by the mining and resources sector. Many of these businesses are run by families. They're not driving limousines or flying in private jets; they're cementing a future for their kids, providing apprenticeships and sponsoring local netball and football teams. Rugby clubs such as the Capella Cattledogs and the Emerald Rams in Central Queensland would struggle to survive without sponsorships by local businesses engaged by the resources sector. There is far more community support from resources companies operating in Queensland. We can point to a million dollars to build a new centre for the AEIOU Foundation in Townsville, which specialises in teaching children with autism; $6 million for the Banana Shire Library, museum and community hub; $8 billion for 16 affordable housing units in Isaac shire; $4.5 million for a pool in Mount Morgan; $7.8 million for a pool in Charters Towers; $834,000 for a sports facility upgrade at Cloncurry—the list goes on and on. And this is a snapshot of just one of the hundreds of resources companies operating in Australia that give back to local organisations and enrich small businesses. I can guarantee you that this Labor government would not be directing any additional royalties back to those regional communities.</span>

The Greens supported the same bill last time with amendments that defined 'community benefit' as relating to the effects of climate change, and oil and gas's contribution to temperature rises. In applying this definition to that 'community benefit' term, the Greens proved that the bill's wording can be utilised against the sector to push extreme antidevelopment agendas. I've already touched on the legal system relying on explicit wording of legislation and clear definitions. With this term 'for the benefit of the Australian community' open to interpretation by the courts, we would allow radical environmental groups to tie up any projects in legal fights. </span>

We have already seen in Queensland the Labor government's royalty increase send shockwaves not just through the coal sector but through all mining activities. While Queensland Labor claim they are doing this to benefit the community, the early signs are that it will result in long-term harm for regional communities. Federally, we have seen the introduction of new requirements in the investment objectives of a number of government agencies, like Infrastructure Australia and NAIF, hamstringing investment in industries like the gas industry and sending signals to investors that the government does not support the industry. </span>

We must continue to present ourselves as a viable, responsible and appealing investment opportunity to ensure that we continue to benefit from this sector. Over 70 per cent of our nation's income is drawn from mining and resource activities, not to mention the highly paid salaries and the regional investment that allow towns like Dalby, Chinchilla and Cloncurry to be thriving with the activity of mining in this country. Poorly drafted amendments that can be hijacked and have serious unintended consequences would further undermine future resources investments. There is no benefit to an industry that no longer exists. The coalition will not be supporting this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Benefit to Australia) Bill 2020. This bill is striking in its simplicity. It seeks to ensure that any exploitation of fossil fuels is for the benefit of the Australian community. Our laws do little to guarantee that Australians get a fair share from the sale of our fossil fuel. Worse still, our laws are ineffective in protecting our climate environment against the impacts of their extraction. The flaws in our laws start with offshore leases being granted to companies under excessively generous terms. This amendment could tighten this loophole. But there also needs to be real reform to our tax system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The companies that extract our fossil fuels are overwhelmingly foreign owned. Just look at the gas industry, where 96 per cent of the companies profiting from gas exports are based offshore. The income tax, royalties and petroleum resource rent tax that these companies pay are woefully inadequate. At times, there are misconceptions about the contribution of the fossil fuel industry to Australian prosperity. In fact, the total tax paid by fossil fuel companies represents less than one per cent of government revenue, yet profits are at record levels. In the first half of this year, Woodside Energy and Santos made a profit of more than $4 billion between them, an increase of between 300 per cent and 400 per cent. The profit these two companies made in just six months is equivalent to the cost of sending all Australian children between the ages of three and five to preschool for 10 years, or of electrifying a third of all Australian households. How, I ask members of the government and of the opposition, is that in the best interests of the Australian community? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need now is a windfall profits tax. A convincing case for this change is being made across the community, including by former Labor politicians, like former senator Bob Carr; former senior public servants, like Dr Ken Henry, Secretary of the Department of Treasury under former prime minister John Howard; business leaders, like Mike Cannon-Brookes, the largest shareholder in AGL, Australia's biggest polluter; prominent economists, such as Professor Ross Garnaut; and former chief economist of the World Bank, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who called the measures a 'no-brainer'; unions, including the ACTU; union leaders, like Dan Walton, Secretary of the Australian Workers Union; and public think tanks, like the Grattan Institute. Perhaps the strongest call for this change has come from the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who recently said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fossil fuel industry is feasting on hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any argument that it is too hard or that business will flee is a straw man. Just look at the United Kingdom, where the conservative government has responded to high fossil fuel prices by swiftly enacting a windfall profits tax. That change is expected to raise the equivalent of approximately $13 billion this financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent research suggests that in Australia two out of three people support a windfall profits tax. It is no wonder given the soaring costs of energy bills that households are facing. My colleagues in Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party and I may not agree on many things in this parliament, but, in this case, I admire their foresight on the issue of domestic gas prices. Introduced nearly two years ago, the explanatory memorandum to this bill highlights the problem of our domestic gas market. It highlights the problem of it being exposed to international prices. We are not involved in the war in Russia. We don't import gas from Russia, yet we are paying export prices for our gas. It was long before the invasion of Ukraine that One Nation proposed this amendment. Since this bill was first introduced, the price of gas has increased threefold, as we continue to export 80 per cent of the gas we produce. The effect has been a huge increase in the cost of living for Australians across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A well-designed windfall profits tax would push domestic gas prices down and reduce cost-of-living pressures for Australians. If the measure was applied to the domestic sales of gas and set by a gas reference price from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, it would act to efficiently reduce the cost of gas in Australia. In addition to a reduction in the domestic gas price, the revenue generated by a windfall profits tax could be used to fund development in rural and regional communities. The majority of fossil fuel extraction is from beneath land and sea near to these communities and it is right that the benefits are for them too. I would like to see the additional revenue used to set regional and rural communities up to benefit from a renewable energy future. This could look something like the Nationals' Royalties for Regions program in Western Australia and could be administered by an energy transition authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals rightly point to the need to invest in regional Australia, and Labor has an agenda to transition our economy. A windfall profits tax for the regions can help do just that. I call on the government to start work on the design of policy that will give Australians a fair share of the enormous profits being extracted from our land and seas. I also call on the government to ensure that fossil fuel projects do not go ahead where they are not in the interests of the Australian community. On this point, the IEA, the IPCC and climate scientists all agree it is in the best interests of the Australian community and the global community for there to be no additional fossil fuel projects, especially when projects are opposed by First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people and their country and sea country are disproportionately and unjustly impacted by fossil fuel projects. Many have been fighting against the odds to protect their country from fossil fuel developments. I want to congratulate the landmark win by Mr Dennis Tipakalippa of the Manupi clan of the Tiwi Islands in the Federal Court last week. Tiwi Islanders argued before the Federal Court that Santos did not appropriately consult the Manupi clan about the impacts of the offshore Barossa gas project. In a legal first, witnesses gave powerful evidence on country in the Tiwi Islands about the physical and spiritual impacts that drilling could have on them, their culture and the sacred animals that call this sea country home. The case demonstrates the requirement for deep consultation with traditional owners before approval for drilling in sea country. It is vital that the voices of First Nations people be heard when gas projects such as Santos's Barossa project threaten their country. It is an historic decision, a true David and Goliath battle, and I applaud the Tiwi people for having the courage to take on one of the biggest resource companies in Australia. But this community courage and recent victory come against a backdrop of structural failure. Last week, the UN Human Rights Committee found that the Australian government has failed to adequately protect Torres Strait Islanders and has violated their right to enjoy their culture and lives, by failing to act on the climate crisis. We have to do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support increased emphasis on the need for decisions around oil and gas to benefit the Australian community. This bill is essentially trying to deal with the state capture we see in Australia—both major parties not having the political courage to actually ensure that resources contribute to the wealth of everyday Australians. Over the last few decades we have seen policies that benefit multinational companies that come to Australia, extract our resources and ship their profits overseas. Senator Hanson rightly pointed to Norway and their approach to actually ensuring that their resources contribute to their national wealth. It's a stark, stark contrast to what we see in Australian politics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My sense, when talking to everyday Australians, is that they want politicians to actually ensure that, if we are selling resources from our country, we're reaping the rewards, not multinational corporations, which, as we know, pay little tax and really push the line about jobs and how much they are investing in communities, which is total pocket change when you look at the amount of revenue that they're generating. We know that many of the job figures are also overblown. Another jurisdiction to point out, as Senator Hanson did, is Qatar, which produces less LNG than us but pulls in $26 billion a year in royalties. There's been a clear message from the Australian people that they want more transparency and they want the lives of everyday Australians put at the forefront. I really commend this bill and this amendment to actually ensure that fossil fuel exploration and profits are in the interests and to the benefit of everyday Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the broader point about new fossil fuel projects, it's clear that it's in the best interests of all Australians for them not to go ahead. So we face this point in time where we need to ensure that, with existing fossil fuel projects, we are storing the wealth from them and actually using it to transition our economy, and, when it comes to new fossil fuel projects, we have the political courage to do the right thing, to do the thing that scientists are telling us we have to do and that we know we have to do to actually protect all the people and places we love.</span>

                    </a>  It was this chamber, Senator Scarr—through you, Acting Deputy President—and senators who actually worked hard to get changes to the PRRT. But let me say how disappointing those changes were—25 per cent uplift on exploration rates. At the time of our inquiry, oil and gas companies could uplift their exploration expenditures by 15 per cent per annum and all their offshore operating activities costs by five per cent per annum. The Australian public would even pay for the clean-ups of oil and gas fields, because that was also deductible under the petroleum resource rort tax. The government, thanks to the pressure from this chamber, at least reduced that uplift on exploration expenditure to five per cent. But still we have hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits, and tax that could be paying for schools, hospitals and other important things in this country is not being paid. It is still a rort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Senator Cox very shortly will talk about how the Greens have a very simple solution to this. I know crossbenchers in this place—One Nation, Senator Lambie and previously Senator Patrick—have all tried to bring in proper reform to the petroleum resource rort tax. We need a royalty rate of at least 10 per cent—a base royalty rate that deductions don't work against so that we actually get a return for the Australian people. Yes, some of these companies pay tax and, yes, they employ Australians. But remember: what other industry apart from mining gets its resources and inputs into its production for free? These companies are taking our gas, our oil, our condensate and other products, and they are paying nothing for them. Yes, they are extracting them and they are employing people, but they are paying nothing for them to the Australian people, who own these resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so typical of the LNP to come into this place and say: 'Well, leave it to the free market. They're employing people. Let them get away with these superprofits. Let them get away with paying no tax.' They're still doing transfer pricing. There's still dodgy related-third-party financing going on. There are a whole range of things that these companies are still doing. But I'm proud to be part of a party that, over the last decade, has led to at least some reform in this sector, and we need to see more of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here is where the Greens fundamentally disagree with One Nation: we believe that the form of exploitation—to focus on that word 'exploitation'—of our oil and gas reserves offshore that would best suit the Australian people would be no new oil and gas projects. There are already enough hydrocarbons—enough oil and gas—in reserves that, if we exploit those, we will exceed our Paris target. We will exceed two degrees of warming. Even the conservative International Energy Agency said that, if we are to limit warming to 1½ degrees to protect the future generations on this planet—some of whom are watching this Senate debate today in the chamber—we have to stop exploring and exploiting new fossil fuel projects not just in Australia but internationally. We need to, as quickly as possible, move to a 100 per cent renewable energy footing. Of course we're still going to use petroleum products in the decades to come. There has to be a transition. But we need to move as quickly as possible. The last thing we should be doing is putting in place incentives in legislation, financial or otherwise, that encourage more greedy oil and gas companies exploiting our ocean with the exact same product that, when we burn it, is boiling our oceans, killing our coral reefs and the ecosystems off my state in Tasmania, like our giant kelp forest, and decimating our fisheries and decimating biodiversity in the womb of this planet that is our ocean. It is insanity in this day and age to be doing exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we actually need to do is have legislation in this place that stops all new oil and gas exploration, and the Greens have a bill before this august chamber to do exactly that—to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act to ban all new fossil fuel exploration. But I totally accept the spirit in which One Nation has brought this bill forward today: seeking to get a benefit for the Australian people from the big, greedy oil and gas companies that currently pay very little tax, thanks to an overly generous—extremely generous—and totally out-of-date tax system that relates to the royalties on oil and gas extraction from this country. I remember that we actually called a number of witnesses before the Senate, including the architects of the PRRT, and, as senators, we put the simple question to them. We said: 'Why shouldn't this system be totally reformed? This system was set up for oil production in Bass Strait in the late 1980s and 1990s. Now what we have is vertical integration and massive multibillion—in fact, trillion—dollar projects that extract gas. This was not set up for the gas market or the condensate market.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember speaking to Dr Craig Emerson, who was one of the architects of the PRRT. He said: 'Senator, if you change the system now, it will lead to sovereign risk. We won't see any more investment in new oil and gas projects.' Putting aside the fact that I didn't have a problem with that, I don't accept that changing a tax system purely for the benefit of corporations is in the public interest or that not changing a tax system purely for the benefit of oil and gas corporations is in the public interest. We have a duty to make sure that any mining company pays its fair share of tax in this country. Tax is not a dirty word. We need royalties; we need resource rents.</span>

                    </a>  It is for you, Senator Scarr. It is for you and the Liberal Party, and I totally understand that. But most Australians want to see corporations pay their fair share of tax. They know what it's like when they get a letter from the Australian Taxation Office or they get a call from their accountant and they're told that they didn't fill in their tax return properly or they owe tax to the Australian tax office. Individuals in this country know what that's like. Why should corporations, because they have access to power and influence, get away without paying their fair share of tax?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I am very proud to be part of a political party that has spent so much time and effort in this chamber, over many, many years, trying to get a fairer tax system for all Australians because, if we had a fair tax system for all Australians, we wouldn't actually have a revenue crisis. We would have the money we need to have a social security safety net and to invest in our people, in better health for Australians and in better education—all the kinds of things, Senator Scarr, I'm sure you would agree, would be an investment in the Australian public and in our future. But, more importantly, we would have the money we need to actually pay to avert the biodiversity crisis we have in this country. We would have the money to fully fund our recovery plans for 150 species and habitats—recovery plans which the previous government tried to have removed from the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which were never resourced. We would have money in this country to assist farmers, to assist communities and to restore degraded habitat both in our oceans and on our land. We would actually have the revenue we need to pay for schools and hospitals and all those critical things. That comes down to one thing: do we have the courage as politicians—do we have the spine in this place—to take on big corporations?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator David Pocock talked about state capture in this place. It is a very apt description for the polity I have seen in the decade I have been a senator in this place. State capture is a simple concept. It means big political parties are captured by vested interests through donations and other influences, and they deliver policies those vested interests want. I don't think the Australian public voted for that; I think they voted for change at the last election. A third of all Australians didn't vote for major political parties; they voted for the Greens and other parties. They want to see change. They want to see us break this state capture that, let me tell you, has absolutely paralysed climate action in this parliament, in this building, in the last 15 to 20 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad we are finally moving on with some climate action in this parliament, and I know the Australian people support that. But if we really want to get to 1½ degrees warming—and I want to remind senators: if you believe in the science of climate change and if you look at the changes we are seeing in Australia and around the planet, that is happening at one degree of warming above pre-industrial levels. Record floods, record heatwaves, record fires, loss of habitat—that is happening at one degree of warming. The Paris Agreement wants to limit warming to 1½ degrees. That is a 50 per cent increase on what we've already got. That's not reducing warming in the system by 50 per cent and taking us back to half a degree of warming or reducing warming by 100 per cent and taking us back to 350 parts per million; that is already saying, 'We wave the white flag and accept this planet is going to warm by another 50 per cent on what we've already seen.' That's supposed to be a good thing. Yet the current government's plan is to have us on two degrees of warming. That's a 100 per cent increase on what we've already seen in our lifetimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous government we were on a business-as-usual scenario of three to four degrees of warming, which means that large parts of this planet won't be inhabitable. I don't need to tell senators what the costs of that will be not just to the environment, ecosystems and habitat but to us as a species and to everything we love and stand for. The only thing that's going to fix that is systemic change, and systemic change means political change. It means coming in here with courage and standing up for policies and changes that will at least limit warming on this planet to 1½ degrees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about that, the most important thing we can do is stop all new oil and gas exploration, offshore and onshore, in this country. You can be sure that's what the Greens stand for. That's what we will come into this place and fight for every day, as we have fought through the swamp-and-desert years of the LNP over the last decade in this building.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  This is the second time I've been given an opportunity to speak to this bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Benefit to Australia) Bill 2020; I also spoke to this bill in the last parliament. I acknowledge there are many laudable objectives that sit behind this private senator's bill. There has been a strong tradition in our system of parliamentary democracy of the parliament determining that it is necessary to impose various laws to regulate the conduct of corporations, be they taxation laws, conduct rules, continuing protection rules and so on and so forth. We're now living through a period where we have the greatest concentration of corporate power in the fewest possible hands. I'm talking here most directly about the concentration of power inside the big technology companies. But it has been the same for resources organisations and banking organisations. They have had, over the years, a very strong concentration of power. So, when you look at the best way to manage that, I think it's very important to apply principles. I personally am a subscriber to the Menzian form of liberalism, which dictates that you should have the minimal amount of government regulation in order to promote private investment and private capital coming into the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, here are a couple of the key facts when you look at the resources sector or any major part of the Australian economy. I always start with the fact that we don't have enough money to run this country. We never have had, and that is why we have relied so heavily upon foreign capital for the past 250 years. As far as I can see, there are no pools of domestic capital which are going to come to our rescue and fund these major resources projects. Certainly, the major pools of capital which it may have been possible to use for this purpose can't be used, because the superannuation funds have a sole-purpose test. They are only allowed to invest for the purposes of their members' retirement savings. Whatever you may think about that scheme, that is, I think, a sound principle which should not be pierced at any time in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is, therefore, the foreign investors that will be required to fund these projects. I note that there are great debates about the use of fossil fuels. I think there is no doubt that there will be a need to use gas in the future for many decades. Whether you look at the view of the scientists, the chief scientists and the former Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, or whether you look at the major investors like Larry Fink of BlackRock, everyone is of the view that in the short to medium term there is going to be a need for gas. So the idea that we're not going to have any more gas means that we're not going to have any more electricity or any more lights on in Australia, which is very worrying; it's very concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are where we are; we need to get the gas out of the ground. There will be a need to fund that activity and, as far as I can see, there is no domestic pool of capital which is going to allow that to happen. That's where the foreign capital comes in, and we need to send the right signals to the market that we're not going to engage in undue sovereign risk. Certainly, we have seen this movie before. We saw Mr Connor and his attempts to try to engage in some kind of quasi-nationalisation of resource assets in the 1970s, which led to what was, I think, 15 per cent inflation and a major economic catastrophe which had to be resolved with various measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have seen this movie before. I don't think we want to go back to that particular period, so we need to send the right signals that we as a country want to have that foreign investment. We want to have that foreign investment on the right basis. We will certainly be imposing conditions on corporate activity in Australia, and I think there is a case to be made for some of these organisations to pay more tax. Certainly, my former profession of accounting has done some good things for humanity, I'm sure. But it has also done some rather evil things, and I think that transfer pricing, which has led to the base erosion and profit shifting where, effectively, companies have been able to establish a mining organisation in Singapore, is frankly outrageous. I don't know that there are that many mines in Singapore or many more resources projects in Singapore, but certainly they are managing to pay a very low rate of corporate tax in Singapore on the back of their significant projects that are being undertaken in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'm for lower taxes. I think it's great that Singapore has been able to cut taxes, and I wish that we could have a similar trajectory here in Australia. I note that the UK is now looking to reverse its misguided policy of raising corporate taxes, and we look forward to the UK heading back to a corporate tax rate which I think is going to be 19 per cent. So we should be seeking to compete with Singapore, as well as addressing the major issue of base erosion and profit shifting, which is the mechanism by which the resources companies have been able to fleece Australian taxpayers of taxation revenue. I think there are certainly areas here that have been raised by the crossbench that are worthy of further consideration, certainly in terms of the tax burden that is placed on some of these foreign multinationals. As I say, we need to do it in a way which is not going to spook foreign investors, but certainly we can do it in a way which is at least going to have a better return to the Australian taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say that there are some laudable objectives here, and I think it's good we have an opportunity to raise some issues that are not the issues of the government of the day, and that's what we're here to do as a Senate. I am pleased to make a second contribution on this bill after making a contribution on it in the last parliament. I would summarise my comments here by really reminding the Senate that it is very important that we are cognisant of the fact that we don't have enough domestic capital to fund these major projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For people that believe these projects do need to be financed, that finance needs to come from somewhere. There is no domestic pool of capital that is going to be able to meet this investment need, so therefore we need to send the right signals to the global capital markets that we are a stable democracy that has reasonable corporate laws that are clearly understood and that don't have terms which are not easily understood or are too broad. In the case of this bill I think there is no doubt that the benefit to the Australian community test would be a very, very broad test. It would be hard for a court of law to define what that is. As a legislator, I don't think it is our role to handpass our role to the courts down the road and let them effectively become a quasi-legislature. That is our role. If people want to put a more specific concept on the table, they should do that. That's the first one. We don't want to spook foreign investors; we need to have clear corporate laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to summarise is that in terms of taxation—this is not a tax bill, I should note—I think there is a very strong case for some of these foreign multinationals to pay more tax. I regret very much that my former colleagues in the accounting profession have done so much damage to our taxation revenue collection system by devising these schemes. I do think that it's going to be difficult for us to resolve the base erosion and profit shifting issues without some sort of coordinated effort with other like-minded countries, and I'm sure that we can do that in the years ahead. As I say, I think there are some laudable objectives here, but we need to do a bit more work on it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Benefit to Australia) Bill 2020 on behalf of the Greens. The bill is a very simple one. It inserts a new object into the act which will ensure that the exploitation of these natural resources is for the benefit of the Australian community. One Nation claims that this bill will fix the offshore gas issue, and that the government and the Australian community don't profit enough from these projects. Whilst the Greens agree that the fossil fuel companies don't pay their fair share of tax, we know that the problem goes further than this. We also know that this bill is being worded too broadly to actually give its desired effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that if we truly want to benefit the Australian community, these gas and oil reserves are best left in the ground. There is no other option to do that. We should be leaving it there because we now need to transition to renewable energy sources. This applies to offshore projects, which this bill relates to, but onshore projects as well, as Senator Whish-Wilson has already outlined. We are in a climate crisis, and the science could not be any clearer. No new fossil fuel projects should be approved, opened or expanded. Not one, and definitely not the 114 that are currently in the pipeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really not that hard to understand, but it appears the major parties are still struggling, in particular, when the global markets indicate differently. They are telling us that the customer wants cleaner, greener energy sources. From the perspective of trade, and from mine as the Australian Greens spokesperson for trade, we know that 65 per cent of this gas actually goes offshore. It goes through the trade that we export to other nations around the world. We need to make sure that we actually create that certainty for investors and the public with that environmental and social governance legislation regulation that is required. It is already in the EU, it is already in the US and it is already in the UK, so we need that here. We must do that to make sure that the customer at the other end of the pipeline is happy with that greener, cleaner resource that we trade with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think about the benefits not just in terms of money, but in terms of what that drilling of dirty gas brings to our future generations. What message does that continuation of those fossil fuel projects say to them? We know what that is because of the case of those brave kids who tried to prove that the federal government had a duty of care. The government claimed they didn't have a duty of care to protect future generations from the impacts of climate change. Senator Whish-Wilson has already outlined this, but this is about the assessment of those fossil fuel projects. These kids were initially successful but had their hope ripped away from them when the then environment minister, Sussan Ley, now in the opposition, spent taxpayer money appealing this case. I mean, what benefit does exploitation of gas and oil accelerating the climate crisis bring to them? It's the legacy that we are passing on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though in this place those opposite will argue that scope 3 emissions don't matter, what we know is that these will benefit the rest of the global community—in particular small island nations already feeling the effects of climate change—and we think we've done the least to contribute to that. But in the Torres Strait Islands, in that landmark case last week in the UN Human Rights Commission—which they've won—they argued that actually article 27, the right to culture, and article 17, the right to free and arbitrary interference with privacy, family and home, were proven because we are not caring about the impact of these offshore gas projects on other nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the benefits to our oceans that are becoming more acidic, our unique wildlife, our reefs that are dying and the cultural heritage of our First Nations people? I'm glad Senator Pocock mentioned the Munupi clan of the Tiwi Islands, which I had the privilege to sit with on country and listen to their evidence. We need to think about whose land, sea and sky country this is, and what the impact is on those people. We cannot continue to ignore the voice of First Nations people at every step, right through to rehabilitation. We also cannot ignore First Nations businesses that need to be involved in this. We can't ignore First Nations indigenous knowledge and science, and they must be incorporated in all of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill specifically deals with offshore projects, which are all happening on unceded sea country and that traditional owners have not provided their free, prior and informed consent to. On top of that we need to legislate the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which authorises us to provide that free, prior and informed consent. But for over 200 years our voices have been ignored, our culture is continually being destroyed in this country, and if the government really wants to give First Nations people a voice, this bill does not require a referendum, and it will have an immediate impact on acknowledging our sovereignty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas is the largest polluter in Australia. It's as dirty as coal and it's overwhelming that, like coal, the majority of the gas is extracted in Australia and, as I said, exported. It is not for domestic use. That is a myth. It's one of the biggest myths that is being bandied around in this place and throughout the media to the Australian public. It is the case because huge amounts of energy—dirty energy—are needed to extract and process that gas into liquid so that it can be exported. They're burning that. The Global Methane Pledge says that, so we have to listen to the science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">PRRT is a huge issue. We need to crack down on tax avoidance in Australia, and big companies need to pay their fair share, as Senator Whish-Wilson has already outlined. And I'm glad to hear that Senator Bragg and others in this place have been part of the previous Senate inquiries into PRRT. This is about making sure they pay their fair share of rent in this country. As Senator Whish-Wilson said, there is no other business in Australia or globally that gets its resources for free and sells them on for profit—yet this is what's happening in this country with these gas companies. We have to make sure also that these companies are not a revolving door for ministers. They grant leases and exemptions and funding for these companies to continue the climate-wrecking projects that they once rolled out into their cushy jobs with the same companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the major parties have the stronghold—I'm so glad to see us united on the crossbench—but it's really no surprise that they're against any attempt to ensure that corporates in this country pay their fair share of tax. These companies are eroding democracy—Senator David Pocock talked about state capture and the importance of our democracy—are destroying our planet and are wrecking the cultural heritage of First Nations people around the country. Unfortunately, the governments in this place have been letting them do that. They are letting them continue to do that because they're too scared to stand up to them and do what the public actually wants them to do, enact change and say no to new fossil fuel projects. This is happening from the Barossa to the Beetaloo to Narrabri and to Scarborough in my home state. We need change and we need it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have to do is make sure that in the PRRT changes—the Australian Taxation Office has already named those gas companies, and Chevron is one of them, as systemic nonpayers of tax, despite Australia's gas exporters earning more than $50 billion in exports. The tax office says that they don't expect any significant revenue to be paid under the existing tax system until the mid-2030s. That is unreal. In 2017 Shell admitted that they would never pay PRRT, especially on their 25 per cent share of the Gorgon project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last election was very clear in its message. The Australian public wants meaningful change on climate change action, and we emphasise 'meaningful'. I'd like to take this chance to remind the government, yet again, that we are not seeking just to reduce climate emissions by 43 per cent. We now need to be ambitious and reduce them by 75 per cent. We cannot keep opening new fossil fuel projects. You cannot claim to care for the environment by supporting climate- and environment-wrecking projects like Beetaloo and Barossa, and you cannot claim to care for First Nations people and their voice while you're ignoring their opposition to drilling in their sea country, fracking on their country and removing their sacred rock art. You cannot do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the Greens support this bill in principle, we do not support One Nation's move to prevent members from contributing in the second reading debate. Mine is being cut short. This is the place of debate, and we shouldn't be trying to gag that. I'm proposing the second reading—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide was forced to extend its inquiry by 12 months in April, partly because it had trouble getting important information out of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence. Commissioner Nick Kaldas was asked about it in an ABC interview with Patricia Karvelas last month, and it's worth documenting his response. Patricia referenced the DVA and Defence delays and asked, 'Has information been more forthcoming over the past few months since the inquiry was extended?' Commissioner Kaldas replied: 'Not as yet. We're still waiting for some things to be resolved.' Patricia Karvelas said: 'I consider that—please correct me if I'm wrong—quite alarming. You're a royal commission. Does it concern you that you're a royal commission with royal commission powers and that you've found it so difficult?' The commissioner told it to her straight: 'Yes, it does.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Royal Commission Response) Bill 2022 addresses one of the biggest barriers stopping the royal commission from doing its job: parliamentary privilege. I don't move it lightly. Parliamentary privilege has protected the same witnesses and whistleblowers who fought so hard to get this royal commission established in the first place. It protects people who have come to me and told me the most horrific things going on in Defence. It gave me the power to fight for them. But the Parliamentary Privileges Act isn't working well when it comes to the royal commissions. It gets in the way when those royal commissions need to examine the actions of government. Instead of protecting people with no power, it's shielding people in power from scrutiny. That's why the veteran suicide royal commission hit road blocks. They royal commission wants to ask the hard questions. They want to bring in Defence officials and officials from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and drill down on them. And so they should. That is why we are having a royal commission: to find answers. It's what we set them up to do, but they don't do it. Don't take it from me; take it from the royal commission itself. The interim report says that privilege:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… impedes transparency surrounding government decisions and acts as a shield for the executive from accountability for their commitments and actions taken to implement matters subject to privilege.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's because parliamentary privilege prevents courts and tribunals, including royal commissions, from drawing inferences or conclusions from a report or inquiry that is subject to its protection. That's why the royal commission says it can't inquire into work and outcomes of prior Senate inquiries and Auditor-General reports—of all things!—even though its terms of reference require it to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission can't tender documents subject to privilege and draw conclusions from them. This is ridiculous. It can't ask witnesses who worked on audits of Defence and DVA programs to give evidence about their investigation—not if it wants to use that evidence to make any meaningful findings, anyway. If it wants to use evidence that's subject to privilege in its findings, the only way to do that is to redraw that evidence from witnesses. It has to redo the work that is already done, and it has to rerun the inquiry. That is absolutely pointless. Why would we put people through this again and again? It has to tiptoe around everything we've done in parliament up to this point. All that work that's come before, all the work we did in the Senate—the royal commission can't use it to come to any conclusion about what the government has been up to all these years. It's such a terrible waste. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take what happened with the 2021 Auditor-General report into the successes and failures of culture reform strategies in Defence. The report matters to the royal commission. It made a number of recommendations on how to improve the health, wellbeing and safety of Australian Defence Force members. Defence's response to the audit is relevant to the terms of reference of the royal commission's inquiry. It's publicly available on ANAO's website and has probably been downloaded thousands and thousands of times. But the royal commission, of all things, hasn't been able to use the report in any meaningful way. Counsel assisting the royal commission found that parliamentary privilege prevents them from asking Defence representatives questions about the report, because they can't make any kind of finding or conclusion from evidence that's subject to privilege.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They wanted to show parts of the report on screens at one of the royal commission's public hearings. They wanted to tender it and refer to it in questioning, but parliamentary privilege prevented them from doing so. The risk of being accused of making findings from protected information was too great. They had to make clear that the royal commissioners should not make any conclusions or findings based on the Auditor-General's work—all that work, and it's absolutely useless to them. The counsel assisting the royal commission make it through by looking for official documents that were published outside the parliament and that reference the findings and outcomes of inquiry reports. How ridiculous. What a waste of time, when the reports are sitting there ready to go in their hot little hands. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In one case, they were lucky enough to find an official document outlining the recommendations and government responses to the 2017 Senate inquiry report <span style="font-style:italic;">The constant battle:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uicide by veterans.</span> They use this document instead of the report itself. They had to, to get people into the witness box and to look at what the Australian government did in response to the inquiry's recommendations. It worked then, but it's not sustainable—not by a long shot. We've had 17 reviews in 17 years in the Department of Veterans' Affairs itself. I don't know how many times Defence has been through the audit office on different things associated with their personnel. This is absolutely ridiculous. All this work has been done up here, and they are prevented from using it. It is as simple as that. Instead, they've got to go through it paper by paper to see what's in that. That is not a good way of doing an investigation and it is not sustainable—not by a long shot. We can't have a situation where it comes down to pure luck as to whether the royal commission can get to the evidence it needs to meet its terms of reference.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This royal commission has been hard won by thousands of veterans and their families. They knew it was our only shot to call out the terrible phase of government that led to hundreds of veterans taking their lives. There is nothing higher than a royal commission. We have nowhere else to go. This is the pinnacle for us. Even here, in an inquiry with the strongest investigative powers you can imagine, we see how far executive government will go to avoid transparency and accountability. It just goes to show how hard it is to get to the bottom of the terrible problems at Defence and Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we are moving to enact recommendation 7 of the royal commission's interim report. The provisions of this bill follow the royal commission's recommendation precisely to exempt royal commissions from section 16(3)(c) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act where their terms of reference require examination of government—exactly what the royal commission asked for. I know it's a serious thing to open up an exemption to privilege, but, seriously, there is no other way around this. Trust me, we are pulling our hair out in my office. If royal commissions say they have a problem, then they have a problem, and we need to fix it so they can get on with the job. I thought that's what we're here to do, not to stand here as obstructionists so they can't get their job done. We certainly can't ignore what they are telling us. We have got to find a way to make sure Commissioner Kaldas and the other commissioners can turn over every stone, every rock, and get to the bottom of what is going so terribly wrong in Defence and Veterans' Affairs, and why we have so many suicides in our military. It's not a hard ask.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Tyrrell and I will talk to anyone and everyone about how to fix the problems the royal commission has found. This is why I hope to send this bill to an inquiry. It will be a quick inquiry because it will need the best legal minds out there to be there so we can thrash out the issues the royal commission has raised. We've got to act now and we've got to act fast. Time is not on a veteran's side, I can assure you, when it comes to the royal commission. The sooner the royal commission can get its job done, the sooner we can get it wrapped up and the sooner, hopefully, we will have fewer people out there who have served their country trying to take their lives. That is the whole purpose of having the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission has been too hard won for us to stuff it up now. All those people who rocked up on cold mornings to protest; the mums who came to parliament to tell the PM about their sons they had lost; the brave soldiers and veterans who have stood up and given evidence, even though it hurts and even though it takes them back to a dark place; everyone we have lost; our veterans and our Defence personnel are relying on making this royal commission a success and to find the answers that we need. This has to be our last inquiry into veteran suicides. It has to be. Like I said, after 17 inquiries in 17 years, we can't go through any more. We can't keep reliving our stories and watching the failure of future governments to fix these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on Labor today to take this seriously. Come to the table and help us figure this out. You helped us win this fight, and veterans haven't forgotten that, but now you're in government and you're responsible for making sure this inquiry, hopefully the last inquiry we will ever have, works. You are now in government. Yes, that means hard decisions, and, yes, that means upsetting some of the applecart here. I am asking you to be brave because sometimes we have to be that way in life to get things done. It is up to Labor now to make this happen, but, like I said, it is extremely time sensitive. There is nothing else I have up my sleeve and nothing anybody else can tell me that is higher than a royal commission to slow down these veteran suicides. I am very clear that we can never stop veteran suicides. But, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, if we do this properly we can sure as hell reduce them. We have one chance at this. This is our last one. I'm asking you: give the royal commission everything it needs, because I need somebody else to come up with the answers because I've run out.</span>

This bill before us today raises issues fundamental to our parliamentary democracy. In the first instance, can I recognise the passion shown by Senator Lambie and her commitment to veterans throughout Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment arises from the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide interim report. You will recall that the royal commission was set up by the former coalition government in 2021. Its clear intent was to reduce deaths by suicide within our veterans community. I think, without a doubt, we'd all agree the death of any ADF member or veteran is tragic and is deeply felt by the entire community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2021-22 budget the former coalition government provided $174 million to fund the royal commission and examine the systemic issues surrounding death by suicide of veterans. There is no doubt the royal commission provided very clear acknowledgement of the issues involved. I think it was an extremely important process for the families of our defence veterans and, indeed, part of the healing process for some families. That process, to share their stories and experiences, while extremely distressing, will be of enormous value to all future members of our defence forces. I pay tribute to those who were involved in this way. We know this is a highly sensitive and complex issue, and that there are deep emotional scars that relate to these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim royal commission report was tough reading, but the coalition was prepared for this. Our commitment to serving Australian Defence Force members and veterans was sacrosanct and required no stone left unturned to address defence and veteran suicide. Our support for Australian veterans and their families was in recognition of the service and sacrifice they have made to keep our nation safe and secure.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us deals with the issue of parliamentary privilege, arising from one of the recommendations in the royal commission interim report. As we know, in this place parliamentary privilege refers to special legal rights and immunities which apply to each house of parliament, its committees and members, and is a fundamental part and process of what we do here. We are given a special legal status because it is recognised there are tasks performed here that require additional powers and protections. Special rights and immunities are necessary because of the functions in this place. For example, we need to be able to debate matters of importance freely, to discuss grievances and to conduct investigations effectively without interference.</span>

It was not until 1987, following a thorough review of the whole subject by a joint select committee, that the Commonwealth parliament passed comprehensive legislation in this area.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The privilege of freedom of speech is often described as the most important of all privileges. Its origins date from the British Bill of Rights of 1688. Article 9 of the bill of rights provides:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this was one of the privileges of the House of Commons in 1901 it was inherited by the House and the Senate under the terms of the Commonwealth Constitution.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act preserves the application of the traditional expression of this privilege but spells out in some detail just what may be covered by the term 'proceedings in parliament'. The practical effect of this is that those taking part in proceedings in parliament enjoy absolute privilege. It is well known that members may not be sued if they make defamatory statements when taking part in debates in a house. But the privilege is wider than that and, for instance, protects members from being prosecuted if, in a debate, they make a statement that would otherwise be a criminal offence. The privilege of freedom of speech has been described as a privilege of necessity. It enables members and senators to raise matters they would not otherwise be able to bring forward, at least not without fear of the legal consequences. The privilege is thus a very, very great one, and it is recognised that it carries with it a corresponding obligation that it should always be used responsibly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The privilege of freedom of speech is not limited to members and senators in the parliament. It also applies to others taking part in proceedings in parliament. The most obvious examples of others who may enjoy absolute privilege are witnesses who give evidence to committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentary privilege provides parliamentarians in both houses of parliament with freedom of speech in debates or proceedings in parliament. It does so by preventing courts and tribunals from interfering in these matters. As such, it upholds the separation of powers doctrine within the Australian Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentary privilege extends to royal commissions because they are included in the definition of tribunals. The proposed amendment to the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 would mean royal commissions and other tribunals could have evidence tendered or received or have questions asked or statements, submissions<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>or comments made concerning proceedings in parliament for the purpose of 'drawing, or inviting the drawing of inferences, or conclusions wholly or partly from anything forming part of those proceedings in the parliament'. Royal commissions already have extraordinary powers which go far beyond the powers of a criminal court. The ancient rights of parliamentary privilege must be preserved so proceedings of the parliament can be carried out without hesitation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of parliament, witnesses before committees and the reports of committees are subject to parliamentary privilege to ensure the parliament can access all information required for its deliberation and processes. This protection is important to ensure that those participating in parliamentary processes can engage without hesitation, and it ensures the primacy of the parliament in our democracy. On that basis, the coalition will not be supporting the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ADF members, veterans and their families are right to demand that this crisis be addressed. That is why, when in opposition, Labor joined with families who had lost loved ones to this crisis to call for the establishment of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. The former government resisted taking that step for quite some time, but Labor thought the need for this commission was obvious and absolutely compelling. We strongly supported its establishment, and we continue to support its work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomed the royal commission's interim report, and we released that report on 11 August 2022, immediately after we received it from the commission. We wanted the commission's recommendations to be able to be considered publicly at the earliest opportunity. The government has been closely considering the recommendations made by the royal commission in its interim report. We will, this very afternoon, release its formal response to each and every one of those recommendations to the parliament and to the public and indicate how the government proposes to address those recommendations. The defence and veterans communities, the royal commission, the parliament and the Australian public are entitled to see the government respond to the full swathe of recommendations made by the royal commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this moment, I will not pre-empt that formal response by the government. However, I would like to make some brief observations about the bill that Senator Lambie has brought before the Senate. This bill deals with one particular recommendation in the royal commission's interim report. Recommendation 7 of the interim report recommends:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where their terms of reference require an examination of government, Royal Commissions should be made exempt from section 16(3)(c) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987</span> (Cth).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentary privilege is a fundamental feature of our democratic system and of our parliamentary tradition. Section 16 of the modern Parliamentary Privileges Act descends from article 9 of the UK Bill of Rights 1689, which declares:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This principle is important not because it's very old but because it is essential, even today. None of us in this place could do our work, represent our communities or serve the country as parliamentarians without the proper and appropriate protection that is provided by parliamentary privilege.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Lambie noted in her second reading speech on this bill on 7 September 2022, it is parliamentary privilege that protects whistleblowers who wish to raise matters, including those that are the subject of this royal commission. It is parliamentary privilege that ultimately protects us, as parliamentarians, when we seek to advocate on behalf of the vulnerable, to take on powerful vested interests and to shine a light in some very dark places. Senator Lambie also says that parliamentary privilege should not stand in the way of the proper role of a royal commission. And I agree. I want to note, in respect of that, that the particular protection given to proceedings in parliament, the subject of section 16(3)(c) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act and of this bill, is quite confined, and that provision reads:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Law Reform Commission has considered the effect this provision may have on a royal commission. The Law Reform Commission noted in a 2009 report:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Official Inquiries from investigating allegations of misconduct made in Parliament. In practice, however, a number of inquiries have investigated such claims or conducted investigations touching on the proceedings of Parliament. Although courts have differed on this issue, it appears that Royal Commissions or Official Inquiries will infringe parliamentary privilege if they inquire into the motives, intentions or truthfulness of a speaker in Parliament, or allow witnesses to be cross-examined in relation to words spoken or documents tabled in Parliament. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering this present bill it is important to note, again, as Senator Lambie has already done in her second reading speech, that privilege does not prevent a royal commission from using the proceedings of parliament for other purposes that might be, for example, as background material or to establish matters of fact. Importantly, again, as Senator Lambie noted, it does not prevent a royal commission from obtaining its own evidence on matters put before parliament, for instance, by seeking evidence from witnesses who have previously given evidence to parliamentary inquiries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal commissions are very serious affairs, and this royal commission, in particular, is conducting an inquiry into an issue of the utmost seriousness for our country. We must make sure that both royal commissions and the parliament are able to do their work. As I've said, this government will be formally responding to the recommendations made by the royal commission and its interim report this afternoon. We will work with Senator Lambie, and indeed all senators, in addressing those recommendations and doing what we must to tackle the crisis of suicide in the defence and veterans community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I rise to speak briefly to the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Royal Commission Response) Bill 2022, and I thank Senator Lambie for bringing this bill to the Senate in such a timely fashion. All of us in this chamber, in our work with constituents, particularly veterans, have seen the impact of veteran suicides not only on the Defence Force but on other veterans, on their families and on the broader defence community. It has been genuinely shocking for me to see the lack of care and the systemic failures in dealing with veterans in the short time that I have been the Greens spokesperson for veterans affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said before and I will say again: I don't hold the current government responsible for the mess that the system is in, but I do hold the government responsible for navigating the way through and fixing the system, and for doing it with the degree of urgency that the interim report has shown is needed. One of the key problems, though, that we saw from the interim report has been the way in which the royal commission, under very effective leadership, has not had the ability to look in detail and then draw inferences and conclusions from a series of parliamentary committee reports, Auditor-General reports, government reports and government responses. It is in response to those very real practical concerns that we saw recommendation 7 of the interim report released to the parliament. Recommendation 7 reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Provide exemption from parliamentary privilege Where their terms of reference require an examination of government, Royal Commissions should be made exempt from section 16(3)(c) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 (Cth).</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission made this recommendation because parliamentary privilege in the broader sense had been prohibiting the royal commission from drawing the conclusions or inferences from previous reports created by parliamentary committees tabled in parliament or as part of the broader parliamentary business. The royal commission said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of other reports prepared by the Auditor-General as well as the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are directly relevant to our work. These reports are subject to privilege, meaning we cannot draw inferences or conclusions from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission went on to say how this directly impeded its work, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This leaves us unable to inquire into the work and outcomes of prior critical reports—it hampers our ability to learn from that which came before. This risks an unnecessary duplication of effort. It impedes transparency surrounding government decisions and acts as a shield for the executive from accountability for their commitments and actions taken to implement matters subject to privilege. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stop there to remind the Senate that the royal commission is inquiring into defence and veteran suicide. As has been commented on in this debate and outside, our defence forces have lost more personnel through suicide than in all of the armed conflicts they have been involved in from Iraq to Afghanistan and onward. That is a chilling reminder of the importance of this work. And seeing that the royal commission has been hampered in that work places an obligation on us to see what we can do to remedy that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to amend the Parliamentary Privileges Act, but in a very broad way, by adopting the wording of the recommendations, and I acknowledge Senator Lambie has done that. It does it by removing the limitation in 16(3)(c) of the act that prohibits the drawing of inferences from 'anything forming proceedings in parliament'. That is potentially broader than is needed to deal with the concerns raised in the interim report, which are really limited to reports, responses and those kinds of formal exchanges of documentation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a series of reports, not least the DLA Piper report, which we were discussing earlier, as well as Auditor-General reports and committee reports, which should be in front of this royal commission, not just to note but to have a look at some of the structural failures—and not just structural failures in defence but structural failures in this place—that have seen these reports tabled but no action taken. That has been one of the core limitations, if you read in detail chapter 6 of the interim report. Addressing that is important to veterans, but doing it in a way that respects and promotes parliamentary privilege is the real challenge. There is area to explore in narrowing the scope of this bill—potentially, a short, sharp inquiry to take relevant submissions to get the balance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For balance, I will finish by reading the two sides of the argument. I read again from the interim report, from paragraph 41 onwards:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge the customary importance of parliamentary privilege to ensure that the parliament can debate and investigate matters of public importance effectively and without interference. But for a Royal Commission tasked with investigating systemic issues contributing to suicide—the origins of which may be the action or inaction of government and departments which have been subject to numerous prior reviews—privilege has hindered our work.Our terms of reference require us to consider 'the findings and recommendations of previous relevant reports and inquiries … including any assessment of the adequacy and extent of implementation of those recommendations'. In this Royal Commission, parliamentary privilege extends to a number of reports prepared for, or by, parliamentary committees which consider the same matters or matters directly relevant to our terms of reference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are concerned that parliamentary privilege is not limited to tendering documents or asking questions that might make or imply a conclusion about a decision of parliament. Privilege extends to inviting the drawing of any inferences or conclusions from part of a report or inquiry, even if that inference would not impinge on parliament or any of its members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what is frustrating the royal commission, and you can understand why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we come back to this, the importance of parliamentary privilege, and I say this from the position of a party that does not have majority. I acknowledge, as well, independents. Parliamentary privilege is essential for whistleblowers to know they have protection when they come to us. It's important for us to be able to hold powerful corporations and interests to account. It's important and essential for us to do the work, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span> indicates that. <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Senate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> says this in relation to privilege, and particularly focusing on the Senate:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The law of parliamentary privilege is particularly important so far as the Senate is concerned, because it is the foundation of the Senate's ability to perform its legislative functions with the appropriate degree of independence of the House of Representatives and of the executive government which usually controls that House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parliamentary privilege exists for the purpose of enabling the Senate effectively to carry out its functions. The primary functions of the Senate are to inquire, to debate and to legislate, and any analysis of parliamentary privilege must be related to the way in which it assists and protects those functions. Although the relevant law is the same for both Houses, and is analysed accordingly in this chapter, its particular significance for the Senate must constantly be borne in mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our party is very aware of how essential parliamentary privilege is, and adopts in whole that observation in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span>. We do, however, commend Senator Lambie for bringing on this bill, and we do think that there is a powerful argument to explore it in detail, in a brief committee inquiry, in order to check if we can get that balance right. And we don't have forever to wait. This royal commission's time is running out. Veterans can't wait. If we are going to do this, we should act with some haste.</span>

I am speaking against it, but I want to make some very clear preliminary comments. The first is that I have the utmost and greatest respect for Senator Lambie in relation to her fearless advocacy on behalf of veterans and their families in relation to this subject matter. I've said that in this place before, I've said that outside of this place before and I will say it to people when I cease to be sitting in this place. Senator Lambie, you really should be congratulated, through you, Deputy President, for your fearless advocacy in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to make is, when reading the interim report from the commissioners, one can sense the palpable frustration that they have in relation to how the exercise of parliamentary privilege is, in their view, acting as an obstacle with respect to the discharge of their responsibilities. Indeed, in the letters patent which established the royal commission there is an obligation upon the royal commissioners to act expeditiously, to conduct the inquiry as quickly as they can. The particular document, or one of the documents they were seeking to interrogate in particular, was an Auditor-General report with respect to the culture in the Defence Force. They're frustrated as they feel as if they're being impeded by the operation of parliamentary privilege in that respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, parliamentary privilege is an absolute foundational building block of the institution of the Australian parliament. It is a fundamental building block. And while I heard Senator Shoebridge, in his contribution, talk about a quick inquiry to see if there is a workaround et cetera, this is not something that should be abandoned quickly or changed quickly in the concern that we should try and assist the commissioner's report. This is a really important issue and we need to tread extremely carefully in relation to this matter, and I'm going to expand on that during the course of my remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday in this place I actually dove into the development of parliamentary privilege in our Westminster system, the development of the Bill of Rights in 1689 and what actually led up to the Bill of Rights in 1689 in the United Kingdom, which forms the foundation for the principles of parliamentary privilege. The 17th century in England was a time when there was gross interference with the operation of parliament. Members of parliament were literally put in the Tower of London for expressing views with respect to the arbitrary treatment of citizens, with respect to taxation measures which they considered to be illegal and with respect to criticism of the Crown, the monarch and how the monarch operated. Literally, they were arrested after giving speeches in parliament and put into the Tower of London.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the whole genesis of the Bill of Rights, which, in article 9, which is the foundation stone of our parliamentary privilege here in Australia, contains:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Freedome of Speech and Debates or Proceedings—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">or proceedings—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">in Parlyament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parlyament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental purpose of that article 9 of the Bill of Rights, going back to 1689, is to make sure that—for all of us, here in this place and in the House of Representatives, in the course of our committee work, in the course of documents and in the course of submissions which are prepared for the purposes of parliament—none of those proceedings, none of those processes, are capable of being impeached or questioned in any court or place outside of parliament, and, specifically, in terms of our law, under the Parliamentary Privileges Act, which I'll get to, that includes royal commissions. That has been a longstanding foundation stone in relation to our system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I just want to make a few comments in relation to the operation of the royal commission. I had a look at <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span>, and Senator Shoebridge quoted from <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span> in relation to this matter, and there is very useful information in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers' Australian Senate Practice</span>, the 14th edition, with respect to the development of parliamentary privilege. I want to quote from page 68:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 1983 the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies accepted, in the course of its proceedings, that it did not have the power to inquire into statements made in Parliament. The Royal Commissioner inquiring into the Oil-for-Food Program in 2006 went further in warning counsel to familiarise themselves with section 16 of the 1987 Act—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It then continues, on page 4 of the latest supplement to <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span>, and this is the important point:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Numerous commissions of inquiry have traversed the same ground as parliamentary committees, and have done so without infringing privilege. For instance, in 2017 the Select Committee on Lending to Primary Production Customers recommended that the newly-established Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry consider the evidence published by the committee in the course of its inquiry. While the Royal Commission had access to the information published by the committee—</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">so the royal commission, in this case, has access to that Auditor-General's report, in particular—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">parliamentary privilege limits its use so that, while people could not be directly questioned on their parliamentary evidence—</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, the evidence in the course of producing the Auditor-General's report—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">the commission could use the material—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the boundary, in terms of the limits on the use of what has been prepared for parliament. With respect to the Auditor-General's report in particular, I cite the article 'Can parliamentary privilege be used to shut down parliamentary accountability?' by Anne Twomey, who is probably Australia's leading constitutional law professor, and I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Auditor-General is an officer of Parliament whose performance audit reports are prepared for the purpose of tabling and debate in Parliament and therefore attract parliamentary privilege.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. Today we are about to see another embarrassing backflip by the Albanese Labor government, as it appears they are about to move amendments that will extend the cashless debit card in Australia. The Labor government have misled the Australian public with promises during the election campaign and, embarrassingly, are now having to admit it was a thoughtless grab for votes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments we are about to see allow Cape York, the cashless debit card trial sites and those people in the Northern Territory who have voluntarily transitioned from the BasicsCard onto the cashless debit card to remain on the cashless debit card. This is an admission they messed up this ill-conceived election commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments put forward by the government confirm even they have had to admit that abolishing the cashless debit card is a really stupid idea. They have now provisioned for $50 million to support drug and alcohol support services because they themselves understand the social harm likely to result from the removal of this card from the vulnerable communities and the vulnerable people who so heavily rely on it. Shame on the Labor government for doing what they've done. They left great uncertainty for vulnerable Australians, and, at the eleventh hour, have had to admit to the fact they got it wrong in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, as I said, seeks to repeal the cashless debit card. In effect, it no longer will because of the amendments. This card was put into communities as an important financial management tool, developed with advanced technology to help improve the lives of some of Australia's most vulnerable people. It's an innovative program designed to tackle social harm, particularly harm associated with drug and alcohol addiction, in communities where there are high rates of long-term welfare dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have very serious concerns, and have always held very serious concerns, about any legislation that impacts on repealing the cashless debit card, because we understand the impact it's going to have on the communities it's in and on the people in those communities. There are particular concerns about the way this legislation effectively sends vulnerable people back to a restrictive technology like the BasicsCard—but, clearly, the government have worked that out at the eleventh hour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Really devastatingly, the election commitment to abolish the cashless debit card was made with no consultation. Those opposite will come in here and say the minister has been widely consulting. Consultation occurs before you make the decision, not after you've made the decision. Anybody who thinks what the minister is doing at the moment is consultation needs to get the dictionary out and have a look at what 'consultation' really is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it's important to understand the cashless debit card is one of two methods of delivery of income management in Australia. It's designed to limit spending on harmful things like alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs. Income management has been in place in Australia since 2007. Until the cashless debit card was developed, the only way people were able to undertake an EFTPOS transaction was by using the BasicsCard. The BasicsCard is a standalone technology that can only be used in about 15½ thousand places. These outlets are designated and have to be approved by government. The limited number of outlets that accept the card makes its use highly restrictive for the participants who rely on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recognition of this, the cashless debit card was developed as a new, approved, advanced technology for the delivery of income management, operating using existing banking infrastructure. CDC cardholders are able to use their card at around a million places across the country that have an EFTPOS facility as well as online and internationally. The program is supported with an overall suite of measures implemented to improve community safety, stabilise people's lives and help them to become job ready. This includes a $30 job fund and job-ready initiative and $50 million for drug and alcohol residential rehabilitation facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, the development of the CDC program was a direct response to calls from community leaders. In South Australia, my home state, the South Australian coroner handed down an absolutely devastating and heartbreaking report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Sleeping rough</span>, on the deaths of six people on the far west coast of South Australia. The study found that unsuccessful efforts to curb alcohol abuse were having devastating impacts on individuals, their families and the community. Indigenous community leaders approached the government for support and worked with the government to establish and design a program to assist communities to address the social-harm implications of alcohol and substance addiction and long-term welfare dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The continuation of the CDC program in 2020 was also as a direct response to calls from these community leaders, who told us that the card was working in their community. The continuation of the cashless debit card was passed to enable income management recipients in the Northern Territory to voluntarily transition onto the cashless debit card. Nearly 4½ thousand people in the Northern Territory have made their own decision to move to the cashless debit card. That's why it is so concerning that this legislation seeks to repeal the cashless debit card in the communities who directly rely on its support. Evidence given during the hearings showed that the bill confirmed that the government's intention to extend income management via the BasicsCard and through existing instruments was fundamentally flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are yet to see whether this government is intending to extend those instruments, which expire at midnight on Friday night. That in effect means they will be extending income management in the Northern Territory while at the same time trying to abolish income management in other places around Australia. They need to answer the question of why people in the Northern Territory are being treated differently from people in the other trial sites around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is that we know the cashless debit card is a really advanced piece of technology. As I said, it works in just about every outlet in Australia, online and internationally, as opposed to the BasicsCard. The BasicsCard is also associated with a massive degree of stigmatisation, because the individual needs to be identified by the cashier. The cashless debit card does not identify the individual—unless, of course, that individual seeks to buy a product that has been banned. Despite this, the Albanese Labor government has sought to tick and flick an election commitment with no regard whatsoever for the impact on vulnerable people and vulnerable communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I said, the most disappointing aspect of this bill is that it does not have the support of community elders where the CDC program operates. These communities support the program. They supported the extension of the program back in 2020 and they continue to support the program in their communities. The community inquiry into the bill highlighted that the government has clearly failed to consult with these communities, particularly the Indigenous communities in which it operates. The evidence given by Indigenous Australian Noel Pearson, the founder and director of the strategy for the Cape York Partnership, was very compelling, when he emotively said at the inquiry, 'I think this legislation will wipe out 20 years of my work.' He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in the absence of a solution that had the same functionality as the cashless debit card, our Family Responsibilities Commission and the welfare reform work that we've done via that over the last 20 years will collapse, and that would be a very bad thing. We'd just have to give up. We would come to the point of just giving up on the idea that we can change anything for the future of these communities. You guys will repeal this thing and then you'll walk away. You will repeal the card and then you will walk away and leave us to the violence, leave us to the hunger, leave us to the neglected children. It's very easy to forget about remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, at least we have seen that this government have listened to Mr Pearson, because they have extended the cashless debit card for the Cape York community. What we have seen today and what we will see when the amendments come into this place is that the government is, in effect, going to keep the cashless debit card. They probably will change its name, because they want to con the Australian public into believing that somehow they have done what they said at the election. They haven't. they are lying to the Australian public. They have no intention of getting rid of the technology—it is the cashless debit card—because they have already agreed with Mr Pearson and the Family Responsibilities Commission that they will continue to use the cashless debit card until some new technology that they are designing comes into effect, which I bet will be the cashless debit card by another name.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen numerous comments from other people where the card works. As an example, Mayor Perry Will from the District Council of Ceduna noted, 'We have had no consultation about it at all. The first we heard of it was the Prime Minister's election promise that he was going to do it. Prior to that we had had no representation from any Labor politicians.' Likewise, the mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, John Bowler, said that he was disappointed the decision to scrap the card was made before the Assistant Minister For Social Services, Justine Elliot, had visited the Goldfields in August 2022. He told the hearing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It almost seems they are putting the cart before the horse. I would have liked for them to come here, consult with us, consult with the community, and then make a decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has become clear that Labor is intent on taking a backward step on income management in Australia just to play politics. However, they were called out for what they were doing and they have now had to make an embarrassing backflip.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to those senators opposite: be honest with the Australian public. Be honest with this chamber about what you're intending to do, because the cashless debit card was designed with absolutely only the best intentions and the best outcomes at heart for those communities that sought for the cashless debit card to be part of the tools that were available in their community to help vulnerable people, particularly those who were dealing with serious addictions to drugs and alcohol, to make sure they could stabilise their life, so they could put food on the table for their children, so their children went to school and so they were supported on their journey away from addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's absolutely reckless decision to scrap the cashless debit card has created immense uncertainty in these communities. Right now we only have a 'trust us; we will fix it later' approach from this government. Apparently they're going to change the income management legislation to enable an advanced technology to deliver income management. That suggests to me that they're going to use the cashless debit card under the income management legislation, which in a sense just goes to show that this government is not genuine. They are not honest. They are happy to mislead for an election commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear in the evidence that the government supports the continuation of compulsory income management. We know that it is very likely that this week they will extend the instruments to make sure that compulsory income management is continued in the Northern Territory. We know that they are likely to move amendments in this place this afternoon or tomorrow to extend the use of the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would hope that they wouldn't waste the massive investment that has already gone into the cashless debit card platform, a platform that allows the universal network of the Australian banking infrastructure to be able to deliver a seamless product for those people who we are trying to get support to stabilise their lives. We know that the CDC is an effective mechanism. The government must stop playing politics. Stop pretending that you are doing something that you're not and actually be honest with the Australian public about the importance of supporting vulnerable Australians on their journey to recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition condemns the government for this bill. We condemn the government for the way they have gone about putting this bill into this place. We condemn the government because of their lack of consultation—in fact, there was no consultation before they made a decision to rip a very valuable support mechanism out of vulnerable communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hope that the government is transparent and comes clean with its intentions going forward. I would hope that they provide more information as they make their contributions on this bill about what their intentions are for compulsory income management going forward, for voluntary income management going forward. I would hope that they are honest about the technology platform that they intend to deliver income management on going forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment, in effect, seeks for the third reading of this bill not to proceed until such time as the government lays on the table, clearly and distinctly, what its intentions are for income management going forward, and that that legislation has the opportunity to have the appropriate scrutiny of this place and the other place before we move to this reckless interim step that is going to damage lives, create greater uncertainty and deliver absolutely nothing to support the lives of the most vulnerable in our community, which is what the cashless debit card has sought to do for the last six years he opposition will not be supporting this bill. </span>

Anyone living in Ceduna in South Australia, in the Goldfields or East Kimberley regions in WA or in the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay region in Queensland who has been on the cashless debit card will finally be able to control their own finances again. They will be able to buy clothes for their kids at second-hand stores, able to pay cash for fruit and veg at street markets and able to buy stuff on eBay, rather than having most of their income quarantined on a debit card.

Abolishing this card is an important step towards social equity and racial justice. We thank all the groups who campaigned and fought against this punitive and horrific measure and called for it to end, and we thank the many people who were vulnerable and brave enough to share their stories of what it meant to be on this card and the damaging impact this card has had on them. They did it in evidence to the inquiry and in their advocacy both before and after the election.</span>

But we must not forget the many people who will continue to be subject to compulsory income management, such as the BasicsCard, once the cashless debit card ends. We must remember the people in the Northern Territory who are on the cashless debit card, who are going to be forced back onto the BasicsCard, albeit an enhanced version of it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Senate inquiry into the cashless debit card, the committee heard of the disproportionate impact of the card on First Nations individuals and communities and its contribution to the ongoing injustices of colonisation and persistent economic inequality experienced by First Nations peoples. This stark division in how we treat First Nations peoples compared to non-Indigenous peoples in Australia will be even more acute if compulsory income management in the Northern Territory continues after the repeal of the cashless debit card. This is why the Greens are calling to an end to all forms of compulsory income management in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final four months of the Howard government, Australia was one of only four countries that voted against the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As the United Nations described it, the declaration establishes a universal framework of minimum standards and elaborates on existing human rights standards and fundamental freedoms. Article 19 of the declaration specifies: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although we are glad the Australian government subsequently reversed its position and supported the declaration, there are multiple examples of legislation that has passed through this place that consistently fails to meet the standards outlined in this declaration. Of particular relevance to the bill for us today, Australia's history of colonisation and racism extends into how income management has been designed and deployed in ways that disempower First Nations peoples and that run directly counter to the principles of free, prior and informed consent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compulsory income management undermines self-determination for our people. It is a mechanism by which Aboriginal people and communities are further disempowered, particularly given the ongoing impacts of the Northern Territory Intervention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr John Paterson, CEO of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliances Northern Territory, shared with our committee the harm associated with the punitive approaches inflicted as part of the intervention and the racist accusations used to justify them. In a really heartfelt contribution to the inquiry, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is what happened as a result of the intervention in the Northern Territory all those years ago. . . It causes trauma and stress on us. When you're trying to lead organisations and you're leading your mob, and you've got people out there just casting all these aspersions on you, and labelling you, and you have politicians making all these crazy comments that they can't support with evidence, and you've got to try and live and work with that—I struggle with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, this is something we have to talk about with regard to compulsory income management. It is a racist policy that has been imposed by government primarily and predominately on First Nations peoples, and it must end. We know from the evidence that compulsory income management doesn't work. To all those who are arguing for the continuation of compulsory income management as a measure to address social problems, I implore you: listen to the evidence; it doesn't work. We've heard it from the Australian National Audit Office, who said in the second report on the CDC that the Department of Social Security had 'not demonstrated that the CDC program is meeting its intended objectives'. Similarly, the Australian Council of Social Service told our inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no credible or conclusive evidence that these policies have delivered better outcomes for individuals or their communities. Instead, cashless debit and income management are paternalistic policies that restrict basic human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The St Vincent de Paul Society told us:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the card should be scrapped because it is discriminatory, punitive, costly and ineffective. It has not produced significant, long-term reductions in the use of habitual alcohol, gambling or illicit drugs or improvements in participants' budgeting strategies or socially responsible behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, rather than simply failing to develop the benefits that some of the paternalistic advocates claim, it can actually cause harm. Dr Elise Klein summarised in her evidence:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… research published by the ARC Centre of Excellence; the Life Course Centre, examined compulsory income management in the Northern Territory, and showed a correlation with negative impacts on children, including a reduction in birth weight and school attendance. The research implications are significant and draws attention to several possible explanations for the reduction of birth weight, including how income management increased stress on mothers, disrupted existing financial arrangements within the household, and created confusion as to how to access funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Greens will support the passage of this bill. However, we strongly oppose the provisions in the legislation that will enable the minister to move people from the cashless debit card onto other forms of compulsory income management like the BasicsCard or the new, enhanced BasicsCard. I want to be very clear that we will be moving an amendment to reflect that and to reflect our fundamental commitment that compulsory income management should not be imposed on anyone. Rather than being a genuine abolition of compulsory income management, the legislation as currently written will simply shift thousands of people, largely First Nations peoples, from one form of compulsory income management onto another with the same failings and the same punitive impacts. The Greens support an opt-in voluntary option for income management for those who want it. We welcome the announcement from the government that they will be moving towards ending all compulsory income management at some stage. But we think it can and should happen sooner. Compulsory income management is a failed punitive policy that can and should be removed as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond removing compulsory income management, we need to be funding the services and the supports for communities that are needed across Australia. It's simply not enough to remove the harsh punitive conditions that have been in place; we actively need to provide the support and the services that are needed in communities across the country. We've had a decade of Liberal government cutting key programs across Australia, and now a Labor government is arguing that because of the decisions a Liberal government made they can't fund the services that we need. People who are struggling in communities across the country deserve better. That's why at the last election we Greens took a platform of providing a billion dollars extra a year in funding for essential social services so that services like drug and alcohol services, family and domestic violence services, and the community services that are so urgently needed can be funded. That's what needs to be put in place. As we get rid of compulsory income management as soon as possible, we need to be putting in place the funding for those support services that will genuinely allow people to be living their best lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I foreshadow that we will have a second reading amendment to address this issue and we will call for cross-party support for the basic principle that, regardless of your position on the cashless debit card, we must ensure that services are provided for people in the community. As well as repealing and abolishing all forms of compulsory income management, there is much more that must be done. We need to be funding services and, critically, we need to be ensuring that anybody in Australia has the income they need to survive. Anybody in Australia should be able to get a guaranteed liveable income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that guaranteed liveable income, there are two key things. One is to end the punitive conditionality that permeates so much of our income support system, which the cashless debit card and compulsory income management absolutely exemplify—the mutual obligations, the income management, and the other programs that make it hard for people to access income support. The second thing we need to be doing is raising the rate of all of our income support payments to ensure that all payment rates are above the poverty line. So let's be clear: we are abolishing the cashless debit card in the four trial sites today but more needs to be done because poverty is a political choice, and we cannot end poverty in Australia if we punish those who are suffering without enough to live on. It is cruel, it is often racist and it must stop.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  Let me tell you, the cashless debit card was flawed from the very beginning, and our government was formed on the platform of no-one being left behind and no-one being held back. The evidence presented to us showed that many CDC participants forced to use the card felt marginalised, embarrassed, and reported a loss of freedom and choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let me remind this Senate of a bit of history. It's interesting to hear the other side give a completely forgetful version of history, in my view. In 2016 when I entered the Senate, I spoke about what happened in the NT in July 2007 when the Northern Territory parliament, the Northern Territory people, were intervened on in such an incredibly dramatic way without any input, without any view. It was certainly, when I was the member for Arnhem in 2007 standing in the parliament of the Northern Territory, the most disempowering moment not just for me as the member for Arnhem but for all of those constituents I was there to represent. I could say nothing. I could do nothing. The humiliation of people, the shame that people felt all carried through with the Northern Territory Intervention, which saw the arrival of the BasicsCard. Now I pick up on the reflection of history on the other side, a forgotten reflection of history, in my view, where Senator Ruston says that we on this side don't care about the people of the Northern Territory on the BasicsCard. Well, I ask you: in your time as the previous minister in this role, how many inquiries did you hold into the BasicsCard to actually ask the families of the Northern Territory how they were going?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a very long road for the people of the Northern Territory and, indeed, for all of those now who are on the CDC right across Australia. I have objected to this from the day I entered this Senate and I am incredibly proud that our government has brought this as an urgent piece of legislation for this Senate to push through. There are thousands of Australians out there who do not want to be on this card, and it is up to this Senate to make, I believe, the right decision to ensure that this legislation gets through. None of the previous inquiries or reports over four years could say that the CDC was working in such an effective way that it was reducing trauma, that it was reducing domestic violence or that it was increasing people's ability to live a life free of all of that. None of those reports could say that. Let me remind you, senators, that one of the reasons the CDC was introduced was because it was meant to do those things. It was meant to see a better quality of life for Australians. That was the initial intention, but somewhere along the way that got lost, that got forgotten. It took those reports that came to our Senate inquiries—and these were not Senate reports; these were academic reports that were done on each of these communities under the CDC. So when senators opposite get up and say there's been no consultation, let me tell you: this has gone on for a very long time, and that is the very reason why the First Nations caucus committee of the federal Labor Party pushed for this policy to be integral in taking it to the recent federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt, Senators, that we from this side of the house are very clear in our objectives here. There has been no mistake. In this term of parliament, in this very short term, through a Senate inquiry that many senators here took part in to look into this bill, we most certainly did listen. And I commend Minister Rishworth and Assistant Minister Elliot for the travels they embarked upon, not long after being appointed in their ministerial positions, to go to each of these CDC sites across the country. They did so straightaway. Why? Because we knew it was important. We knew it was imperative. We knew that there were Australians out there who were suffering, who needed some security about what their future was with this card. That's why Minister Rishworth and Minister Elliot took off across the country, listening, talking and bringing forward this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, yes, Senator Ruston, there are amendments to deal with but, hey, that's what Senate inquiries do. Senate inquiries into pieces of legislation do that. Hello? It's what we do with many pieces of legislation because we believe and trust in the democratic process of that inquiry. And that's why these amendments have come into this particular legislation at this particular time—because we waited for the Senate inquiry to see what people were saying. Now, you may jest that we've made an amendment in relation to Cape York. But guess what? We listened to people like Noel Pearson, to organisations like the Family Responsibilities Commission. We listened to them because we knew that it was critical, and that it was different in terms of the way the Family Responsibilities Commission handles the program up in Cape York.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that previously, in opposition, through the many Senate inquiries. In fact, I recall sitting in Darwin at a Senate inquiry and listening to the Family Responsibilities Commission and others—elders from that community—giving evidence. And I recall thinking: 'You know what? This is a ground-up way of looking at these problems. The elders are involved. They are participating. They're the ones working with their family members, kinship groups, and saying, "Okay, this is the decision we'll make in a consultative way."' And I had thought then that if that particular program had come in in 2014, as opposed to the style of CDC that came in, we might have been in a pretty different sort of place. So I do commend the people of Cape York with what they are trying to do, and we are unashamedly bringing in this amendment because of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You ask about the people of the Northern Territory with the BasicsCard. Well, I come back to the start of my speech. I recall the Intervention into the Northern Territory in 2007 and what it meant for my constituents, the heavy-handed approach that was used. And, yes, the BasicsCard continued, even under a Labor government—again, to the disquiet and discontent of so many of my constituents—but I never forgot. But I never forgot. I never forgot. I have brought that here into the Senate because I want the Senate to never forget that deep feeling of disempowerment, disrespect and shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We may not be dealing with the BasicsCard right now—you can call it whatever you want on the other side—but we are about process on this side. We realise something: you members opposite championed the CDC, yet you had no plans beyond 31 December. For all of those 17,000 people or more on that program, you had no plans beyond 31 December. You just threw it all down, packed your bags, walked off and said: 'It's their problem now. They're the new government; they can handle it.' Guess what? We are handling it, and we are pointing out your inability to have made steps for those thousands of Australians who required greater dignity and greater knowledge of what this parliament was going to do about their future in assisting them in some of the most basic things—financial support, quality of life, being able to pay their bills, being able to pay their rent. The stories of people homeless, not knowing what their future was and still not knowing—that's why we've got to get this bill through. Yes, we will come back to the BasicsCard. I can tell you now, senators, that is one area I will not let this Senate let go of. We need to discuss that with the families of the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the questions I kept asking of the former minister, Senator Ruston, was: How much money was spent doing all those ads across the Northern Territory to get people off the BasicsCard and onto the CDC? How much money did you spend? I could never get an answer to that question, but let me tell you—I'm certainly checking the books now on this side. You spent so much money to try and get at least 4,000 people onto the cashless debit card, but you still didn't worry about the 22,000 people on the BasicsCard. You still had no inquiries, you had no investigations, you had no consultations, and you come in here having a go at us about the BasicsCard? No, no, no, senators. No, no, no, you won't. I will keep reminding you of what you didn't do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, we have a lot of work on this side, now that we have that responsibility. I am proud to bring this legislation before the Senate, and I have no objections whatsoever to what we are asking of senators here. But I do make this plea to those senators on the crossbenches, and I do remind those senators who came to the Northern Territory in particular—Senator Lambie, from your visit to Central Australia and to far north-east Arnhem Land: remember the Yolngu. Remember the families that spoke to you. They still hold those same messages today about what they want for their future. You know what they said to you. I took the former senator for South Australia Rex Patrick to the Northern Territory, and even he saw the importance of this debate to First Nations people—that, for once, they could be heard instead of being trampled over as we were in 2007, when there was no debate and no discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reassure the Senate that I will make sure that there is comprehensive, dignified discussion with families about the BasicsCard. I thank the Arnhem Land Progress Association and the work that it has done and continues to do with residents and employees across its many locations. You are the ones that started with your ALPA card, and that was prior to the intervention in 2007. The ALPA card came out months before that did. Imagine if you had been consulted about this kind of income management or money counselling. Imagine if you had been counselled and consulted. Imagine where we could see that ALPA card today, had there been that discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a long memory, senators. I will always put on the table where we could've done better on this side, and I will always point out in the Senate where you should've done better on your side.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I too rise to make a contribution to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. Without a doubt, ending the cashless debit card will go down in history as the greatest piece of ideological madness that this government will perpetrate in this parliament. In fact, what we've just heard today is that at the last minute they will be rushing amendments through this place in relation to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One needs to ask why the government would do that, particularly when this was one of their election commitments. It was one of their election commitments, yet they are about to rush some amendments through this place. Perhaps the sheer weight of the evidence they were confronted with was so overwhelming that they finally realised this was an act of nothing more and nothing less than ideological madness. The previous speaker, Senator McCarthy, stated that the government was very clear in its objectives here—so clear that at the last minute we haven't even seen the amendments. We hear the minister saying: 'We got it wrong. It's not great that we got it wrong, seeing as we're out there telling everybody we got it right. We got it wrong, and we are going to have to make some changes.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps, though, it's because they listened to the coalition. They listened to the weight of evidence that was presented to them. Perhaps now they better understand that this ideological madness that they were about to undertake would actually have made the lives of so many Australians much worse than their lives are today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the bill in its current form goes through, this is what the Albanese Labor government are going to be delivering to thousands and thousands of Australians. They will continue to see the scourge of alcoholism. They will continue to see the scourge of drug addiction, gambling and domestic violence in their communities, where—and this is what the weight of evidence shows—the cashless debit card has successfully contained these problems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What kind of a government would want to inflict this sort of pain upon fellow Australians? The answer is clear: it is a heartless one, and it is a government that cannot see past its ideological bent on this issue. Given the weight of evidence, given that communities are crying out for this card, those opposite should hang their heads in shame on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the purpose of the cashless debit card. It's a very simple purpose. It's to prevent income support recipients from spending a significant portion of their payments on potentially harmful goods, such as alcohol, illegal drugs and gambling. I am still at a loss to understand how the Albanese Labor government thinks, based on the sheer weight of overwhelming evidence, that this is a bad thing. The cashless debit card was introduced by the former government as a means to ensure that those receiving welfare payments were spending taxpayers money on basic necessities such as food, household bills and clothes, and not on habits that enable a destructive lifestyle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at and listen to the stories, when you understand the impact that this card has had on families, you see that it has allowed countless families on welfare across Australia to feed, clothe and provide for their children—I don't know why that is a bad thing—rather than to see their money be wasted on drugs, alcohol and gambling. In fact, listening to the weight of evidence, in many instances it has reduced domestic violence and it has reduced alcohol consumption, and when you reduce domestic violence and alcohol consumption you see the number of people presenting to the emergency department at a hospital also decreasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some figures. As at last year, around $2.5 million worth of transactions on restricted products had been declined in the Goldfields. What does that mean? It means that $2.5 million was, therefore, better spent on food, paying bills, clothes and other essentials rather than on the alternative, which Labor and the Greens would like to allow, of pubs, bottle shops and the TAB. Look beyond the card's stated purpose and at examples of people in the communities who had the cashless debit card. What did they say? I remind the Senate that these are not people in Canberra. These are people who are on the cashless debit card who are living in communities, who have real life experience. They are real people who have realised the benefit of what the cashless debit card has offered them. For example, in Ceduna a community paramedic said, 'Since the cashless debit card, we've definitely seen a decline in domestic violence, alcohol consumption and the number of people presenting to ED at the hospital.' I am at a total loss to understand how that is a bad thing and why the Albanese Labor government wants to get rid of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about community leaders in Laverton in my home state of Western Australia? They have pleaded with the government not to get rid of this card. What have they said? They have been forced to plead for an emergency contingent of police officers and paramedics because, as a result of the legislation that we have before us, they are anticipating a surge in violence when thousands of local residents are taken off the card. That is what this government is going to be responsible for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, Indigenous and non-Indigenous leaders in Laverton told the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper: 'The card has ensured children have been fed and clothed.' That's it. The card has ensured children—young children, who have no control over where this money is going unless they have the cashless debit card—have been fed and clothed. That, quite frankly, is something that all of us in this place take for granted every single day. They fear what is going to happen when this legislation goes through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Laverton shire president, Patrick Hill, said the community 'had been brought to its knees by alcohol abuse in the years before the locals opted to support a trial of the cashless debit card'. He said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We had the RFDS here constantly to pick up DV victims, kids were not being looked after and not going to school, (and) you know it's bad when the ambulance needs a police escort to go to incidents … We wanted to explain all that to the Government before they took the card away—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">listen to this, Mr Acting Deputy President McGrath—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">because it's the only thing in 30 years that has made any difference.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, guess what? Today, because of the ideological hatred that those on the other side have for actually giving people a helping hand to survive, we say goodbye to the only thing that in 30 years has made any difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Janice Scott, a Wangkatha elder, established a residents group in Laverton in 2016 out of concern for the welfare of local children. Let's have a look at what she said: 'The biggest difference was for the kids. Suddenly they had food. They had clothing. People used to throw rocks on my roof in the middle of the night, saying "I'm hungry," and that stopped. They had food at home.' Shame on those opposite for demeaning Janice with this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigenous man Marty Sealander is chief executive of Laverton's Pakaanu Aboriginal Corporation. He said his organisation wanted the card and that it had 'put things on an even keel in town'. He said: 'What you don't see anymore is the gambling, where people are sitting around playing cards with cash. That's finished. Families don't use the food program at the schools as much. They're buying groceries. And people with serious drinking problems are getting really drunk once a fortnight, not three or four times a fortnight like they used to.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, there is the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, which also backed the retention of the card. Again, they highlighted the benefits that they have seen because of this card. They said: 'The program has demonstrated significant value in the community not only by linking participants to employment but also by providing opportunities for them to engage in training and skills development.' The city's submission to the relevant inquiry said there'd been a 57 per cent decrease in crime—wow! a 57 per cent decrease in crime—from 2018 to 2022, following the rollout of the card. The most significant crime decreases observed were in non-dwelling burglary, property damage, drug offences, dwelling burglary and the stealing of motor vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what they said: 'With the abolishment of the cashless debit card, there is no doubt that the region will need to rely more heavily on the state government to provide additional law-and-order services to ensure that the level of crime does not reach the unprecedented levels experienced three years prior to the introduction of the card.' Again, I am at an absolute loss to know why the Albanese Labor government thinks that abolishing the cashless debit card, even with its amendments, is a good thing, given the sheer and overwhelming weight of evidence that clearly supports the benefits that this card has had to some of the most vulnerable in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, there is my colleague Senator Nampijinpa Price. She is, as we know, an empowered Warlpiri Celtic Australian woman from the Northern Territory. In her maiden speech to the parliament she said, in relation to the cashless debit card, that it has:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… allowed countless families on welfare to feed their children rather than seeing the money claimed by kinship demand from alcoholics, substance abusers and gamblers in their own family group. I could not offer two more appalling examples of legislation pushed by left-wing elites and guaranteed to worsen the lives of Indigenous people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are debating here today is a piece of legislation that an Indigenous woman from the Northern Territory who has lived and breathed these experiences says will, when it goes through, actually worsen the lives of Indigenous people in this country; she is very open in saying that. What did she then say? She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet at the same time we spend days and weeks each year recognising Aboriginal Australia in many ways—in symbolic gestures that fail to push the needle one micro-millimetre toward improving the lives of the most marginalised in any genuine way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, guess what? I know whose view I back in relation to this: Senator Nampijinpa Price's. She is someone who will stand up for the rights of Indigenous people in this country—somebody who will only ever ask what practical difference this policy is going to make to the lives of Indigenous people in this country he speaks from experience. She doesn't come in here as a left-wing elitist. She speaks from experience. She has seen the benefits firsthand, up close, in her own community. That's who the government should be listening to: people like Senator Nampijinpa Price. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should hang their heads in shame over this issue. It is ideological madness, nothing more and nothing less, despite Senator McCarthy saying it clearly is not. Quite frankly, the best thing you could do today is pull your legislation, go back out, listen to the community and then end this ideological madness.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  It's a pleasure to follow Senator Cash and her comments on this bill, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. I'm glad we're having this conversation about the future of government welfare. It takes many forms and there are many Australian people who receive it. There's doubt many Australians truly need it. There's also no doubt that many Australians who receive it do not truly need it. There are many more Australians who pay for it. It's costing taxpayers almost $200 billion—that's billion, not million—a year. There are almost as many opinions about whether it is too much or too little and whether it really does any good. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there is one opinion which strongly prevails among the Australians who fund this welfare: those who receive it should be accountable for it. This is reflected in some of the conditions and obligations placed on recipients, such as education, training and job seeking. Australians who fund welfare with their taxes understandably have an expectation that money not be squandered by those receiving it. They don't like it when recipients spend all their time on the couch instead of actively looking for work, or at least being in training for work. They don't like it when they see recipients spending welfare money on things like alcohol, drugs and pokies. Most recipients don't do this, but it begs the question: why do we have over 900,000 people on unemployment benefits yet jobs aplenty are waiting to be filled? Are these people incompetent, illiterate or just plain lazy, believing everyone else owes them a living, not just a helping hand in a time of need?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When there are others depending on them, like children, there can be big problems. This is especially the case in communities with higher levels of long-term welfare dependency. I won't beat around the bush: many of these communities are predominantly Aboriginal. It was these problems—children going hungry and without education, alcohol and drug related violence, family and domestic violence, poor health outcomes, widespread crime and social unrest—that the cashless debit card aimed at addressing. It did this by limiting the spending of up to 80 per cent of a person's welfare income to essential items like food, clothes and rent. The basic idea was to ensure that people on welfare experiencing difficulties with prioritising the essentials themselves no longer had to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trials were limited to a few areas, some of them with high levels of long-term dependency and a history of related social problems, particularly alcohol fuelled violence and neglect: the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region in Queensland, Doomadgee in remote north-west Queensland, Cape York in Queensland, parts of the Northern Territory, the Goldfields region around Kalgoorlie and Esperance in Western Australia, the East Kimberley region in Western Australia and the Ceduna area in South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the cashless debit card was not without controversy or teething problems, some of which persist. It has not been entirely successful in completely quarantining welfare income for spending only on essentials. People have found ways around the restrictions—for example, buying someone else's groceries with the card in exchange for cash, which is then spent on things that cannot be bought with the card. There has also been frustration at its limited utility, especially in online transactions, and also because some shops in the trial communities did not or could not accept the card. However, these problems have been outweighed by some very good outcomes. Violence related to alcohol and drug use has declined significantly in some of these trial regions. More kids are going to school, and more of them are being better fed. Quite a few people on the card have reported that it helps them manage their household expenses much better than before.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to the Goldfields region in Western Australia and saw this for myself. I spoke to Indigenous elders, local government leaders, local public servants and others in these communities. I spoke to many who were literally pleading for the cashless debit card to be rolled out much more widely. I heard how, before the card, older family members would force younger ones to hand over all their welfare money. It's a cultural thing for Aborigines to hand over money to other family members. Some who refuse face the risk of being bashed. One employer told me that a young Aboriginal man who worked for him quit his full-time job because his family forced him to hand over his pay. Working provided no future for him. The card prevented a lot of this sort of thing from happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation supports the cashless debit card and income management being imposed on people and communities that clearly need it. I'm convinced that it does little harm and does much good, and I want to see the concept extended. To those who say that it unfairly targets Indigenous communities, I say: you're wrong, and you need to get out into those communities like I have. You need to be honest with yourselves and the Australian people and admit that problems like domestic violence, sexual abuse, drug and alcohol dependency, and unemployment are highly prevalent in Indigenous communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But wait—there's more, isn't there? 'The Voice will end all that, won't it?' We're going to have the Voice and it's going to fix all these problems! You need to witness and experience the unrest, the violence and the poverty for yourself and understand how income management makes a positive difference. Those supporting this legislation must explain to these communities and the Australian people what you're going to do about the fallout. What are you going to do about the return of the alcohol related violence, the increasing social unrest and the children who will again go hungry when the card is gone? How are you going to ensure that Indigenous children have the same education as non-Indigenous children? You can't—and won't, until you enforce the same laws that require every child to attend school, regardless of race.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aboriginal parents can be reluctant to send their children to school for fear of them being better educated than themselves. In many cases, it is the parents holding back future generations. Yet the activists and self-interest groups blame white Australia for poor education outcomes and lack of opportunities for Indigenous Australia. Education is the key for Indigenous Australians to pull themselves out of the quagmire of welfare dependency and into a better lifestyle. People in these communities are furious about the government's plan to make income management strictly voluntary for all but a few. They fear that the vacuum from the loss of the card will be filled with more problems, more unrest, more violence and more crime. They fear the return of the chaos and dysfunction that the card was helping to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the government is tacking more money onto this legislation. They've plucked another $65 million to throw at alcohol and drug services, to fix the problems that neither major party has been able to solve for decades. There are people in these communities who are paying over $100 or $150 for what's called a 'pillow'—a five-litre cask of wine. And in some areas they're paying $200 to $300 for a bottle of rum. So we're going to put in more health services, like dialysis machines, and that's going to solve the problem? Whereas if you restrict the money that they have, so that they're not spending it on this alcohol and drug abuse that is happening—and with the young ones—that might be a good start. It's been proven that it has worked and that it has helped. I'm reasonably confident this won't substitute for the good outcome produced by the cashless debit card. I know it won't. So another $65 million will be thrown at it. I'm sure the Australian people are going to be happy about that one. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government must prioritise investment in the skilled, homegrown Australian workforce to fill Australian jobs instead of outsourcing them to overseas workers. Higher immigration is not the solution. It's about getting Australians into jobs.</span>

It's a community of around eighteen hundred people and it's a community that's reinventing itself from the closure of the Mount Lyell copper mine over five years ago now. The Mountain Heights High School has some amazing teachers, and one of these is Alex Burgess-Norris, who has recently been recognised with a statewide award for her teaching and leadership excellence. Alex came to Mountain Heights School from right here in Canberra in 2019 on a two-year placement through the Teach for Australia Leadership Development Program. She's now in her fourth year at the school, teaching humanities, social science and English. </span>

This winter we only kept the lights on because we made the factories shut down. We put people out of jobs just to keep lights on. We did not have enough power because we have shut over four gigawatts of reliable power—mainly coal—and replaced it with weather-dependent energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland government trumpets today that its new $780 million wind farm will power 280,000 homes but it will only do that when the wind blows, which is only about a third of the time. The other two-thirds of the time, we will be left in the dark. For $780 million, this project will create just 15 permanent jobs. That comes in at $52 million per job—great deal. But wait, there's a lot more. The Queensland government does not have $780 million, so they're going to have to borrow $780 million. So the plan is that we're going to borrow millions more from the Chinese government to buy Chinese-built wind turbines so that we can destroy our local manufacturing industry and give China more of our jobs. What a great deal for the people of Queensland!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That will be the outcome here, because Europe has already tried this failed strategy, and it's failed catastrophically there. Europe has lost almost a quarter of its aluminium capacity thanks to an overreliance on renewable energy. You cannot run the Boyne Island aluminium smelter near Gladstone on a weather-dependent power system. There are thousands of Queensland jobs now at risk because of the Queensland government's ill-thought-through energy policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Queensland government were serious about jobs and about reducing carbon emissions, they would be building clean coal, gas and nuclear power plants. We have all of that energy under our feet and all of those resources here but we refuse to use it, which is a national crime. We are not using our own God-given energy resources. Instead, we rely on imported solar and wind turbines that will cost us much of our manufacturing industry and cost all Australians more for their basic power needs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I rise today to speak in solidarity with the women of Iran. Since the brutal death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died in custody after being detained by the country's morality police, protests have erupted across the country. The people of Iran, led by incredibly brave women who have taken to the streets in defiance of their government and its laws that require them to wear coverings on their head and to wear loose clothing, are fighting back. They are fighting for their basic human right: the right to choose. As they're fighting, they're taking off their hijabs and burning them. They're even cutting off their hair in solidarity. The chants at the rallies declare, 'We'll support our sisters and women, life and liberty.' These protests are unprecedented. But they are also, sadly, being met with military force, and there are casualties, many of which are not reported. The violence must stop and the oppression must stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand with the brave women and girls in Iran. Women's and girls' rights are human rights, and they must be universal. All women and girls deserve to be respected and to live free from violence and oppression, whatever country they come from. I stand in solidarity with the women and girls in Iran and across the globe who are fighting for their fundamental rights. Thank you to those brave women and girls for fighting for the rights of all our daughters and of girls everywhere.</span>

Every 20 hours in Australia, an Australian is diagnosed with cerebral palsy. It is the most common physical disability in childhood in Australia. When I was younger, my Sunday school teacher had severe cerebral palsy. I learned from her that people deserve to get as much out of life as possible. This is why I've joined STEPtember. I know many people with cerebral palsy. My fundraising will go to multiple initiatives to support the cerebral palsy community such as essential research, telepractice, programs for youth and babies at risk, and rural and regional support, which is vital.</span>

During a parliamentary sitting period it is so simple; I'm getting well and truly above my 10,000 steps. For non-sitting periods it's a little bit more challenging, and on Saturdays it's damn near impossible.</span>

I will be posting this speech on my Facebook page with the link to the donations. This is a great charity, and it helps many people's lives. In fact, one of the first things I did when I was a senator was assist a young girl in my town with cerebral palsy to get education support so she could sit her HSC. She's now about to graduate from university. It's these sorts of things we want to promote.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Madam Acting Deputy President Allman-Payne, I'm pleased to talk about an issue close to both our hearts: regional manufacturing in regional Queensland. The Albanese Labor government sees a future in Australian manufacturing. Our government sees a future for manufacturing in regional Australia. That is as clear as day when you look at our commitment of $150 million for the Cairns Marine Precinct. This investment in addition to the Queensland government's own $150 million commitment will go towards a much-needed once-in-a-generation facility in Cairns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cairns Marine Precinct project will create good, secure, local jobs. It will create more opportunities for local businesses. And it will help Cairns remain a world leader in marine manufacturing, maintenance and repair. The Cairns Marine Precinct project will help Cairns continue to be a key strategic player in the defence of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is investments like this that make sense for our government—investments that give back to communities, that ensure workers have secure jobs they can build their futures on. And it was investment like this that those opposite turned their noses up at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Leichhardt is in staunch opposition to this commitment. Despite widespread community support when we announced this funding, his response on whether he would match it was, 'No. In a word absolutely no.' It's not a surprise—not from the LNP. They dared Holden to leave, and it did. They slashed R&amp;D support to manufacturing. They shut the doors on thousands of apprentices and trainees. They sent trainees overseas. It was Labor that brought them home. They have never met a manufacturing job that they wouldn't casualise. You can't count on the LNP to back manufacturing, but you can count on a Labor government, because we know just how important it is to make things right here at home.</span>

What an amazing job you've done. I'm delighted to announce that the Commonwealth of Australia has reached its net zero target under the United Nations Paris climate agreement 30 years early. Well done, everyone. Senator Babet, well done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Assistant Minister McAllister for the definition she used in the Senate chamber during the Climate Change Bill. Article 4 of the UN Paris climate agreement says net zero is a balance between human production of emissions and removal of those emissions by environmental sinks. Our country has so many forests that Australia already sequesters, sinks, three times more carbon dioxide than we produce. Worldwide forests and oceans sink three-quarters of human production. Under the government's own definition, Australia is already at net zero, and the rest of the world is not far behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Paris Agreement definition of net zero ends with these words: 'in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty'. The UN Paris Agreement allows development. That's great news for our Project Iron Boomerang. Yet notice the last part, 'eradicate poverty'. If the Albanese government takes measures under its Climate Change Act that increase poverty in Australia, it will be in breach of the UN Paris climate agreement that the Liberal-National government signed. Yet high energy prices from insane energy policies are increasing inflation, destroying wealth, destroying jobs and opportunity, and forcing people into poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our human carbon dioxide production is not breaching the UN's Paris Agreement. Instead, the destruction of baseload power in this country and worldwide is breaching that agreement, and it does not require that action. The Albanese government cannot pick and choose which elements of the UN Paris Agreement it uses. One Nation will hold this government to the letter of the UN agreement Australia signed, and that is simple: climate zealotry and deceit must not push one person into poverty—not one person. Not one. None.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I rise in relation to an article which appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review </span>this morning entitled, 'Labor "at it again" in surprise move on dividends'. It's by John Kehoe, an outstanding economics editor at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>. I quote from the first paragraph:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese government has shocked investors by proposing to retrospectively stop companies paying shareholders fully franked dividends that are funded by capital raisings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it about the Australian Labor Party and franking credits? They just won't leave them alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three fundamental issues. There are three reasons why this proposal—this thought bubble from those opposite—is wrong. First, it is absurd, absolutely absurd, to apply retrospectivity—and this is what the exposure draft of the legislation says—all the way back to payments, distributions, which have been made at or after 12 noon by legal time in the ACT on 19 December 2016. That's more than five years ago. That's what they want the law to apply to: distributions already made to shareholders more than five years ago. It's outstanding. How can you comply with the law when you do something five years before the law's introduced? You don't have to be a constitutional lawyer to work out that there's something wrong with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, when you actually read the details of the legislation, it's extraordinarily complicated with respect to effect and purpose of capital raisings. Can I give you my considered legal advice, on the basis of 28 years as a commercial corporate lawyer. It's a swamp. The only people who are going to make money out of it are the tax lawyers and the tax accountants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, it's totally disingenuous. It says it relies on a government announcement made in 2016 when Scott Morrison was Treasurer. We're going all the way back to that. You don't have to be Michelle Grattan to work out that if a proposal didn't come into legislation after 2016, into this place by now, it was a political dead duck. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  It has never been more important to make more of the essential vaccines and medicines that we need right here in Australia, like lifesaving mRNA vaccines. Despite the need for urgency, despite the need to put the nation's best interests first and despite the need for cooperation, we had the former Morrison government reported as saying they would support any bid to bring mRNA manufacturing to Australia, only if it were anywhere but Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, just this month, I was proud to be at the announcement of the location of Moderna's first Southern Hemisphere mRNA manufacturing facility at Monash University in Melbourne in Victoria, because the truth is that a project of this scale, this importance and this size couldn't be anywhere else. Victoria is Australia's home of medical research and manufacturing. It's home to 18 world-leading medical research institutes, including the Doherty and Burnet institutes, now well known to all through the pandemic. It's home to one of the largest medical science workforces in the country; home to the world's leading international pharmaceutical manufacturers; home to top universities, including Monash University, where the first Australian mRNA vaccine candidate was invented; and home to excellent public hospitals, with over 40 directly involved in clinical research and trials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victoria is Australia's science and innovation capital because of the sustained vision and investment of the Andrews Labor government and of our medical research and manufacturing communities for more than 20 years. That vision has well and truly paid off for the people of Victoria and Australia, with growing international investment, thousands of good, secure jobs and, of course, better health and better lives too.</span>

You mainlanders make an okay drop, but Tassie wine is special. Mainlanders know it; they come in droves to Tassie to sample our wine and eat our cheese. They spend up big, and a lot of jobs in our state rely on the tourists who come for our wines.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last few years, a grant program run by the government helped our wine producers open cellar doors to sell directly to tourists. More cellar doors equals more tourists and more jobs. Now this grant is in danger. It's normally announced in July, but this year: silence. This is a retrospective grant, so wine producers have built it into their business plan and they're anxiously waiting to hear if the program is continuing and wondering if they'll take a financial hit if it isn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've visited local wine producers. The people who run the vineyards aren't millionaires. They're mum-and-dad operators having a red-hot go at running their own business. They've told me that, without this grant, they might have to put off staff. Without these grants, plans for expansion might not happen—expansion which other businesses in the area are relying on. This is just the latest blow for them. In the past few years, they've lost exports to China, lost tourist revenue through COVID and suffered catastrophic bushfires in 2016 and 2019. They're also facing a third year of crop-threatening La Nina rains.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is reviewing all grants programs at the moment, and I know that money is tight, but these businesses are worth investing in. They put our tourist spots on the map, they win international awards for their wine, they bring in tourists and employ local people. We can't leave these businesses in limbo any longer. The government needs to announce that the Australian Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant program will run again this year. I urge them to do it as soon as possible.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  As a senator, sometimes an issue comes to your attention that is so egregious that you have no choice but to act. For me, this was in 2016 when I learnt that, unknowingly, tens of thousands of Australians have for years been paying overseas child traffickers to traffic at-risk children from their families to be exploited in so-called orphanages. That's right, colleagues. Good-hearted Australians and their children were paying to have an orphanage tourism experience that they are led to believe will assist these so-called orphans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality, however, is far different. Over 90 per cent of children in these institutions are not orphans. They are often terribly abused and they are trained to smile and to put on a show for the constant parade of paying visitors from all over the world. Good-hearted Australians, with the best of intentions, find the prospect of assisting orphans so compelling that they don't do any due diligence on the facility or on the children themselves. It is, quite simply, the perfect 21st century scam. No-one wants to believe that, instead of doing good, they have effectively paid for the trafficking and the exploitation of children. It is a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise globally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, consider this: in Australia, we know the damage that long-term institutionalised care does to our own children, which is why we closed orphanages. We would never, ever, have people paying to visit our children in care. So why on earth do we think it is okay to do this to other people's children, simply because they were born in developing countries? We have created this trade, and now we have a responsibility to end it. I look forward to continuing to work with my parliamentary colleagues to stamp out this hideous practice. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  It was announced in May this year that an Albanese Labor government would provide $4 million in funding to the Clifford Craig research hub based at the Launceston General Hospital. This funding would allow for a boost in research performed by the Clifford Craig Foundation, which will lead to improved health outcomes for northern Tasmanians. The Clifford Craig Foundation, based in northern Tasmania, has been at the forefront of medical research in Tasmania. This funding will ensure that a world-class, fit-for-purpose facility can continue to develop the foundation's stellar reputation. The facility will operate as an all-encompassing hub to harness medical research but also to attract the best doctors and clinical staff to northern Tasmania so that we can improve general health outcomes for all Tasmanians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This funding will also benefit Tasmania's health system, particularly in the areas of clinical research and education and training. As well as having the full support of the Clifford Craig Foundation, the proposed hub has the support of St.LukesHealth, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the Launceston Health Hub. This $4 million commitment from our government will ensure that the capital works of the project are completed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have dragged their feet and refused to invest in the health of Tasmanians for too many years. It's evident that the Liberal government didn't care when they were in office. What they did, in fact, was cut health services to regions in Tasmania. When Tasmania was in the middle of the omicron wave of the pandemic, they cut the psychological support that Tasmanians badly needed. Labor built Medicare and will ensure that it is protected. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going forward, we have a strong record of investing in medical research as well as direct services to benefit all Tasmanians, and we will build on that record, because Labor cares about our health. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victorians are sick of the economic mismanagement. The state has a projected debt of $170 billion plus. That is greater than the combined debt levels of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. Victorians have had enough of the government interfering in their lives, their businesses and their homes, with absurd overreach, like the permanent pandemic powers which have enabled one man to act like a quasi-dictator. Victorians have had enough of the erosion of their parental rights and seeing their children exposed to inappropriate sexualised content in the classroom.

Victorians want to move on. Victorians want to heal. They want room to breathe and to live their lives without fear. Victorians: remember this November, and never forget what you went through. Victorians: make your voice heard. Chairman Dan—he's got to go.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Nearly two years ago to this day, a global tragedy unfolded off the west coast of Tasmania. At remote Strahan Beach, near Macquarie Harbour, over 470 whales were stranded. Despite the valiant efforts of conservation volunteers, local communities, aquaculture workers and scientists, a big majority of those whales perished. In an almost eerie coincidence, exactly two years to the date of that global tragedy—Australia's biggest whale stranding ever—we've had another whale stranding off the coast of Tasmania. Over 250 pilot whales were stranded. This followed the very rare stranding of 14 sperm whales on King Island just a few days earlier. Sperm whales are very rare in the waters off Tasmania and are very rarely beached. Why did this happen? Nobody knows. There are a lot of theories out there, but nobody knows. Can we do more to stop this from happening? Yes, we can. Are there gaps in our knowledge and research? Yes, there are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I would like to thank once again all the legends who have been down there in the freezing cold and heartbreaking conditions working to save these whales. We owe it to them as we do to the many frustrated Tasmanians, Australians and, indeed, members of the global community who are horrified to see this happening again. We owe it to them to do more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be proposing a one- or two-day hearing through the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee to look at what we can do and what the federal government can do to assist the state government in its efforts should this happen again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  An Australian dies almost every hour—yes, every single hour—from alcohol, drug and gambling harm. One in four Australians will struggle with the misuse of alcohol and other drugs or of gambling in their lifetime. Note, these numbers describe the individual impact, without the compounding human, social and economic cost for all Australians and Australia. Evidence, data and lived professional experience should weigh heavily in decision-making because it is those things, not emotion or well-meaning intention, that must triumph and trigger the right action every single time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are real people in those numbers. Indigenous Australians as a group are much less likely to drink alcohol, but those who do, do so at more harmful and dangerous levels. Our mean age at death from alcohol attributable causes—cirrhosis, organ failure, brain damage, haemorrhage—is about 35 years, every one of those deaths preventable. In South Australia, alcohol related hospitalisations are three to four times higher than among the general population. The representation is highest from those in remote and very remote regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Rethink Addiction conference had a clear message of hearing from those with lived experience rather than through representations constructed by other people. I heard from them that real change is possible with frank and fearless conversation, dispelling myths and ending the stigma that stops people from getting help. Data is a big issue. No, actually, it's a significant issue. It's there, and we need to use it. It is, however, not often easily interrogated or comparable across borders, making it easier to hide or even ignore the true impact. That has to be addressed. We can do better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  Last week marked 10 years since the murder of Jill Meagher, who was attacked by a stranger while walking home from a night out with friends. Her murder sparked an impassioned national debate on women's safety—another impassioned national debate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year or two since, a senseless and awful act of violence has made the headlines and briefly captured the nation's attention. The murders of Eurydice Dixon, Aya Maasarwe and Courtney Herron and the murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children—these vile acts galvanised the women's movement and its allies to take to the streets to light candles, to write to their politicians pleading for action, reclaiming the night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what changes? In the 10 years since Jill Meagher's murder at least 650 women have been killed violently. Many don't make the news, especially if they're women of colour, First Nations women or women with disabilities, and the majority of are not killed by strangers but by people they know. The long-overdue National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children must be fully funded. It must drive cultural change, and no woman should be turned away when she reaches out to a service for help.</span>

When asked on 28 July 2022 if the government was intending to remove compulsory income management from the Northern Territory, you told the Senate no. The instruments that give effect to the operation of compulsory income management via the BasicsCard are due to sunset this Friday. Can you confirm that the government will not let these instruments sunset this week and will extend the operation of compulsory income management?</span>

I'm simply making the observation that the statement I provided to the Senate on the last occasion that I was asked this question was the correct answer. I think the difficulty that the opposition is having with this whole cashless debit card issue is that there's a lack of understanding that, although you had this sort of policy that you were all committed to and you believed it was working and successful in the communities that you'd applied it to, all of the evidence that has now come out—</span>

All of the places that you've just outlined are places where we are making changes to the operation of the cashless debit card. I think the first and fundamental point—and, again, I hate to lecture the opposition—is that the Labor Party took this policy to the last election. We went to the people of Australia and we said: 'We don't believe that this system of income management'—that you had established in an ideological fashion—'is working, and we intend to change it.' And that's what we're doing. So, today and tomorrow, that's exactly what we're going to be doing in this chamber. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When parliament returns after this sitting week it will be to hand down the October budget, and the Treasurer and I announced last week that we will release the final budget outcome for the 2021-22 financial year this Wednesday.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we've been very upfront about the serious challenges facing the economy and the substantial pressures hitting the budget. One of the biggest pressures, of course, is the management of the trillion dollars of debt that was left to us by the former government. With higher interest rates, that debt will now cost the budget more to service, with billions and billions of dollars that we will need to find in the coming years that has not been provisioned for. That, of course, is on top of the funding that was promised by the previous government for the last financial year that did not get out the door to benefit Australians, much of which will pass over to the next financial year. Whether it's COVID support, delayed infrastructure projects or support for flood victims, there's at least $6 billion in there that those opposite promised to spend in the last financial year but didn't, and we will now have to pay for these as they flow over through the October budget. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer and I have been very clear that the former government did not make provision for a lot of the costs that are going to have to be managed by this government. This is a government of grown-ups. This is a government that actually does its work, that is methodical in its analysis, that weighs up the evidence for policy decisions, that makes those often difficult decisions when we go through the budget process. That is our commitment to the Australian people. That's why they elected us; they wanted someone to manage the budget responsibly, to be fiscally responsible and to make room for all those areas Australians value in terms of their services and access to support.</span>

Thank you, Senator Payman. We know Australians are doing it really tough, which is why our first priority is delivering responsible cost-of-living relief—responsible because it needs to take some of the pressure off people but also grow the capacity of the economy and not make the Reserve Bank's job harder. A great example of this is our childcare policy, which every member on this side is so proud of, with the legislation being introduced into the House this week. This will be a game changer for family budgets, for our workforce and for the productive capacity of our economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from implementing our election commitments, which are obviously important in terms of our economic plan for Australia—things like cheaper child care, cheaper medicines and fixing the aged-care crisis—we've also had to deal with issues left behind by the previous government. This includes around $5½ billion in unavoidable spending. Around $3½ billion of this was extending COVID relief payments in line with isolation requirements, vaccine eligibility, support for aged-care facilities and replenishing medical stockpiles—all unfunded by the previous government—and around $2 billion was in relation to disaster recovery. It is all necessary funding but was not provided for. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I think all Australians were concerned to see this apparent cyberattack that occurred over the last few days involving Optus data, because Australians expect that when they hand over their personal data, particularly to corporations, every effort will be made to keep it safe from harm. As a result of this data breach, unfortunately it appears millions of Australians have been impacted in an unfortunate way. As Senator Paterson recognises, the information we have to date is that the breach involves people's names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, residential addresses and, for some customers, passport and drivers licence numbers being for sale on the dark web. This is very concerning to many Australians. I note, however, that Optus has advised that while a wide range of data has been breached, according to Optus, payment details and account passwords have not been compromised. That is at least some saving grace for Australians who have experienced this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the government was advised of this matter last Wednesday, 21 September, a range of government bodies have been working to contain the incident, including the Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the Australian Federal Police. For obvious reasons, I won't go into the technical assistance and cybersecurity advice being provided to Optus, or the wider efforts to help protect Australians, but I can assure Senator Paterson and all Australians that hundreds of Australian government staff have been working long into the night and over the weekend to stem the damage flowing from this. I want to thank them for their efforts. The Minister for Home Affairs has of course been continually briefed since this issue commenced and I know also that the Leader of the Opposition was briefed today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am assured that the minister herself was continually briefed and has worked with the agencies to stem the damage flowing from that. So, as I say, I don't think that's a fair characterisation of the minister's performance or approach to this.

Let's not forget that when the opposition was in power, only one in four Commonwealth entities met the Essential Eight cybersecurity obligations in 2021, according to the Audit Office. The then government, now opposition, released a ransomware bill one year after the opposition released a discussion paper calling for a ransomware strategy. I think any independent observer would recognise a good performance— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, Australia now has one of the poorest paid parental leave schemes in the OECD. We're stuck at 18 weeks paid leave with two weeks for partners paid at just minimum wage and without superannuation, a pay cut for many working families at a critical moment in their lives. Meanwhile, the rest of the OECD has overtaken us, with the average period of paid parental leave now around 52 weeks and close to full wage replacement in many places. Australians and organisations from across the country, parents, women, unions and employers are united in their call for more paid parental leave for Australia's parents, especially mothers. This was one of the most common and most united points of discussion at the recent Jobs and Skills Summit, and not a voice was raised against it. When will your government increase the length of paid parental leave?</span>

As the preamble to the question implied, this was discussed at the Jobs and Skills Summit. There is a lot of support for extending the paid parental leave system in Australia. Of course, it was a scheme that was put in place by a former Labor government, because it's Labor governments that do these big things and that answer these big policy challenges. Whilst I'm not here to announce any extension of the PPL scheme, as Minister for Women it's something that I am looking at closely, if and when we can make room in the budget for it. We're also dealing with significant deficits across the forward estimates. We have a trillion dollars of debt, which, as I said in my last question, is getting more costly to manage. There is no shortage of very good ideas that the government would like to fund if we had the capacity to do so.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I announced the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, chaired by Sam Mostyn, which has a fantastic group of 13 women. They will be providing advice to government, and I have no doubt that PPL and improvements to the PPL scheme will be a part of the work that they do. The former minister responsible for implementing the PPL scheme, Jenny Macklin, is also on that task force, and it came up at the first meeting. I think there is agreement about the fact that we need to improve our PPL scheme, but the budget is under real stress and I have to manage those challenges as well.</span>

We can afford to increase the length of leave and the rate of payment, and pay superannuation on it. Rather than give a $9,000 tax cut to the 227 politicians in this building and to the very well off, we can redirect stage 3 tax cuts to the parents who need it most. Will you set aside the stage 3 tax cuts and instead improve paid parental leave? </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  You mentioned Jenny Macklin. In her second reading speech on the introduction of the first paid parental leave bill—the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010—she drew attention to the need to pay superannuation on paid parental leave. But here we are, 12 years on, and there is no progress on that front. We must make sure that mothers in particular don't find themselves living in poverty after a lifetime of work and care. Why should the price of care be poverty in old age? Will your government ensure that all periods of parental leave are covered by superannuation payments so that parents aren't left behind? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is absolutely a priority for this government, as you would have seen in some of the policies that we took to the election and some of the ways we raised the level of interest in women's economic equality at the Jobs and Skills Summit. I do look forward to working with anyone in this chamber who wants to genuinely progress economic equality. Obviously, super on paid parental leave has always been part of the discussion. I have no doubt that the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce will be looking at this and providing me with advice in the near term.</span>

After a decade of the Liberal government, Australia is more dependent than ever on a single market for our exports. Placing all your trade eggs in one basket has proven to be bad economic strategy. The COVID-19 global pandemic, supply chain volatility—which has been exacerbated by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine—and Chinese trade blockages have exposed the growing risk for Australian exporters, jobs and prosperity. To address these challenges, the Albanese Labor government is implementing a trade diversification plan that will provide opportunities for Australian businesses to gain new market access into major markets and facilitate inward investment to help build the infrastructure for the green economy.</span>

Earlier this month I did join ministers from 13 other partners across the Indo-Pacific in Los Angeles to launch negotiations for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Together, IPEF members represent over 40 per cent of global GDP and, for Australia, eight of our top 10 trading partners. At the meeting it was agreed that negotiations would cover a range of new and emerging issues on trade, supply chains, clean energy, decarbonisation and infrastructure, as well as tax and anticorruption. Launching IPEF negotiations is a significant step in the future of greater economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. It brings together the United States; north and south Asian partners, including India; and most importantly, our Pacific neighbour, Fiji. IPEF is an important element of the Albanese Labor government's trade diversification agenda.</span>

I understand the TGA received an application from a doctor to amend the Poisons Standard in relation to ivermectin. I think that kicks off an automatic process. The application is to remove those restrictions that were placed on ivermectin when it began being prescribed to treat COVID-19. So the application is to enable GPs to prescribe it. I think that kicks off a process which is automatic in the TGA. The application is currently open for public consultation until the end of this month. Then it will be discussed by the ACMS at their next meeting on 9 November. An interim decision is expected by February 2023 and a final decision later in 2023. In terms of advice, whilst this process is underway, separately there hasn't been any change to the advice from the TGA that led them to put those restrictions on ivermectin as a prescription for COVID-19. That hasn't changed.</span>

There is a range of academic research, and not all of it would be putting the case as you put it. I've seen other studies that have been done that show there is no clinical benefit from using ivermectin. That is not unusual with some of these trials; it isn't unusual to have a significant difference of opinion. </span>

I don't accept the position you are putting here, Senator Roberts. I understand you have a particular view on this, but I believe that the Therapeutic Goods Administration have operated very well during this pandemic. The Prime Minister has made it clear that, at the right time—when we are through the pandemic—we will definitely have a review of some sort, looking at our response to the pandemic. </span>

The evidence that's before the TGA is that there did need to be restrictions placed on it. It's not the only drug where there are restrictions placed on its use. There are other medicines that cannot be prescribed by GPs, or they have to go through a process. Based on the information the TGA has provided, they see good reason to impose those restrictions. That other process, which I spoke of in the first answer, will report back on those dates that I've outlined.</span>

The rise of the digital platforms and the use of modern technology have created a whole host of new privacy challenges and risks that we saw over the weekend, including the collection and the use of a vast amount of personal information by social media platforms. Australians should have better control over how their personal data is collected and used, and confidence that when they engage with a business or a government agency their data will be protected and not misused.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:41</span>):  My question, with minimal notice, is to Senator Watt, representing the Attorney-General. Former senator Rex Patrick is in the Federal Court challenging the Information Commissioner for unreasonable days in dealing with freedom of information reviews. These delays impact everyone who is trying to get answers from the government. While in opposition, now Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus provided an affidavit supporting Patrick's case. Despite this, under the now new Attorney-General, the Commonwealth continues to oppose the case. As at 1 August 2022 the total external legal costs incurred by the Commonwealth in opposing Patrick's case were a whopping $301,667.12. Consistent with the sworn affidavit of now Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, and noting that some matters remain unresolved more than 1,000 days after referral, will Labor now support the case of former senator Patrick to prevent unreasonable delays in dealing with freedom of information reviews?</span>

                  </a>  Senator Shoebridge's question goes to legal action undertaken by former senator Rex Patrick, who I think all of us would recognise made a bit of a name for himself here in the accountability arena.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In direct answer to the question, this matter, as you have recognised, is currently before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, so it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment. But there can be no doubt whatsoever as to this government's commitment to transparency, in contrast with the abhorrent and wilful ignorance of transparency that we saw for 10 years under the former government. We are on the verge of introducing legislation to introduce and establish a new national anticorruption commission. I see Senator McKenzie welcoming that, and I wonder why it didn't happen for any of the 10 years that she and her colleagues were in government. Perhaps one day we can talk about that outside the chamber and she can illuminate me on that. But that is one example of how this government intends to be far more transparent about its actions than what we saw for 10 years under the coalition. As I say, this matter before the AAT will be resolved, and that's the appropriate forum in which to discuss this matter.</span>

That's an increase of some 50 per cent in that year. Would you agree, Minister, that any funding for the Information Commissioner might be better spent not in court arguing against someone suing against unreasonable delays but instead staffing the office to respond on time?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think all of us have noticed that over the last week we have been closely monitoring and responding to another difficult weather system, particularly over central west and northern New South Wales, as well as some severe thunderstorms in South-East Queensland. The worst of the flooding over the weekend was in the Namoi River in Gunnedah, with several streets, low-lying properties and businesses inundated. I know that all of our thoughts go out to the communities that have been affected, particularly throughout New South Wales. There were also strong fears that Lismore would again see localised flooding, but fortunately forecasts there were downgraded. The Wilson River, which runs through Lismore, only peaked to minor flooding levels this time, well short of the level required to top the flood levy there.</span>

The action that the SES took in getting ready for these events before they hit went a long way to ensuring that people were kept safe. As of late yesterday, the New South Wales SES had received 898 requests for assistance, including 64 flood rescue activations. South-East Queensland was also affected, particularly the Gold Coast hinterland. </span>

As I've previously told the chamber, the Bureau of Meteorology has officially declared a La Nina event for Australia, with above-average rainfall predicted for most of the east coast of the country this summer. Given that this will be our third successive La Nina event as a country—something that I'm advised is incredibly rare—the risk of flash flooding and severe flooding is even higher than we have seen previously. That's why it's vital that our emergency management agencies are working to their best ability to make sure that we are prepared.</span>

Last week I announced Mr Brendan Moon as the new coordinator-general of this new agency.

That's what we've done in establishing a new agency, in appointing one of Australia's foremost disaster professionals to head it and in taking additional action as well. It's why teams from NEMA have been out meeting with all states and territories to discuss their preparedness plans well ahead of this high-risk weather season. The briefings included a scenario based discussion based on the BoM outlook to better understand the risks and enhance collective preparedness for the upcoming season.</span>

Last sitting this government introduced amendments to the disaster ready fund legislation. These amendments will ensure that the full $200 million allocated in the fund per year is spent on disaster mitigation while maintaining our commitment to support communities as they recover from disasters. We've also been rolling out important funding in New South Wales under the Emergency Response Fund for disaster mitigation projects. It's what Australians deserve, and it's a far cry from the 'I don't hold a hose'— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As senators would know, the Albanese government has committed to implementing the Uluru statement in full, and we will hold a referendum to enshrine an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice in the Constitution in this term of parliament. This will be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to recognise our First Nations people in our founding legal document and to make Australia a better place for everybody. No matter what side of politics you're on, I think we can all agree that something needs to be done and that, as a country, we can do better. </span>

The government will this week convene the first formal meeting of the referendum working group. This group will provide advice to government on the big questions that need to be considered in the coming months: firstly, the timing to conduct a successful referendum; secondly, refining the proposed constitutional amendment and question; and, thirdly, information on the Voice necessary for a successful referendum.</span>

A voice to parliament will be about hearing from the grassroots—from the community—about what can be done better. It's a direct line to parliament to make a practical difference in areas like housing, keeping children in schools, education, health, infrastructure and community safety. It's about local communities finding local solutions to local problems, and the idea of the Voice came from those communities. It's about ensuring First Nations Australians are heard—that they're heard on policies, that they're heard on laws, that they're heard on what works. I would encourage everybody in this chamber to get involved in the discussion, even if they disagree or have a difference of opinion, and work together to bring about this nation-building change.</span>

It's about respect, really, isn't it? It's about listening to First Nations people. It's about ensuring that the longest continuous living culture in the world is reflected in our country's constitution, our founding document. Everyone wants to work together to make Australia a better place. That's why all of us have a role to play in this debate. It is about talking to friends. It is about listening to what is being proposed, even if you have a different view, but being part of the discussion. It's not a radical proposal; it's a fair and practical change. I urge everybody to get involved in the discussion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

While income management legislation in the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 does not sunset, it operates through a number of legislative instruments that sunset every 10 years. These instruments enable income management to operate in specific locations and/or income management measures. Six of these legislative instruments were due to sunset on 1 October 2022. I think that is what you were referring to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order for the government to consult effectively with communities on the future of income management, the Attorney-General has agreed to the deferral of the six instruments for a period of 12 months. Our consultation with communities will then direct the future of income management. Product-level blocking technology will be maintained under our government's plan to support participants and merchants under the enhanced income management program. It will reduce the stigma associated with the business card under the current income management program.</span>

When the election was called, the former Prime Minister had a total of 128 unanswered parliamentary questions on notice, and it wasn't just parliamentary questions on notice that were left unanswered.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was all talk from those opposite that, indeed, there are 22 overdue questions on notice from the Prime Minister alone already—22! Senator Farrell likes to remind this chamber that the previous government was in office for nine to 10 years. Now he comes in and says, 'And there were 128 questions that were overdue from that time frame.' Well you've only been there, as you like to remind us, Senator Farrell, for some few months, yet you've already racked up 22 to the Prime Minister alone that are overdue. It was all talk. You have broken your promises to this chamber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what some of those promises were. Senator Watt said just last year in June: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We deserve answers and transparency. It is not negotiable—and it should not be negotiable—for the Prime Minister to comply with the standing orders and properly answer these questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, why then is it that Mr Albanese, through Senator Farrell, is now trying to negotiate around whether or not he complies with the standing orders in terms of answering these questions? Remarkably, Senator Watt was still going on with some of these claims. Even in question time today he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there can be no doubt whatsoever as to this government's commitment to transparency, in contrast with the abhorrent and wilful ignorance of transparency that we saw for 10 years under the former government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently there is doubt as to this government's commitment to transparency. Despite what Senator Watt was saying in question time today, despite the fact he claimed that adhering to these standing orders was not negotiable, the government is walking away from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's not just Senator Watt. Senator Ayres, reflecting directly upon me in the role Senator Farrell just referenced, said back in November 2020:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is high time Senator Birmingham signalled a change in approach, in terms of accountability and ministerial accountability in this place, from what we've seen in … a stoic refusal to provide timely responses to questions on notice …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ayres was there with Senator Watt arguing for timely responses. Now here they are lining up the excuses.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Marielle Smith, in quite an honest and reasonable contribution very early on in her time here, said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I am relatively new to this place, but it doesn't really seem like an unreasonable request to me that these questions are answered within 30 days.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That, presumably, is why the standing orders are there: within 30 days. Labor senator after Labor senator used to say it should be within 30 days. Now, of course, they're failing in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even those no longer with them—it's always nice to reflect on former senator Keneally, who could put things very directly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… standing orders require the government to answer questions on notice and to answer them in a certain time frame. It is not a technicality to avoid accountability. It is your responsibility as a government to be answerable to this chamber. It is the responsibility of the government to be accountable to the questions posed by senators, and it is your responsibility as a government to conform to the standing orders. The standing orders require the government to answer questions posed by senators, including on notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Various Labor senators, present and past, arguing very clearly that they believed questions should be answered within the time frame of the standing orders and that they would hold to a higher standard in that regard. This is a government that knows how to grandstand. We can see that, from everything. They know how to grandstand. But they are already showing themselves to be incapable in the delivery—grandstanding, yes; delivery, no. Guess what? It's not just the 22 questions to the Prime Minister that are overdue; there are in fact 117 questions to the new government that are already overdue—117 questions that the government have racked up in various places and already are determining are not possible for them to answer. So, despite all these grand claims that we have seen about answering questions on time, this government has shown itself to be hypocritical in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not just hypocritical in terms of this area of accountability. There are numerous areas of accountability in which this government is showing that it is not living up to the rhetoric that it took to the election, to the rhetoric that it deployed in this chamber previously or indeed to the claims that it still tries to make about itself. Take the ministerial standards. The new ministerial code of conduct was unveiled with great fanfare by the new Prime Minister. And yet, then, it became apparent that his ministers had neither read the code of conduct nor ensured compliance with the code of conduct. The unveiling of the code of conduct came some time after the ministers had been sworn in. The ministers were sworn in, and then the code of conduct was unveiled. You would assume that ministers had been informed of it before it was publicly released. You'd certainly hope that's the case. Subsequent to that, at least three ministers have been forced to change their interests after it was publicly revealed they were in breach of the new code of conduct. The NDIS minister, Mr Shorten, the local government minister, Ms McBain, and the assistant trade minister in this place, Senator Ayres, all had to go through and make changes after the public disclosure of their breaches to the code of conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A government big on rhetoric about accountability and big on rhetoric about transparency won't answer its questions on time in this chamber. Its ministers have been found to be neither reading nor complying with the code of conduct. Indeed, we also had the issue raised by the Australian Greens in this chamber today about national cabinet's release of documents. Back in opposition, the Labor Party constantly complained about the secrecy surrounding deliberations of national cabinet. Mr Albanese and others were endlessly attacking the former Prime Minister and suggesting that he was 'obsessed with secrecy' over these issues. And yet, now Mr Albanese has confirmed, after his first national cabinet meeting, that the Commonwealth has not proposed changing practices in relation to the release of documents from national cabinet. As you heard from the questions of the Australian Greens today, not only are they not proposing changes but they're continuing to defend the decisions of the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not necessarily criticising their decision in that regard; it's the hypocrisy that I'm shining a spotlight on—the hypocrisy of a mob of Labor politicians who endlessly criticised and railed against the former government in relation to the way it handled such matters as the release of information and yet, when they came to office, simply went and continued past practice, ignoring all that they had to say before. They are the living embodiment of hypocrisy in the way in which they are conducting themselves in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said this about chamber management too—that's chamber management here. Again, a government that used to rail against the application of guillotines and complain about the curtailing of debate has now been more than happy to do so whenever it suits them, and not just in this chamber but, even more remarkably, in the other place. In the other place, where they have the numbers to be able to simply change the standing orders, they've done that. They've done that, basically embedding a permanent gag and guillotine in the standing orders of the House of Representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much for debate in the House of Representatives! So much for empowerment of the greater diversity of members of parliament in the House of Representatives! It now basically just takes a minister to declare that legislation is urgent. They don't have to give any reason. They don't have to say why it's urgent. They don't have to meet any other criteria in relation to its urgency. The minister just says it's urgent and then all of a sudden a range of automatic guillotines take effect. Once declared urgent a bill in the other place is subject to automatic guillotine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes collapse the consideration-in-detail phase of the debate in the House of Representatives, meaning that any amendments, government or otherwise, are simply moved together and voted on immediately. That's not a government committed to transparency. That's not a government committed to accountability. That's not a government committed to the proper functioning of a parliament. That's the behaviour of a government that simply wants to drive through its own way without any consideration for transparency, accountability or the proper functioning of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see with those opposite is that despite all the grand and lofty promises they made during their years in opposition, despite all the great criticisms that they tried to deliver, they are ultimately failing to live up to those standards. Mr Albanese, even when he was releasing his Code of Conduct for Ministers, claimed that they were committed to integrity, honesty and accountability, and that ministers in his government will observe standards of probity and governance. Where is the integrity and accountability when ministers breach the code of conduct and have to have it called out by the media, be shamed publicly into changing the way their affairs are ordered, and then try to deny that there was actually anything wrong? You have a government that claimed endlessly that it was frustrated in the delivery of answers when they were in opposition. They moaned endlessly that the then government was failing to adhere to the standing orders. They promised endlessly that they would do better but, then when it came to their behaviour, within just a few months they have racked up 117 overdue questions across a range of different areas of public policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 22 that I highlighted today to the Prime Minister were questions asked by my colleagues Senator Cash and Senator Bragg across different issues in relation to superannuation industry policy, in relation to workplace relations or in relation to the administration of government. They're not particularly tricky questions. These, at the early stages of the government, you would think are relatively straightforward questions for a government to get on and answer. So how, why is it the case that this government has been unable to do so in the time that they have had? They have had these questions for 30 days and yet the clock has seen them run over and fail to do so. There are 117 across all of the other portfolios.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy President, let it stand that this government is a government proven to be one who was all talk when it came to these sorts of standards pre-election. And now they're breaking their promises to the chamber, to the Australian people, to themselves even. No doubt they convinced themselves going into the election. And now they're breaking their promises to themselves as well. They're a government who will no doubt continue to grandstand and claim that they're doing better, that they're doing differently, when in fact the proof is in the data, the proof is in the behaviour, that they're letting themselves down, they're letting this chamber down and, ultimately, they're letting the Australian people down.</span>

Yet today what we see is that Mr Albanese has fallen over at the very first hurdle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In providing an explanation on behalf of the Prime Minister of Australia, what did we get from the minister representing the Prime Minister? Well, actually nothing—nothing but excuses and blame. You see, what the minister and the Prime Minister clearly fail to remember is that you are now in government. You set the standards by which you wanted the Australian people and this parliament to judge you: transparency, integrity and accountability. Yet on each one of those standards, with 117 questions overdue—and it's not like you had a short time in which to provide the answers; they are overdue now after over 30 days—you have failed in every regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate stated, when those in government were on the other side of the chamber, they were very demanding when it came to questions being answered on time. Yet now that they are in government, they don't hold themselves to that same standard of accountability. In June last year, just over 12 months ago, what did now Minister Watt say in relation to the failure to provide answers to questions on notice in a timely fashion? He said this: 'We deserve answers and transparency.' He went even further and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is not negotiable—and it should not be negotiable—for the Prime Minister to comply with the standing orders and properly answer these questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Prime Minister is now his Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is Prime Minister Albanese. According to what now Minister Watt said at the time, Mr Albanese has failed. Mr Albanese has decided that transparency is negotiable, even though it was not negotiable when they were in opposition and we were in government. Then, of course, Senator Marielle Smith said on 15 October 2019:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree. It is not an unreasonable request, in particular when you are the now Prime Minister of this country and you have gone to an election on the basis of integrity, on the basis of transparency and on the basis of accountability.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister should stand true to his words and ensure that at all times he complies with the standards that he himself set.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the code of conduct which Mr Albanese made great fanfare about when he announced it. This was going to be the code of conduct to end all codes of conduct, and yet what we've had is the Prime Minister himself—and they've only been in government for over 120 days—already failing the code of conduct that he himself signed off on. but what is worse, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has stated, the Prime Minister has been more than happy in the past to have several press conferences about the ministerial arrangements of the previous government, and yet when it comes to taking responsibility for his own government and answering questions, very serious questions, he is nowhere to be seen.</span>

While I understand all ministers were issued with a copy of the code of conduct, perhaps Mr Albanese didn't give them the instruction that they should also read the code conduct. Had Ms McBain read the code of conduct, she would have understood that she can't just transfer the shares to her husband. What did she say and what did Mr Albanese say? 'Nothing to see here. No breach of the code. There's nothing that has been done wrong.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you had the second minister, Minister Ged Kearney. She had an interest in a fund which had a number of holdings in a fund with significant exposure to health care despite having a portfolio in that area. But, again, according to the Prime Minister—who was big on transparency, integrity and accountability in the lead-up to the election—when his ministers are called out there is nothing to see here.</span>

                  </a>  He does—frivolously! He frivolously referred nine of his political opponents to the Australian Federal Police just to get a headline, because none of these referrals were in any way successful. But Attorney-General Dreyfus—for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record—was heavily invested in a fund which owned shares in Omni Bridgeway, a company which put out a press release—you can go online, google this and see it—praising a decision by the Attorney-General in litigation funding policy, a policy which strongly benefits that company. On any analysis, whether or not you are a minister in the Albanese government, how the Attorney-General of Australia would think this is a good idea is, quite frankly, unbelievable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is very typical, colleagues, of the Albanese government. What is good for the government when they are in opposition is not the standard that they are going to live by when they themselves get into government. This is the Prime Minister of Australia who has failed to answer very simple questions. According to the statistics, over 16 per cent of questions in the Senate are currently overdue. Sixteen per cent of the questions asked are overdue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets worse because, when you break down the 16 per cent, over 40 per cent of that 16 per cent that are actually overdue were directed to the Prime Minister of Australia. He has only been asked 48 questions on notice, yet he thinks this parliament, the Senate, is beneath him to respond. As I said, if you treat the opposition in this place with contempt, you are treating the Australian people with contempt. The Australian people, who believe in transparency, integrity and accountability, are being failed miserably by the Prime Minister of Australia. Transparency, integrity and accountability—those are words that, in the lead-up to an election, the Prime Minister will throw around happily, but, when he gets into government, it all goes out the window.</span>

Forty per cent—that is a big number, but when it comes down to it there are 22 questions. The Prime Minister doesn't want to answer these questions, but I'm going to read them out. I think it is important that these questions are on the public record to make sure those poor people up there in the public gallery can leave this chamber, go to the Queen's Terrace Cafe, have a double-shot cappuccino and understand that the Prime Minister of this country is snubbing his nose at this chamber and snubbing his nose at accountability.

They do not want to engage with being honest, transparent and accountable. That is the lesson here, fellow senators: we've got a Prime Minister's office who, quite frankly, don't care about this chamber. They do not care about accountability. We've got a government here who do not care about us. Estimates is going to be interesting; get lots of coffee for that!</span>

                  </a>  Minister Watt is very scared of Shane Stone—bring back Shane Stone! That'll scare him! It is very important, for people who believe in a liberal democracy, that governments are held to account. On a daily basis when we were in government we were held to account by the opposition—and that is important. As someone who has worked around the world in various different emerging democracies, I think it is so important for that government of whatever persuasion to be held to account. What we are seeing here is a government who are refusing to be held to account because they are refusing to answer simple questions about how they are spending money and how they are making decisions on behalf of the Australian people, and refusing to release pretty basic information. That is shameful. Shame on the Prime Minister.</span>

I'm reasonably sure that whilst this question was asked of the Prime Minister—I'm even going to give him credit and say this is probably not something he was personally responsible for—these details are able to be provided pretty easily and quickly by his EA, by anyone in his office. I know when I have hosted a function all these details are immediately available.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know those opposite have never seen a trough deep enough to get their snout in as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure those briefs would be sitting already sorted in someone's drawer—that's the information you get every time you host any sort of function, particularly in Parliament House. All this information is provided to you, and certainly the names of guests. You do not turn up to a function as a backbencher in the opposition without knowing who's going to be at events. There is no way the Prime Minister is turning up at any function, nor are any of his ministers or assistant ministers turning up at any events, without a list of all attendees. That would just be part of the event brief. But any event that they've ordered and they've organised would have all of that information. And I have no doubt that one of the reasons they don't want to provide this—because none of this information is being provided—is because the vintage Moet that they probably served may not align with the alleged blue-collar working values that they purport to support. The fact that that snout has delved into the trough, well and truly within the first—I'd like to say 120 days, I would have given it 120 minutes and they'd have been in. Within 120 minutes the taxpayer funded French champagne would have been provided. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the fact they don't even support Australian winemakers except Senator Farrell, we've got to give him credit for the Godfather. That's why they dined at Otis. The Otis group was only there because it's the only restaurant in Canberra to serve Senator Farrell's own wine. So we know Senator Farrell has an interest in the domestic wine market, particularly when it's supporting his own winery, but I think in any other instance we know those opposite—particularly at the far left of the chamber—love a good drop of a vintage French.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, these are the people who are all 'do as I say, not as I do', who we've been listening to bleat on about how they were going to be the bastions of integrity, the bastions of transparency, an honest government, and lift the standards. There were going to be no more mean girls. Everyone was going to be giving each other big hugs—all kumbaya. There wasn't going to be the tearing down. It was all going to be about support. It was all going to be love-ins. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got a two-minute statement tomorrow, and we've actually just lost a longstanding member of the Liberal Party, so I may give credit to him tomorrow. What I was planning to come and do was actually read out some of the misogynistic tweets I've received in the last seven days, because I actually thought it'd be interesting to see how the tone of politics has improved since the Albanese government has come in and called for this kinder parliament. I can tell you: it has got worse. And not only has it got worse for conservative women, not only has it got worse—I've got to tell you, there is a meme that came out today and it's hilarious. I think it's great. It's me, Bronwyn Bishop and Prue MacSween, and it's asking, 'Where's the factory that produces these?' As I replied to it, that must have been in response to: who are your dream dinner party guests? Then I got another one that was, 'Have Bronwyn Bishop and John Howard had a love child?' with a very flattering photo of me, which I sent to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, because we know he always claimed to be their love child. He responded to me, saying, 'Well, congratulations; the family's clearly expanding.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I digress. We're now talking about the tone, the parliamentary tone. But I'll tell you what we are going to see—the tone towards women absolutely descend. And we know where women are going to start being treated even worse than conservative women in this place and in the sewer of Twitter et cetera. It will be on worksites around this country, because we know those opposite are all talk but all delivery when it comes to union policy. As soon as John Setka gave you the call, as soon as those election results were in and John Setka was on the phone, you lot, quick as a flash: 'Quick, let's get rid of that ABCC. We've got to get rid of any security for women on building sites. We've got to get rid of any security for workers on building sites who don't subscribe to the CFMMEU.' We know how many hearings there've been, how many cases there've been. The CFMMEU just sees these fines as the cost of doing business. There is the most appalling treatment of women on building sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also hear them bleat on about cost of living. There's a housing shortage. We need to boost the building sector. But how is this going help? We're going to see building companies struggle even further to attract workers, to maintain workers and to keep their workplaces going and worksites operating, as the unions are given even more overreach of power. This is only going to get worse. If you don't think housing costs are going to increase, if you don't think building costs for businesses and commercial properties are going to increase, you guys live in la-la land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You guys, with everything you do, are making a bad situation worse. You add to inflationary pressures through every decision you make, because you don't understand consequences. You just think, 'Oh well, we'll do what Mr Setka tells us, and everything will be okay.' No, it won't. Building costs are going to go sky high. We're going to see inflation follow through. We're going to see further pressure on families trying to find housing. It's the same as what you're doing with the CDC. You know that, because you've now put $50 million more into drug and alcohol services. You know that there are going to be consequences for Indigenous families, particularly women and children, but you won't ever acknowledge it. You're just going to crawl back under some rock and pretend you don't know what's happening, because over there you don't understand consequences. It is all talk, no action, unless your union bosses tell you it's okay to do so—absolutely appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do know that you're very big on action if it comes to photo shoots. We do know you're very big on action if it comes to overseas trips. We're all back this week, and we've got people here in the gallery. What they don't understand or potentially may not know is that there absolutely were a number of weeks when we could have come back here to make up for the week that we had off with the Queen's passing. But, no, the new Albanese government, who claimed they were going to be family friendly and all about family-work-life balance, decided with very short notice that they were going to put the first sitting week on the first week of school holidays. They also made the public holiday last Thursday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, why was it last Thursday? Lots of people wonder. What a lot of people don't know is that in Victoria Friday was already a public holiday for the AFL, and today there's a public holiday in WA. So Thursday kind of worked because Mr Albanese was back from overseas; it didn't upset the Victorians, because they didn't lose a public holiday; and it didn't upset the Western Australians, because they didn't lose a public holiday. It upset a lot of businesses. It also upset a lot of families. In my case, I have a daughter who all of a sudden had to come home a day earlier from boarding school. There were parents who had to find something to do with their kids on the Thursday to then send them back on the Friday for the last day of school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you don't know is that Mr Albanese, who's so big on transparency and getting through all this legislation, is not even here for the next two days. So why has he picked this week to come back when we actually have another four weeks that we could have used to come back? There are so few sitting days that they have allocated. The Labor Party has allocated so few sitting days and pulled all the dates back because they cannot face the scrutiny. They will not answer questions when they're put on notice and they do not like transparency. They will keep us out of parliament as often as they can because they do not want to answer the questions. That is so obvious in this place, with only four ministers in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly your ministers in the other chamber are not providing substantial briefs, because all we ever hear is 'not my job' or 'I'm not the minister for'—that never washed when we were sitting on that side of the house. I can tell you, I remember watching a number of my colleagues sitting here coming in with their folders—hilariously, you could barely see them. Thank goodness we had COVID, because the seats next to them were empty for the 19 folders that they had, which, in the case of Senator Cash, required about six staff to carry them because they probably weighed about four times as much as she does! That was because we had staff who had effectively briefed her. They had provided information so that, when those opposite were sitting on this side of the house and questions were asked, we could answer them. The ministers were briefed. Even if it wasn't their direct portfolio responsibility they had done the work. They had been briefed and they understood that, under this system of government, they have responsibilities for the ministers who sit in the other place. They could answer the question. When representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham could answer the questions he was asked, because he had been briefed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we hear in this place when we ask questions of the Prime Minister—I don't even know what we hear. Perhaps someone can tell me what some of those words were today—I'm not 100 per cent sure. There are no answers. There's a killing of time and an inordinate amount of waffle and then you kind of get a bit of a mumble. There was absolutely nothing that would make sense to anyone who would be listening at home. They weren't sentences that would have passed the most basic of English exams. Yet this somehow passes for an answer from a minister in the Senate from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government comes in here and talks to us about how it is this fantastic government and that in 120 days it has done so much and achieved so much. You talked about your job summit. What job summit? You've talked about a job summit. You came into government with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. It wasn't a job summit where you needed to find work for people. You need to find the labour people. When you make people unsafe in workplaces, when you put the unions back in charge—and unions represent 10 per cent of the workforce but are given 33 per cent of the seats—and when you've got over 50 per cent of Australians employed by small business yet you give small business one seat at the table, how do you think you're going to actually attract the labour? You're not. All you are doing is working to detract labour. You are working to do everything you can to deter people from wanting to go and work in these industries because they will be bullied, they will be harassed, they will be intimidated, and the CFMMEU will look at that and go: 'That's alright, it is all par for the course. We will pay for it. It is all good. We still get what we want, and our blokes are in there now, who we give millions of dollars to, and they will just continue to deliver what we want.' You lot on the other side are all 'do as I say and not as I do' and, very soon, the Australian people will start see through it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Trade and Tourism (Senator Farrell) and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Watt) to questions without notice asked by Senators Liddle, Paterson and Henderson today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to a question from Senator Liddle, Senator Farrell said some of the most disgraceful things I have ever heard in this chamber and he did so with a little smirk on his face, as if it were somehow funny what he was saying. Senator Farrell said that the repeal of the cashless debit card was an election commitment; therefore, they had carte blanche to implement it. What he didn't say either publicly in the policy document or subsequently in this chamber was the following: he didn't say that there was no policy associated with this, that there was no detailed consideration of the impact on Australia's most vulnerable. It was simply an ideological left-wing policy statement, one that has unbelievably serious consequences for some of our most vulnerable Australians, particularly women, children and the elderly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who takes time to visit these regions will see what the consequences will be on at-risk communities—women, the elderly and children. It is not at all necessarily about the person who has the card; it is about the behaviours that will impact, again, on women, children and the elderly, and on those who are also subject to humbugging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the view of those of us on this side of the chamber that this card should be extended and not repealed. While minister said they had consulted, it was clear they had not. Ever since, she and her department have been scrambling to try and do some very inadequate consultations and get input from those on the ground. This parliament—the Senate—as I have said previously in this place, very shamefully put through a parliamentary consultation that didn't go to many communities, didn't give time for consultations and did not visit our home state of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's hear what West Australians in the communities who requested this card have said. Ian Trust, the Director of the Wunan Foundation in Kununurra said the card reduced the alcohol, violence and harassment of the elderly and vulnerable for cash when they go to use the ATM. He said, 'The cashless card is not a silver bullet but it is something and we can build on it. But there is no plan by those opposite for what happens after the CDC is abolished. We are left in a vacuum.' The government says if we want to go down the path of keeping income management, it has to be a community decision, but there is no information for the communities about how they want us to arrive at that decision or what the replacement will be. Shame on them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the second location in my own home state of Western Australia, the mayor of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder has said it seems that the cart has been put before the horse by Labor. He said, 'the decision to abolish the CDC has been made without any consultation with the community and the City remains unconsulted' on the transition, which will impact on CDC participants, social service providers, government agencies and the community, and I will also say public health providers, who have to pick up the mess of women and children who are assaulted, raped and murdered by men in their own communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After we pointed all of this out, the committee from this parliament did a very, very short inquiry. And what did the government do? The minister put it out for three days of consultation with the impacted local communities. So, as late as 30 August, the hastily-put-together so-called CDC engagement team sent the Goldfields a raft of draft engagement documents—four documents—and local council had three working days to deal with one of the biggest and most serious issues in their communities. They were sent a draft engagement plan, an engagement summary, a participant checklist and a CDC fact sheet. Well, what a triumph of bureaucracy over genuine consultation with impacted communities! The shires were given until 12 noon on 2 September—three working days later—to provide feedback. This is a disgrace, and those opposite know what the consequences will be in local communities—you cannot say you were not warned—that people will die. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the debate on this motion to take note of answers. Like your good self, Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, I know there are a lot of people in this building who talk a lot about closing the gap and working in Indigenous communities, but I know from the heart that there are a number of us who actually walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Mr Acting Deputy President, you're one of them, and I'm one of them. For those out there who don't know, you and I are both co-patrons of the Men's Shed in Fitzroy Crossing, and I know the work that you have been doing with communities around this issue. It's a very complex issue and it can tear families apart and tear friends apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It hurts my heart to have this debate, because it's a well-known fact in this building that I supported Ian Trust, Lawford Benning and Teddy Carlton in Kununurra when they worked to do the trial in Kununurra and Wyndham. I remember, with previous minister Jenny Macklin, committing to the trial. There was an air of hope that this would go a long way to, as you and I both know, trying our best to—and let's say it as it is—stop rivers of grog that were flowing through the Kimberley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I'll make this very clear: I only speak about the East Kimberley. I am not here to represent Kalgoorlie-Boulder's view, as I have not worked out there. I did a Senate inquiry there early in the piece, before the card came. But I am talking about the work that you and I have done, Mr Acting Deputy President, through the East Kimberley and through the Central Kimberley and the West Kimberley, where they do not have the card. Unfortunately at the time there was great support for the card; there really was. And it breaks my heart, because of the work that I still do in the Kimberley. And nobody, not even Senator Thorpe, who's not here today, who likes to have a cheap crack at us white privileged men—what would we know and what do we do?—well, you and I, we've got the runs on the board. To this day I still do my community work through the Kimberley. I still run the donated furniture and bedding for the victims of domestic violence and the homeless. I'm doing a run again next week, with donated gear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It breaks my heart when I see kids the same age as my grandkids and I know there's no way they're getting fed three meals a day. It breaks my heart when I'm driving through Fitzroy Crossing and I see the kids. I've seen the footage of the kids trying to break into the Coles Express to get the bowser off so they can get petrol to sniff. I know the argument that I had to have, with great support from Coles Express—they were tremendous; Viva Energy weren't very good at all. But fortunately now, both there and at Ngiyali Roadhouse, the 97 per cent fuel is gone, so we've lost the sniffable fuel. Thank goodness for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it tears me apart to think, 'How the heck can we make these kids' lives better?' I see kids going through Fitzroy Crossing, walking from Bayulu—you know where that is, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan; you've been there, like me. They are walking 14 kilometres in the middle of the night because they want to escape the violence and the nonsense that's going on in some of these drug fuelled communities—not all of them, but the ones where the parents aren't doing the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am a member of the Australian Labor Party; I don't apologise for that. I wish we could have some system that would go to taking away the pain that I feel and that you and others would feel every time they go up there. There's a lot of work to be done. But the truth of the matter is that the Labor Party took it to the election. And I will be voting with the Labor Party, with my party, on the abolition of the cashless debit card. I do have to say that Ian Trust—Senator Reynolds mentioned his name—is a personal friend of mine. I still work very closely with Ian—I was on the phone to him last week—and through Wunan and I admire the work he's done. I had a conversation with Ian just prior to Minister Rishworth going up there. I heard Senator Reynolds say 'not a lot of consultation'. Well, I know Minister Rishworth was in Kununurra because I know she met with Ian. She met up with the crew. She met up with everyone. Ian is one of the most wonderful people in the world, and I know that his people and his kids come first and foremost. I know he has some plans, so hopefully we can get together and we can try to mirror what's being done up in Cape York. But the truth of the matter is that it was taken to the election. The other side can bang on about it as much as they like because it wasn't a secret.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've done my best within the Labor Party to put my views forward, and my view's in the minority. So Ian, I'll continue to work with you, mate—and Lawford!—and I hope to heck that we do all we possibly can to achieve closing these gaps. We've been talking about it for damn well long enough, and we're nowhere near it. On that, I will be supporting the bill that the government puts into the Senate and voting for the abolition of the cashless welfare card.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="269375" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANTIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  One of the things that is constantly on the minds of South Australians and Australians that I speak to as I get around is this issue of data integrity and data security. It is consistently a theme—a theme which is bothering people, a theme which is constantly on people's minds—and it's never been more important in our lives than it is today in 2022. Everybody has data out there on the cloud with their service providers, including government departments. It is a massive, massive issue for Australians. It's not an issue to be taken lightly, which I fear is something that we've seen from the government in the last week. It is extraordinary news that the data of something in the order of, we think, as many as 10 million Australians, 10 million Optus users, has been compromised. It's incredibly concerning stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But even more incredibly concerning is the listless approach of the government and the minister responsible, who we heard this afternoon took something in the order of three days to even respond to the incident itself. And to be even more frank about it, having taken three days to respond, the response formed three tweets at three-quarter time of the AFL grand final—it was three, three, three. Extraordinary stuff! It was a relatively dull game, I get that, and if ever you were going to take the opportunity to get a press release out, it would be once you put down the Bollinger at the half-time show at the AFL grand final. The minister banged out a couple of tweets to make sure the Australian people had full confidence in what she was doing in her portfolio. But, of course, that doesn't satisfy  the likes of me; it won't satisfy the likes of Australians who are hoping and pleading that their government is across this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the Leader of the Opposition on Friday—well before the grand final—that this may in fact be the largest-ever data breach in Australian commercial history. That was known well in advance of Saturday. I asked what the delay was in responding and why it took so long. The opposition are now seeking briefings in relation to the matter, but the Albanese government has seemingly just been missing in action on this issue. Australians deserve the opportunity to hear what steps the government is taking to secure their personal data and protect them from future cyberattacks because, of course, this one incident might well be the tip of the iceberg. We don't know what else is out there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australians live their lives now in the cyberworld, and that is only going to increase; this issue is only going to get more important. Of course, with the prospect of digital ID and the digital ID legislation approaching, Australians have every right to be concerned about their data being in the hands of others—governments, private businesses—because we can see what can happen. Millions and millions of terabytes of data can go—well maybe not that much, but terabytes of data—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator ANTIC:</span>
                  </a>  It's a lot. I'm quite tech savvy, as you know! But terabytes of data can go off into the ether without even blinking, as it has in this instant. Businesses and corporations need to be transparent, but governments are meant to be there for the regulatory purposes of taking it up to businesses when they have these sorts of problems. The government, including the Minister for Cyber Security, now needs to make good that delay, that listless response, and make it clear to the Australian people what steps it has taken to protect Australians from future such attacks, because there will be more. We have bad actors in the corporate world. We've got state based actors looking for opportunities to penetrate the cybersecurity veil.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government, as it was, had an extraordinary track record when it came to cybersecurity—in fact, it had some of the most impressive and far-reaching deliveries in terms of key reforms. There were world-leading laws to protect critical infrastructure like water, power and telecommunications from sophisticated cyberattacks. We introduced a suite of ransomware related legislation, which included tougher penalties for criminal provisions to deter cybercriminals. There were regulatory amendments to empower the telco sector to identify and block SMS scams, which are now becoming even more prevalent. We expanded a 24-hour cybersecurity centre hotline to ensure that Australians, including business owners, had access to cybersecurity data. The point I make is that time is of the essence with these matters—not three-quarter time, not full-time, but time.</span>

And I appreciate that Senator Antic appreciated the pun that I used there, but this is a very serious matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The records of 10 million people have been affected in this breach. This is a breach that Optus seriously needs to pay particular attention to and address with the utmost urgency. That is why the Minister for Cyber Security today—and what we have heard from the opposition, apparently—the minister has not made any public statements or tweets. That's how they used to govern. Remember how they used to govern when they were in government? There were press releases and tweets—all spin and no substance. We don't need to do that. As the minister articulated very clearly today in question time, the adults are in charge. We don't need to be putting useless tweets or media releases out to the public. We are taking the advice of our experts—experts who actually understand all the technical ins-and-outs of what has occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are obviously national security implications here—things we can't disclose—but the minister will make all the necessary commentary at the appropriate time, when she has all the facts in front of her. That is something that we and our agencies are trying to do right at this moment. We are working with Optus to try and understand how deep the hacks have gone. The minister, today in question time, made it very clear:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Responsibility for this security breach rests with Optus, and I note that the breach is of a nature that we should not expect to see in a large telecommunications provider in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Antic and others on the other side come in here and pretend that this is an event that requires just a media release or tweet to solve all the issues of the world. It doesn't. Our public servants, particularly those in ASD—the Signals Directorate, the cybersecurity team here in Canberra—and the Federal Police, have been working around the clock over the last four days. Senator Antic makes fun of people, particularly those who may have been at the footy. I can tell you that there are a lot of public servants in this great capital who were working very hard and very closely with Optus to make sure that the people who have hacked into the Optus database are held accountable according to Australian law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the other aspect that the minister highlighted in parliament today is that one in four of our Commonwealth entities met the Essential Eight cybersecurity obligations back in 2021. Further, it is also now on the public record that, when the Labor Party were in opposition last year, it took the Liberal government 365 days to release a discussion paper calling for a ransomware strategy. They then introduced this bill, but it was too late. It was far too late to actually have the bill passed by the previous parliament, because we had the upcoming federal election. There would have been other remedies in that bill that would have prevented such hacks from occurring, but the government of the day, the then coalition government, the Liberals and the Nationals, took their time in implementing the reforms that were needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, Clare O'Neil, has today also indicated that this breach has actually resulted in a need for substantial reform. It is substantial reform that this government will be working on very closely with the industry and others to ensure that this occurrence does not happen again. But Optus has said that it will directly communicate with those customers over coming days, so I do encourage anyone who is a current customer of Optus or has been in the last seven years to, please, make sure you do contact Optus. Please, make sure that they are actually taking this breach very seriously, because the last thing that this government wants is people's details being shopped around out there. We all know of people in our families who have, unfortunately, been caught up in some scams in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is something that this government is taking very seriously, despite the rhetoric that we hear from those opposite. It's interesting, because they've spent the last hour and a half wasting precious Senate time so they could filibuster and prevent important legislation from being passed.</span>

                  <a href="300644" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LIDDLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I came into this place on 1 July, so speaking on this is new to me, but, certainly, the cashless debit card, the BasicsCard and working in and with Aboriginal communities in remote and regional areas are definitely not. Mine is a career spanning some 25, almost 30, years, let alone being born in a place where the card actually exists and having immediate family still living in those places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing that the government misled the Australian public with promises during the election campaign and now, embarrassingly, has to admit that it was a grab for votes. This is a promise they should break. The amendments we have now seen allow Cape York, the CDC trials and those people in the NT who have voluntarily transitioned from the BasicsCard onto the CDC to remain on the cashless debit card. This is just an admission that they have messed up this ill-conceived election commitment. The amendments put forward by the government confirm that even they admit that abolishing the cashless debit card will have serious consequences for vulnerable communities. We see that in the provision of $50 million for additional drug and alcohol support services, because they themselves recognise the serious harm that is likely to result from the removal of this critical program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's decision to abolish the cashless debit card will give the green light to more alcohol, drug abuse and violence in some of our most vulnerable communities, for the most vulnerable people within those communities. Addicts will now have more cash to access grog, ganja, crack and gambling, and families will have less chance to protect themselves because they will no longer have the card to be able to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you an example of how this works. These women—these grandmothers who are looking after their children's children because their children can't or won't—see family walking down the street. With the cashless debit card and the BasicsCard, they don't have to cross the street when they see family walking down the street. What they can say to their family is: 'I'm sorry, I can't give you cash to go and buy grog and ganja and to gamble, because the card doesn't allow me to give you any more cash than the cash I have in my pocket.' That's about protecting their interests. That's about protecting the interests of their children. That's about protecting the interests of their grandchildren. That's about protecting the interests of other people who are not Indigenous but who also live in the towns and communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a race issue; this is actually about people who are problem drinkers and who often find themselves incarcerated and at risk of death in custody because they have been drunk or drugged or who just find themselves on the street because their families will not let them live in their house because of the dysfunction that addiction brings. This is the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CDC is an advanced technology that enables recipients to access their welfare payments using a universal banking platform. The BasicsCard is a limited delivery mechanism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard people way back before 2016, and even when the card came in, say to me, 'I don't like being on the card, but you know what? It gives me protection from my family members. I've got money to feed the kids. I've got money to clothe them. It makes life a whole less hectic.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a few weeks ago, when I went to Ceduna—I'll tell you what my consultation looks like. I actually had to go at the last minute. Sure, we visited those organisations that usually provide the services. But then Julian Leeser and I went for a walk down the street. We went into the gaming room. We went into the bar. We met people on the street in places on the edge of the town, because they were too frightened to speak to us directly. What they said to us repeatedly was, 'I don't like the card. I shouldn't be on the card. But I know the card is really important for my family. I get power and I get control when I can tell people that I can't give them money because the money is quarantined on a card.' That takes it out of the personal. That gives them the power. That gives them the power to feed their children and to clothe them. This is a terrible decision.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice I asked today relating to paid parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-one years ago, in 2001, I sat at the back of this chamber as a staffer, near the senator who introduced Australia's first private member's paid parental leave bill, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja. At that time Australian women were, alongside the US, the only women in the OECD not to get a paid rest when they had a baby—100 years after the International Labour Organization said they should. Anyone who has carried, pushed out, fed a new baby and been sleep deprived for months knows how essential that rest is. If Australian men had babies we would probably lead the world on paid parental leave, just as we led the world on the eight-hour day in 1856 and set a decent minimum wage at Federation. We were international leaders in creating a working man's paradise—a white working man's paradise, it's important to note—but that paradise did not extend to mothers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it was not until 10 years after that first private member's bill that this parliament finally enacted paid parental leave, in 2010, with leave of 18 weeks at the minimum wage. An additional two weeks was added later for partners on a use-it-or-lose-it basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eleven years on, we have been overtaken by the rest of the OECD yet again, with the average period of paid parental leave now around 52 weeks in the OECD, and close to full replacement wages in many places. Australia now has one of the poorest paid-parental-leave schemes in the OECD. We are now stuck at an inadequate 18 weeks paid leave, with two weeks for partners, at minimum wage, without superannuation—a pay cut for so many people at a critical moment in a family's life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Greens are pushing for a catch-up. We've given notice of a bill, to be introduced in November, to increase the length of paid parental leave to 26 weeks, to offer six weeks of paid parental leave to be available to second carers on a use-it-or-lose-it basis. That leave is to be paid at a minimum wage level as the lowest level of payment, with income replacement for those who earn more up to a wage cap of $100,000, and superannuation to be paid on the full period of leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overseas evidence tells us that increasing the rate of pay for paid parental leave and making a portion of it available for six weeks, in our bill, to second carers—mostly fathers in many Australian households—on a use-it-or-lose-it basis has a powerful, positive effect on the longer term sharing of parenting. It's great for fathers. It's really important for kids. It's important for families. It will shift gender equity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also vital to include super. At present, new parents pay a big price in lost income, including superannuation, when they have a baby. We must ensure that mothers in particular do not find themselves living in poverty in old age after a lifetime of work and care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's powerful evidence that improving paid parental leave like this will do many good things. It will increase women's participation in paid work, it will address skills shortages, it will increase GDP, it will improve children's development and it will improve relationships between couples, and between kids and their parents. It has a very positive effect on men's health and it will help address gender inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those supporting increased paid parental leave—and they are many—know we can afford it. We can afford to increase the length of leave and the rate of payment, and we can pay superannuation on it. Rather than give a $9,000 tax cut to the very wealthy and each of the 227 politicians in this building, we can redirect stage 3 tax cuts to the parents and kids who need it most. We should set aside the stage 3 tax cuts and instead improve paid parental leave and take other measures that will help Australian families deal with the cost-of-living crisis, including providing free, quality, accessible early childhood education and care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent Jobs and Skills Summit, Australians and organisations from across the country and parents, women, unions and employers were united in a call for a paid parental leave increase and improvement for Australian parents, especially mothers. Indeed, the ACTU called for a pathway to 52 weeks leave, moving ourselves more centrally to the OECD average. Alongside improved early childhood education and care, increasing paid parental leave was one of the most common and most united points of discussion at the summit. No-one opposed it. It's time to act. We can afford it, and for the sake of our kids, parents, women, workplaces and economy, it's time we did it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The need for a nationwide rent freeze, given the biggest annual rent increases in fourteen years and rents growing seven times faster than wages in our capital cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing short of a full-blown rental crisis happening right now in Australia. In my home state of Tasmania, since 2016, the median rental rate in Hobart, where I live, has grown by 50 per cent. That is 50 per cent in six years. It is absolutely critical that we address this crisis in rental affordability, and in housing more broadly—if you are lucky enough to be able to rent a place, when so many people cannot afford to pay their rent and so many cannot even find a place to rent because vacancy rates are too low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The explosion in rental costs and the ensuing rental crisis represents a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich and, in general terms, from the young to the older. It is not by accident and not just the bad luck of the tenants; this has been done and driven deliberately by successive Liberal and Labor governments. The class war by property owners and the banks has been going on for a long time, and, make no mistake, the tenants are losing the war. The Labor Party and the Liberal Party have backed in landlords and they have backed in the banks. They have backed them in to continue to make massive profits and they have done that by ensuring that the return for the banks and the return for the landlords is guaranteed by the taxpayer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great Australian dream is no longer that you can one day own a home of your own. The great Australian dream today is owning a property portfolio, with tenants who pay your income and who pay, ultimately, for your assets. So if you own a house and it is rented out, even though you may be renting it out for a loss, that loss is subsidised through tax breaks for you, paid for by the taxpayers. What that means, tragically, is that not only do tenants pay off their landlords' mortgages; they pay the tax that their landlords don't. On what planet is that fair or reasonable? It is an absolute scam, and the scammers are the political parties in this place that deliver on those tax breaks. In real terms, what that means for people on the ground is that they are skipping meals, they are not paying power bills and they are not paying for much-needed medicine, just to keep a roof over their heads. In a country where a landlord can own 283 rental properties and still complain about the prospect of a freeze in rents, this is an obscenity. Enough is enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to cap rents. We should do it for two years and then peg them to the CPI thereafter. That is just the start. We should scrap the capital gains tax discount, we should end negative gearing and we should actually start building enough homes so that everyone can have a home to live in. Most importantly, we need to shatter the class gap between those who own housing and those who don't.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator McKim. The Albanese government recognises the challenges that Australians are facing, because we talk to them every day. So we know families are struggling, after a decade of low wages growth, with cost-of-living pressures and rental affordability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The private rental market has been put under significant pressure as a result of strong numbers of people moving within states, between towns and cities, and across state lines, putting pressure on particular rental markets. Also putting pressure on rental markets have been shrinking household sizes which, in turn, put pressure on the supply of private rentals. Major cities and regional towns are experiencing low vacancy rates and really fast-growing rental prices. This is forcing Australians into insecure housing arrangements like caravan parks and other temporary solutions. In a wealthy country like Australia, this is just not acceptable. We do understand how tough it is for Australian households. We know that long waiting lists for social housing are forcing vulnerable Australians into the private rental market. And we know that more Australians are being forced to rent because they've been unable to buy their own home, which is why our ambitious housing reform agenda is working to address the underlying causes of housing unaffordability, using the levers that we have available to us as a federal government to get more Australians into affordable homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But these challenges that we face today have of course not come on overnight. They've been very real challenges for the past 10 years—challenges that the former government took absolutely no interest in addressing. Those opposite oversaw shamefully low numbers of new social housing builds when they were in government. By 2020, seven years into their term, they had built only 7,500 new dwellings. Compare that with the more than 30,000 new dwellings from the previous Labor government over a similar period of time. But in their dying days the coalition finally had a lightbulb moment on housing policy and finally came up with one that they said would address housing affordability and help people own their home. And what was that solution? We of course will all remember that it was to force Australians to raid their own superannuation to be able to afford a house deposit—a policy that would have driven property prices up even further and left Australians with higher debt and depleted workers retirement savings. Why does the coalition hate superannuation? Why do they hate it so much? It was a policy that would have left even more Australians without financial security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, the Albanese government have a comprehensive plan to address prices and we are wasting no time getting on with it. We're establishing the Housing Australia Future Fund, investing $10 billion to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties. That of course is going to get more people who need them into those homes and it's also going to put downward pressure on rental prices and help really vulnerable families to access housing when they're fleeing family and domestic violence. In addition to that massive investment—an unprecedented $10 billion of federal investment in social and affordable housing—we're unlocking up to half a billion dollars through the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to invest in even more social and affordable housing. That is a move that will encourage investors, such as super funds, to invest in projects that drive down housing prices, rather than gutting workers' retirement savings and driving house prices up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where we think the super funds can come into the housing equation, in partnering with government to invest in projects that create more homes and drive down prices. Again, we think that's a better option than forcing people to raid their own super in a desperate attempt to afford their own home while of course gutting their retirement savings and putting themselves in an even more vulnerable position in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also helping Australians to enter the housing market and own their own home. We've brought forward the start of the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee to 1 October. That will help up to 10,000 Australians to purchase their first home. This joins the up to 50,000 Australians who are being assisted to buy their first home under the Home Guarantee Scheme. Our government is also introducing the Help to Buy program. That is going to help cut the cost of buying a home by up to 40 per cent, making it easier and cheaper for Australians to own their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to rental affordability, our government is stepping up and bringing the states and the territories together, because that's what we do. We work with the state governments and the territory governments. We bring them together with us to solve the big challenges that Australians face. So we're working with the state and territory housing ministers to explore innovative solutions to address these housing challenges. We're developing a new national housing and homeless plan that will form a key part of our agenda and we're introducing a national housing supply and affordability council to ensure the Commonwealth is playing its role in increasing supply and improving affordability. Our government is stepping up to bring new national leadership on housing—national leadership that was sorely missing under the previous government—because while we recognise that some of the levers to fix these problems sit with state and territory governments we also recognise that the previous government simply was missing in action on this question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know the security that housing can bring to Australian workers and we also know that one of the key barriers to accessing housing is insecure work. The crisis of insecure work is a legacy of those opposite—one that they absolutely refused to admit to in their 10 years in government, one that they refuse to admit even exists. Coalition senators have said, 'Insecure work is a Labor lie—it's a Labor lie.' One of their ministers earlier this year called job insecurity 'made-up issues'. So it was Labor lies and made-up issues—despite the evidence right in front of them, including evidence about the links between insecure work and housing insecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was despite what they themselves were hearing from workers. These were workers who came and told their stories to, for example, the job security inquiry, led by my colleague Tony Sheldon: stories of low pay; stories of low, irregular hours; stories of having no ability to provide stable income on a rental application. These were people who were working and having to live in caravan parks because they couldn't get enough secure hours to actually fill out a successful rental application. So fixing the very real crisis of insecure work is part of our government's plan to give people security at work and also in housing. The legacy that those opposite left behind is a crisis of insecure work, a decade of low wages growth and nothing—nothing at all—to help Australians afford a home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the importance of good, secure jobs. We know they're a gateway to good, secure lives. We know that they're a gateway to good, secure housing as well. And we know what insecure work is doing to households and families. That's why we have a secure jobs plan, which is about giving workers the permanency and security that they need to plan for their future. We'll make secure work an objective of the Fair Work Act, making sure that the Fair Work Commission puts job security at the heart of its decision-making, and we're introducing a secure jobs code to ensure that taxpayer money spent through government contracts is being used to support secure employment too, because we know people need secure jobs and secure houses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government takes these housing challenges very seriously. We're getting on with delivering answers to them. We know that having a good job is critical to good housing. We know we can't require the state and territory governments to freeze rents, as the Greens want us to. We know we can't force Australians to raid their retirement savings, as those opposite want us to as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  In speaking on this urgency motion, I'd first like to address some of the comments made by Senator Walsh, whose thoughts and views I deeply respect. But there are three points I'd like to make with respect to Senator Walsh's contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, in relation to the policy that the coalition went to the last election with, the policy was to give superannuation fund holders, especially the young, a choice. It wasn't a question of forcing; it was a question of giving them the choice, if they decided to do so, to take a certain amount out of their superannuation fund in order to get them into the housing market and buy their first home, the most important asset for the rest of their life. That's the first point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, I believe that, in relation to the supply of housing, we need to be more creative, in terms of working with community organisations, being innovative—social housing doesn't necessarily have to be owned by state governments, federal governments or whichever government—and working with community organisations at the front line to try to get solutions for local communities. Some of the most passionate people in this space, as I'm sure everyone would agree, are those frontline community organisations that are dealing with this issue every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point I'd like to make in relation to Senator Walsh's comments is on the question of supply—supply, supply, supply. We need more supply for people who are seeking to rent accommodation. That's the question. We need supply. Green tape and red tape are frustrating supply. I see it where my office is located, in Springfield, the south-west growth corridor of Queensland, the fastest growing region in Queensland, where the people who want to construct housing for new home buyers, for others, for renters et cetera are being frustrated by the green tape and the red tape. We need supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding Senator McKim's urgency motion, whenever the Greens put forward a motion dealing with economics, I always go to my library and bring out my book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Basic Economics</span> by Dr Thomas Sowell. I see what my book on basic economics says, because that always provides the answers. I only needed to go to page 45 of my book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ba</span><span style="font-style:italic;">sic </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Economics</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>by Thomas Sowell, to learn that the history of economics teaches us that rent controls do not work.

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of incentives, it is likewise easy to understand what happened in England when rent control was extended in 1975 to cover furnished rental units. According to <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:none underline;">The Times</span> of London:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Advertisements for furnished rented accommodation in the London <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:none underline;">Evening Standard</span> plummeted dramatically in the first week after the Act came into force and are now running at about 75 per cent below last year's levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what happened in London in 1975. Let's go to Toronto. Let's go to another continent. We've been to Australia; we've been to Africa; we've been to Europe. Let's go to North America. This is what happened in Toronto:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Within three years after rent control was imposed in Toronto in 1976, 23 percent of all rental units in owner-occupied dwellings were withdrawn from the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what happened in North America. You don't have to have a PhD in economics like Dr Thomas Sowell to work out that rent control does not work. It has never worked. In fact, it actually hurts the people it's intended to help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then what happens to these places? What happens in these places when they actually remove rent control? Let's take the corollary. What happens when you remove rent control and you let the market act and let people make their individual decisions? Again, I quote from page 47:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In Massachusetts, a statewide ban on local rent control laws in 1994 led to the construction of new apartment buildings in some formerly rent-controlled Massachusetts cities for the first time in 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You ended rent control, and actually got new apartment buildings for the most vulnerable in society for the first time in 25 years when you removed rent control. That's basic economics. We need more of that—more basic economics. This stuff isn't new. You don't have to be John Maynard Keynes or Milton Friedman to get it. It's not new; it's all there. I'm happy to lend my copy to anyone in the Greens at any time; just come around to my office. I'll even buy you one! I quote it so often to you, Senator McKim. I'll buy you one! I'll get 12 of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, I must say, it's a bit difficult to sit here and be lectured to by those opposite sitting in the Labor Party coming from my home state of Queensland. I see what the Queensland government is doing; they're drinking the same Kool Aid as the Greens in terms of this urgency resolution. They have this ridiculous proposal at the moment with respect to land tax. They want the land tax threshold for Queensland investors to take into account properties which are held in other states. That's absolutely crazy stuff. And what's the consequence? What happens when you change the tax system in this way? What happens when you introduce rent control? The investors leave. The landlords say: 'It's too hard. If it's not going to be profitable for me, I'll go and invest my money somewhere else.' That's what happens. It's basic economics. That's what we're seeing in Queensland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not waiting around; they're selling up. What do they say?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"We have three rental properties in Queensland; we've already sold one, and we're in the process of selling another," Mr Meek said. "We're planning to move into the last property as we're unable to find a decent rental, so that's three rentals off the market already."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the problem. That's what basic economics tells you. That's what the experience from all over the world tells you: when you introduce things like rental freezes, massive changes to land tax and laws which make it more difficult for landlords to be flexible with respect to their investments, they walk away. Then the supply of rental properties decreases and rents go up. And who's hurt? The most vulnerable in our society.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  Speaking with people in our communities at the moment or even picking up a newspaper, you would have to have your head buried deeply in the sand if you fail to recognise that housing affordability is absolutely top of mind for so many. And there is no surprise why—rent has gone through the roof. The dream of owning your first home has become a real nightmare. Across the country, many areas have seen the steepest annual rent increases on record this year. In Sydney, where I live, the annual increase has been a whopping 19.6 per cent. A very grim tale is told in regional New South Wales as well, especially by those who have been so deeply affected by the climate induced floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfolding rental affordability crisis is destroying communities. A recent ABC article tells this story:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Single mother Tilly Eastwood says the worst part of being priced out of the rental market isn't living in a garage with her three children. It isn't the absence of windows for light or fresh air. It's not even the 150-plus failed rental applications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's the gnawing feeling that she's letting down her kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How is it that the Labor government is willing to put $244 billion for stage 3 tax cuts back into the pockets of the wealthiest and the billionaires yet refuse to act for those who are struggling to keep a roof over their head—a very basic human right? We need a national rent freeze and we need it now. With more and more people renting long term, it's beyond clear that people in our community of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life desperately need relief from skyrocketing rents and poor tenancy protections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government cannot just wash their hands of the responsibility of ensuring a home for everyone. They regularly play a role in issues like industrial relations, energy and other issues which would usually be left up to individual states and territories, so surely they can do the same for housing. A two-year rent freeze would be followed by ongoing rent caps, an end to no-grounds evictions, minimum standards for rental properties, and rights for tenants to make minor improvements to their homes as well as to have companion animals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been fighting hard for rental affordability, renters' rights and homes for all. Here are a couple of examples. Jenny Leong, the Greens member for Newtown, has been leading this work in the New South Wales parliament. Earlier this year Jenny introduced a private member's bill to introduce eviction bans and rent gaps in flood impacted areas in New South Wales as well as an end to no-grounds evictions and a limit to rent increases for renters across New South Wales. Further north, the Greens MP for South Brisbane, Amy MacMahon, introduced a bill that would freeze rents for two years. In her second reading speech, Amy said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Across Queensland families are struggling to make ends meet with rising costs of rent, fuel and groceries and it is hitting renters and first home buyers the hardest. … Families are living in tents because they cannot afford a secure, affordable home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an outrageous situation, and it requires decisive action now to finally tackle it. The housing affordability crisis is harming too many people. We need a rent freeze right now. We need strong national renters' rights standards. We need to build a million publicly owned affordable homes. We need to end the tax loopholes for the richest in the country. Nobody should be without a home. Whether you own a home or rent, our housing system should work for people, not for profit. The government must make the choice of fixing this crisis.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  The Albanese government understands just how serious the current housing challenge is. We are committed to acting to address it, whereas the previous government made it very clear that it would not take up the call for action. Unlike some in this place, we know there is no silver bullet to address this very serious problem, but Labor has an ambitious plan to tackle the housing challenge we inherited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went into the May election with a comprehensive housing reform agenda and we're working hard to address the causes of Australia's rental affordability challenges. We recognise that this is a very serious challenge occurring across the country, which is putting stress on a great many families and individuals. In Tasmania, renters are experiencing these increases just like the rest of the country. More and more people have been coming to my electorate office and talking to me about the struggle of trying to find an affordable home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cities and towns across our country are experiencing extremely low rental vacancy rates. Australians are being forced into insecure housing like caravans and tents. This is not an acceptable situation in a wealthy country such as ours, and the Albanese government is taking significant steps to address it. These rental and cost-of-living challenges are very real and they need real, lasting solutions. We are not, however, actively considering proposals to freeze rents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that regulation of residential tenancies is a matter for state and territory governments. The Commonwealth cannot require those governments to freeze rents, but there are things we can do. Our government's housing reform agenda is working to address the causes of Australia's rental affordability challenges. We're moving to swiftly implement a comprehensive plan to address the rental crisis and help those in the private rental market, a plan which was endorsed by the Australian people when they voted us into government this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Social housing lists have grown to an unacceptable size over recent years. In my home state of Tasmania, the government's own data shows that more than 4,450 families are now stuck on the government's historically unprecedented waitlist as the state government has failed to deliver on its big housing promises over many, many years. These long waiting lists for social housing across the country have forced vulnerable Australians into the private rental market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To help address this, we've acted quickly by unlocking up to $575 million through the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to invest in more social and affordable housing. This will support our commitment to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties through the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. This will put downward pressure on rental prices. We have many Australians who are trapped in the rental market because they have been unable to buy their own home. In response to this, the Albanese government has brought forward the start of the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee to 1 October this year, three months earlier than we promised. That initiative alone will help up to 10,000 regional Australians every year to get into their first home with a deposit of as little as five per cent. The government will guarantee up to 15 per cent of the purchase price for eligible first home buyers, meaning that regional Australians who are looking to buy can avoid paying costly mortgage insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is concrete action taken by our government to help Australians into a home. And it's targeted action, available only to locals who have been living in the region that they want to buy in or a neighbouring regional area. To be eligible for a Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee, applicants must be Australian citizens, purchase outside a capital city and demonstrate that they've been living in the region in which they are purchasing the property or the adjacent regional area for at least 12 months. This is in addition to the Home Guarantee Scheme, which helps up to 50,000 eligible Australians into home ownership every year. It supports first home buyers and single parents with dependants into home ownership with a smaller deposit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the First Home Guarantee, up to 15 per cent of an eligible first home buyer's home loan from a participating lender will be guaranteed. This will enable the home buyer to purchase a home with as little as a five per cent deposit and without paying lenders mortgage insurance. The Family Home Guarantee supports single parents with dependants to own their own home with a minimum deposit of as little as two per cent. We will also introduce Help to Buy, a brand-new program that will help cut the cost of buying a home by up to 40 per cent and make it cheaper and easier for eligible Australians to own their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to recognise that many of the levers to fix rental affordability are in the hands of state and territory governments. So, in a spirit of true collaboration and national leadership, our government has begun a process working with state and territory housing ministers to explore innovative approaches to address rental affordability. This reform agenda, so important to ensure that Australians are not denied that basic right of a roof over their heads, will be in clear evidence in the upcoming budget, with real commitments to put more downward pressure on rents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the previous government, we recognise that the Commonwealth has an important leadership role in increasing housing supply and improving affordability. We will establish the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council to ensure that the Commonwealth plays that leadership role in increasing housing supply and improving affordability. The council will be advised by experts from the sector. It will set targets for land supply, in consultation with states and territories. It will also collect and make public data on housing supply, demand and affordability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fixing land supply and planning will improve housing affordability and boost economic growth. But the only way to achieve this will be by having the three levels of government all working together. The Minister for Housing and Homelessness, the Hon. Julie Collins MP, has started the development of a new national housing and homelessness plan that will become a key plank in our reform agenda. This plan will be developed with the support and assistance of key stakeholders, including states and territories, local government, not-for-profits, urban development experts and industry bodies. It will set out the key reforms needed to make it easier for Australians to buy a home and to rent and put a roof over the heads of more homeless Australians. Organisations from all sides of the political spectrum have been calling for a plan like this for years, and the previous government ignored them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government takes rental affordability challenges seriously. We are delivering the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee ahead of schedule, because we recognise the serious housing challenges in regional Australia. We inherited a housing affordability crisis and we are tackling it with a practical but ambitious plan. This challenge is one we will strive to address every day we are in government in this country. We know we have a lot of work ahead of us, and, this coming weekend, the start of the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee is that first step.</span>

While I'm speaking to the issue of freezing rents, I think the best way to get around this issue is to actually own your own house. That is why I'm in the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quote from the speech that's often considered the original speech, or the manifesto—if I could use that word—of the Liberal Party. That statement is a bit of an oxymoron but anyway. It's interesting to note that Robert Menzies in his Forgotten People speech mentions the word 'home' 23 times. He says that the rich and powerful can look after themselves. He also says that we should not go back to the 'old and selfish notions of laissez-faire' capitalism. If they'd actually read the Forgotten People speech a lot of people would be surprised by that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to give anyone on the other side of the chamber that speech, because you would see that it appeals to those people who just want to remain quiet in the suburbs, who don't need other people telling them what to. They just want to be left alone in their house with their family, and everyone else can get out of their lives. I know I speak for many who feel like that, and that's why I'm in the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about what homes mean to the Liberal Party and quote a part of Robert Menzies's speech. Firstly, he describes homes as having a:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… stake in the country. It has responsibility for homes—homes material, homes human, and homes spiritual. I do not believe that the real life of this nation is to be found either in great luxury hotels and the petty gossip of so-called fashionable suburbs …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is not a big fan of the blowhards. I know a lot of people think the Liberal Party are the blowhard party. We do have blowhards and sometimes we tend to take their line but we shouldn't do that. We are the party of battlers and we've got to remember that. This country is all about 'wealth for toil'. It's founded by the battlers, not the blowhards, and we need to remember that. Menzies says:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I have mentioned homes material, homes human and homes spiritual. Let me take them in order. What do I mean by "homes material"?

If you consider it, you will see that if, as in the old saying, "the Englishman's home is his castle", it is this very fact that leads on to the conclusion that he who seeks to violate that law by violating the soil of England must be repelled and defeated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim, I totally think we need to get people in houses. There's a lot to be said for homeownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems we've got with the rental market at the moment is that not enough people own their own homes. I've often ranted against the fact that when Keating made a lot of amendments in the eighties—as you well know, there was a lot of neoliberal stuff that was brought in in the eighties—one of the biggest mistakes that was made was that we didn't have capital gains tax on housing for the wealthy. I'm not against the common man having a house, but you could take, say, five per cent starting at $2½ million or something. There's a level above which you shouldn't have capital-gains-tax-free housing. You've got multimillionaires living in Bondi and the eastern suburbs of Sydney. They buy a house for $3 million, they sell it for $10 million, they clean up $7 million in profit and they don't pay a cent of tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, you've got the battlers out there, who get out of bed every morning and put their nose to the grindstone. They will start paying tax above $18,200 at 19c in the dollar plus two per cent for Medicare. They will also lose 50c in the dollar if they're on Newstart, or JobSeeker or whatever it's called nowadays. Then they lose another 10½ per cent for super. Earning between 20 and 30 grand, you end up losing 80c out of every dollar you earn, and that's completely absurd. I think we should have a capital gains tax on housing—above $2 million or $3 million; somewhere in that range—and use that to give a tax offset to the low-income earners who struggle. Basically, if you earn less than the cost of living, which, let's say is $40,000 a year, you're actually losing money. Why do we tax people below the cost of living? It is complete nonsense. I'm very passionate about homeownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I know that your intention is good, we do have a bit of a problem at the moment because we've also got a very incompetent RBA, which blew up the housing bubble throughout COVID, even though we already had a housing bubble before that. I should note that in 1985 we had $8 billion in foreign debt. When Keating opened up the economy to foreign banks, by 2008 we had $800 billion in foreign debt. All of that money mainly went into the property market in Sydney and Melbourne, which meant that the housing prices went from four times average earnings to 13 times average earnings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to start to learn how to control the volume of capital in this country and not let so much money go into housing. At the same time, we don't put any money into manufacturing and being productive. If we're going to get ahead in this country, we have got to stop relying on other countries. As I say to people: if you got washed up on a desert island would you (a) go to the bank, try and manipulate interest rates and get a Fitch credit rating or (b) look to provide essential services to the people like dams, water, housing and productivity? Of course you'd choose the latter. We know that that's exactly what happened in this country about 210 years ago when Lachlan Macquarie came here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lachlan Macquarie was the first governor to see Australia as a country, not a colony. He realised that in order to run a country properly you've got to have your own currency. We don't really have our own currency today. We do in name, but what people don't realise is that, whenever we go to build a dam or anything like that, we use foreign currency. This, of course, means that when you build a dam for $1 billion and you borrow $1 billion in foreign currency the first $1 billion in wealth you create has to be repaid offshore. What people don't understand is that not all money printing is the same. If I'm a company and I want to become a bigger company, I can issue shares, or equity. It's not called debt; it's called equity. Equity is title. As a sovereign country, we have title over this country. If I want to build a dam, I can issue shares in a dam that is productive. I don't need to borrow for it. All you need to do is get the RBA to lend $1 billion to whichever state government's going to build the dam, and all they have to do is repay that debt. But I digress a little bit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why I talk about the RBA and this whole volume of money in the system is that we need to lower the cost of living as well. We currently have a supply shock because of Russia and all these other things. Supply has gone down. What the RBA is going to do is try to crush demand as well by pushing it down. They're going to use an austerity policy. That is complete and utter madness. What we need is a productivity policy that is going to increase supply. Rather than reduce demand and make people suffer through not being able to rent a house or buy their own house, we need to increase productivity. We need to build.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You will get all the neoliberals and all these people who think they're economists, but let me tell you: economists are to finance what climate modellers are to scientists. They rely on assumptions and false ideas. The idea that building dams is going to cause inflation and is a bad thing is completely ridiculous. If you build more dams, more power stations, more roads and better transport infrastructure, you increase supply. If you increase supply and you push the cost of essential services down, then you make it cheaper for business to actually operate. If you make it cheaper for businesses to operate—guess what!—they employ more people. If you employ more people and you're making more money, you can pay them more, and then they can afford to buy a house. It becomes a virtuous circle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say that, while I can't agree with you entirely on the premise of keeping rental levels entirely flat, we do need to look at the way we run this country, and we need to look at becoming much more productive. We've got to stop all this paper shuffling and pandering to markets and start pandering to genuine productivity. That means fewer academics and more tradesmen. We need to get rid of payroll tax in this country by bringing back stamp duty on share trading. It is completely nuts that, if I buy a house, a farm, a business or a truck, I've got to pay stamp duty but I can flip shares all day on the stock market, which is manipulated by foreign investors, and pay no stamp duty. I'll leave it at that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  Housing is an essential service and a human right. Everyone has a right to safe, accessible and affordable housing. Yet, in the midst of Australia's cost-of-living crisis, millions of Australians are struggling to make ends meet, while also paying increasingly high rental prices. We have seen the biggest annual rent increases in 14 years. The cost of rent is increasing seven times faster than wages. That's insane. It's crushing people. This is a housing crisis, and we know that the implementation of a nationwide rent freeze is essential. It would press pause on rent increases and allow wages time to catch up and would stop the profiteering by landlords from becoming even worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this debate we've heard about strategies for increasing the number of houses in this country, helping people into homeownership, but that is not going to help the family who can't afford their rent this week, and there are hundreds and hundreds of people across our country in that situation. This is a national emergency. That we have parents, carers, families and children sleeping in cars, sleeping in tents, and at risk of being evicted from their housing because their rent has been put up and they can't afford it, is something that every single person in this place should want to move heaven and earth to fix today. That's why we need to freeze rents, and it's why we need to cap increases to two per cent each year thereafter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are currently undergoing one of the most significant transfers of wealth from non-property owners to property owners. It is deepening economic inequality in this country. Our current willingness to accept skyrocketing rental costs is creating a growing generational wealth divide as young people are forced to rent for longer, at higher prices and with lower wages. Tenants are being saddled with the cost of increasing interest rates through these rent increases. A rent freeze is one of the most important things we could do to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures of Australians. Let's get it done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  We are in a housing crisis. Australia is seeing the biggest rent increases in 14 years, putting millions of Australians into severe rental stress. None are more affected than the millions of Australians who are forced by this Labor government to survive under the poverty line on grossly inadequate income support payments. I've heard from so many people who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads. One person who receives the disability support pension contacted my office to let me know that they were evicted from their rental property of nine years because their landlord wanted to double the rent and couldn't do it while they were still in the property. This person is now homeless and staying in a caravan park with no heating. Someone else told me that their rent had gone up by $60 a week. It's now well over half their income. Once they pay the rent and their bills, they have $18 left over for food and all other items. They are forced to buy out-of-date food. They can't afford fresh fruit and vegetables, and their health is suffering because of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Poverty is a political choice, and this government is choosing to leave people without food or heating as they struggle to pay the rent. Just as the government coordinated a national response to the COVID-19 health crisis, the federal government should coordinate an emergency national response to the housing crisis, including an urgent rent freeze. The Greens are also fighting for all government income support payments to be lifted so they are above the poverty line, ensuring everyone has enough to cover their basic needs. Our plan would raise all government income support payments above the poverty line. It would abolish mutual obligations and remove unfair restrictions on who can access payments, ensuring that everyone has enough to cover their basic needs. Don't let the government convince you otherwise: this is possible. I've said it once and I will say it again: poverty is a political choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government now has a choice. Labor can either work with the Greens, not go ahead with the stage 3 tax cuts and fund services to support everybody, or they can choose to side with Peter Dutton and funnel more money into the pockets of billionaires and the ultrawealthy. It is a choice. Poverty is a political choice. We have the choice to end people living in poverty. We have a chance to institute a rent freeze, which will help people survive. Poverty is a political choice, and we call upon this government to make the right choice.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  Housing is a human right. Every single person in our community should be able to have a roof over their head—somewhere to call home, somewhere that is safe, somewhere that is affordable, somewhere where they can belong in a community. And making sure that every single community member is able to have a roof over their head is one of the top priorities of the Australian Greens, and it should be a top priority of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the reality of being a renter in Australia in 2022 is not something that we often hear in parliament because—shock! horror!—there aren't too many renters who are elected members of parliament. But let me just fill you in on what it is actually like to be a renter right now in Australia. One of my friends in Perth rents a house for $500 a week. Inside this house, in the summer, it is 40 degrees. When this person contacted the landlord and said, 'Hey, you've just put my rent up. Could you please fit an air-conditioning system?' the response of the landlord was: 'The amount of money you're paying is commensurate with a house without an air-conditioning system.' No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another friend of mine in the lower south metropolitan part of Perth spent one year arguing with their landlord about whether or not their internet was functioning. They couldn't get online. They couldn't access government services at home. They couldn't socialise with their friends during lockdown. Every time they sent their landlord an email saying that this was a problem, the landlord responded that the telecommunication company had not registered a fault, and round and round it went for a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, whether it is telecommunications, air conditioning, the leaky pipe in the back of the cistern that causes black mould to grow or the holes in the roof, people are struggling in such deep insecurity, such absolute uncertainty, and they are suffering such a profound power imbalance with their landlords that it causes incredible mental health impacts upon them. You literally don't know whether this week is the week the landlord is going to evict you, whether this week is the week that they're going renovate and kick you out or whether this week is the week the landlord will simply put your rent up so high that you cannot afford your home. This government must follow the Greens' lead and institute a rent freeze so that, at the very least, people renting across this country can know what they're going to have to pay and that it will be affordable for them so that they can keep a roof over their head.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  I rise to reject this motion in the strongest terms. Forcing a rent freeze will only make our housing crisis worse, not better. Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware of the huge rent increases that have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm fully aware that many Australian families are struggling with it. But freezing rents will only force more landlords out of the sector and further reduce the amount of accommodation available for rent. You need to address the underlying causes of this crisis—lack of supply, in part driven by the fact we allow foreigners and multinationals to buy new residential property. Actually, stop all foreign ownership of any housing, new or established; massive and costly regulation imposed on landlords; and high demand largely driven by the unsustainable flood of immigrants coming into this country as part of Labor's plan to outsource jobs that should go to Australians. State governments should release more land in a timely manner, address costs and red tape, and revise stamp duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most landlords are not wealthy property tycoons. In many cases it supplements an otherwise meagre income. Many have spent all their lives making sacrifices to invest in a single property to make things a bit more comfortable in their retirement. Their costs are going up too, like council rates, insurance and interest rates. They have no control over these costs. If they cannot raise rents to accommodate these costs, they will leave the rental game and Australians will have an even lower supply than before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Landlords are also tired of increasing regulation which takes away their rights as property owners. These days, when a tenant moves in they effectively become the owners, and if they become a problem they can be impossible to remove in exchange for responsible tenants. Bonds worth four or six weeks rent are wholly inadequate to cover the cost of repairing property damage, wear and tear. Landlords in some cases can't even refuse tenants who own pets they don't want in their properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Greens want to take away another right. Are they completely ignorant of the short-term holiday accommodation market? Are they not aware of how much easier it is for property owners in this market than the rental market? Insurance costs are taken care of. Most stays are only for a day or a week, limiting the amount of wear and tear a landlord might need to fix. Property owners can make a lot more money from this market. A home that might attract $25,000 a year in rent can earn double that figure in the short-term holiday accommodation market without much of the regulatory burden forced on landlords.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Greens mean well with this idea; I really do. I look forward to you freezing rents on your own investment properties, but don't impose your economic illiteracy on Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of document 10 on page 4 relating to the Australian Research Council funding schemes. Senators will know that I have a strong interest in the work of the ARC. The importance of research and the ARC cannot be understated. It was a travesty how university research and researchers were treated by the previous government, in particular how ministers made something of a sport of vetoing recommended grants based on a whim or a political ideology and then tried to make a mockery of some of the proposals they shut down after they had been approved through the rigorous peer review process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shamefully, in December last year, the then acting education minister delivered a letter of expectations to the then CEO of the ARC, telling the ARC to direct more funding towards national manufacturing priorities at the expense of other research and demanding greater prioritisation of the national interest test in determining funding recommendations. The letter was widely condemned by academic institutions as unjustified interference. The CEO resigned less than a week later. The new Labor education minister has announced that there will be an independent review of the ARC as recommended by the Senate committee inquiry into my bill to remove ministerial discretion from research grants administered by the ARC. This is welcome. The new minister also said that there should be an end to delays and political interference in the research grant process. That, too, is welcome. However, the minister also said that the national interest test should continue. There is no compelling reason for the continuation of the national interest test. It is onerous, it is unnecessary and it is causing havoc for researchers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A practice known to the academics as NIT-picking has delayed and interfered with the research funding process in recent research months. This document produced in response to my OPD earlier this month shows the concerning extent of the ARC CEO's interference and just how broken and unnecessary the NIT is. The ARC CEO requested revisions to the NIT statement in 322 applications, 13 per cent of all projects that reached the CEO. Multiple revisions were requested in almost two-thirds of these cases. Disturbingly, applications to the Discovery Indigenous 2023 scheme attracted a request for NIT revisions nearly three times the average rate of NIT-picking for applications that had progressed to the CEO. NIT-picking has disproportionately interfered with the applications of Indigenous researchers. The CEO needs to explain why Indigenous research applications were subjected to more revisions than others.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2018 the Senate passed my motion which called to scrap the national interest test, as it would allow the government of the day to influence an independent research approval process. It acknowledged that the ARC already has a rigorous peer review process for assessing grant applications, and applications are required to demonstrate the benefits and impact of their research, and it called on the government to get rid of the national interest test. Labor supported the motion. Senator Carr referred to the test as Orwellian sounding and nothing more than an instrument for the further political manipulation of an independent peer review process. Nor is it needed. Senator Carr noted that scholars already have to prove the national benefit and impact of their research proposals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I ask the Labor government: what has changed now? I call on them to drop the hypocrisy and drop the Morrison era national interest test. It cannot be saved through redrafting. We should aspire to be a global research destination which has a reputation for fairness, rigour and the production of outstanding research. Amongst other things, this requires getting rid of the completely unnecessary and onerous national interest test and abolishing the political power which allows grants to be vetoed. Researchers and uni staff must have better pay and conditions, and research must be properly supported by investment and proper public funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about treating our universities as a public good rather than as corporations, that has to involve care and respect for research, including proper public funding. I will be paying close attention to the ARC review and I look forward to continuing my discussions with researchers and universities and the government on what needs to change for Australian research.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Auditor-General's performance report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">government implementation </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the National Waste Policy Action Plan</span> for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This is a very important audit report. Effective management of waste is absolutely critical to us here in Australia. It's something the Greens have been campaigning on for well over a decade because, of course, sadly, we've seen a lot of waste, especially plastic waste, make its way into the ocean and the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, creating a circular economy where everything that is produced is designed for its end of life and stays in the system—so we actually essentially eliminate waste—is absolutely critical for climate action. It doesn't matter whether the waste is organic waste, food waste, textile waste or plastic waste; if we design things for their end of life, we can create more jobs, we can have a very exciting and vibrant economy and we can eliminate a significant environmental problem while we do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, governments have a very important role to play in eliminating waste and building a circular economy. The National Waste Policy Action Plan, the NWPAP, was designed by the government in 2019 and was intended to guide investment and national efforts in Australia to reduce waste and support more sustainable resource use to 2030. To put it another way, it was to help move us along the path to creating a circular economy and getting to zero waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Auditor-General's report looked at the implementation of this national plan over the past four years. Unfortunately, the results weren't necessarily good. The Auditor-General found that the department's implementation of this national plan was only partly effective. They also found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The effectiveness of the department's implementation and coordination of actions, and monitoring and reporting of progress, is reduced by lack of agreed action scope or deliverables against which progress can be assessed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very concerned about this because the last government talked a very big talk about reducing waste and taking action, for example, on things like banning single-use plastics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to the plan, you will see there are eight key components to it. The first one is to ban the exports of waste, and we've talked about that a lot in here. The second is to reduce total waste generated in Australia by 10 per cent per person—only 10 per cent. We should be looking to eliminate waste in this country, and we can't even measure whether we've achieved that or are on a pathway to achieving that. The third target is: '80 per cent average resource recovery rate from all waste streams following the waste hierarchy by 2030.' In other words, that is getting 80 per cent towards building a circular economy by 2030. Target 4 is: 'Significantly increase the use of recycled content by governments and industry.' In other words, that is having governments buy recycled content to help the recycling industry. Target 5, which is critical to me personally, is: 'Phase out problematic and unnecessary plastics by 2025.' By the way, it's not just the Greens that want to phase out plastics—especially single-use plastics—that are killing marine life; the recycling industry wants to get rid of them because they foul up the system. They contaminate our waste streams and make recycling very difficult. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole bunch of other ones that are really critical around eliminating organic waste, or at least halving the amount of organic waste that goes to landfill by 2030. Target 7, which of course underpins all this, is: 'Make comprehensive, economy-wide and timely data publicly available to support better consumer, investment and policy decisions.' We are working with the state environment ministers and various departments to achieve this, but, unfortunately, I haven't got time to go into it today. I urge senators to read this. We'll certainly be asking questions at estimates. The report found that there is basically no way we have any idea whether we're on track to do any of this stuff. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, under the very important legislation the last government brought here, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill, we also have product stewardship schemes, where we have packaging covenants, like APCO, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, that have voluntary targets to reduce packaging waste. Do we trust the department to be on track to monitor someone like APCO to achieve their objectives? These are some big questions we have to answer following this report. You can be assured the Greens will be in here doing exactly that.</span>

Parliament cannot review our handing of COVID-19 unless the data critical to that review is made available promptly and in clear detail. We had many problems with that with both the Queensland Premier and the previous prime minister. Failure to provide that data earlier has led to harmful speculation, which timely reporting would have prevented. I note in the minister's reply that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has now committed to a publishing schedule for health related data that has the effect of returning data disclosure back to pre-COVID turnaround times—finally; at last. </span>

                    </a>  I rise to make a brief contribution on the tabling of this report. I'd like to focus my contribution on one of the listings in particular of those eight terrorist organisations, although I support the minister's decision to list and relist all of those organisations. I am referring to the listing in its entirety of Hamas as a terrorist organisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of this issue is that Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades were initially listed in November 2003 and have been repeatedly relisted by ministers for home affairs or their equivalents under governments of both persuasions until 4 August 2021. In the PJCIS's last review of that listing, under my chairmanship, we recommended that the evidence was now overwhelmingly clear that the al-Qassam Brigades of Hamas were not a discrete and separate entity to the rest of Hamas but that the entirety of Hamas was responsible, morally, ethically, legally and financially, for the terrorist activities that the al-Qassam Brigades engage in and that, in particular, the so-called civilian leadership of Hamas was, at the very least, guilty of many instances of incitement to violence that meet the definition under the act required. So we recommended for the first time that the government consider broadening that listing to cover Hamas in its entirety, and I'm very pleased that the then Minister for Home Affairs, Ms Andrews, in October 2021, received our report and then, in February 2022, agreed to the committee's recommendation and proceeded to list the organisation in its entirety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the leadership of my colleague in the other place, Mr Khalil, the new committee of the PJCIS has considered that listing and has reaffirmed and supported the minister's decision to list Hamas in its entirety. I want to thank the Labor members of the committee for their support of this listing. This is a very important bipartisan initiative to recognise that all of Hamas is responsible for its violent crimes around the world and should be held so under our law.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the thing about the veteran suicide royal commission: it didn't come about because the Liberal and Labor parties woke up one day and realised we actually needed one; it didn't happen because Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs finally admitted they have a problem. It happened because our veterans and their families made it happen. Our soldiers, our sailors and our airmen made it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took bravery, strength and a hell of a lot of resilience. It took years. Many, many people have had to bare their souls to strangers. They've shared their deepest sorrows and vulnerabilities to people who didn't want to hear them. They've had to do this over and over again just to prove how much we needed this. It has taken more than a decade, but at least we all got here in the end. It has taken 10 years, and finally the powers have sat up and listened to the men and women who live this every day of their lives. I can't tell you how many of these people from around the country, and some from overseas, have come through our office in Tassie during that period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know how many soldiers are being bullied to within an inch of their lives by their superiors in the Army? Do people know how many kids have gone in there hoping to do their country and family proud, only to come back out the other side physically broken and emotionally shattered by the people who were supposed to be their heroes? Do people know how many women have been sexually abused, harassed and hounded out around the military for no other reason than that they weren't one of the boys? I can tell you it has been thousands. Women are still dragging chairs up against their bedroom doors of a night-time, scared of the same people they're supposed to fight next to in a war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know senior people—majors, lieutenants, captains—who have spoken up about the bullying and abuse that is going on with their own diggers in their own units whose careers have been killed off. This is still going on today, even with a royal commission happening—20, 30, 40 years of service down the drain because they did the honourable thing and called out the unacceptable behaviour of their peers. They had courage, and they showed guts, and this is how we treat them and how Defence continues to treat them today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know smart, clever young recruits who have tried to look out for their mates, only to get chewed up and spat out by the power of the cover-up culture in Defence. That's what happens if you speak up in the Australian Defence Force. If you speak up, you're a troublemaker; you're a problem. It's as simple as that. What you do is you stay in the military institution. It is 'shame on you', apparently, because you must understand that it always is the institution first. Well, I have to say this to the institution: I reckon those days are all but over. And I'll make sure of it. I don't intend to go anywhere in the next three years and I certainly don't intend to go anywhere in the six years after that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That cover-up culture puts you on the backside out in civilian life, away from the world you thought would be your own until you're old and grey. You put your country first, and that's what happens to you. Good strong men and women turn into shadows of themselves. They should be serving our country, but if they speak up they're more likely to end up on the dole. The families of these people, whose kids go in so hopeful and come out so lost—we leave the mums, dads, wives and husbands to pick up the pieces. That's what we've been doing. Over the 10 years that we've been fighting for this we must have seen the same thing over and over again, hundreds of times, maybe even more. If you heard the things we've heard in my office, if you heard the things I've heard out on the streets, if you heard the things I've heard—because I've got military mates who have served and are still serving—I can tell you now, it would absolutely make your heart break.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This royal commission has to change all that. It really is our last shot. We can't ask everyone who fought for this to keep going and do more. They've given every last drop of energy and fight that they have to do this. Even here, at the highest level of inquiry you could possibly imagine, the royal commission is being blocked by the same people who have fought against it for all these years. These are the people who didn't want a royal commission. It isn't getting the information it needs to do its job, and that is not fair on the royal commission. We're putting in millions of bucks, trying to save lives, and the institution doesn't want to pass over documents. Really? It's not that difficult. And the royal commission can't ask the hard questions that it needs to ask without that paperwork. It is simple. We've set up the strongest, most powerful inquiry we can, and we can't get more powers than a royal commission. Even here, the highest form of inquiry you can get, we're coming up against roadblocks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't take it from me. Take it from the commission itself. This is what they've told us: 'We can't ask the hard questions.' They've told us they're unreasonably constrained. I know the government thinks the royal commission is wrong on this. They reckon there's no problem here. To that I say: when a royal commission tells you it needs information and it can't get it, I suggest you start listening. It obviously can't get it for a reason, and we need to fix that. We need to give them a solution. Otherwise we're wasting millions and millions of dollars once again on running some fantasy that's never going to come up with the answers we need, because we are blocking the information from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to take the royal commission seriously in what they're telling us. They say they have a problem, and it's up to us to fix it. That's what we're in here for. We debated my bill this morning to make this happen. It addresses one barrier to the royal commission's work: parliamentary privilege. You don't touch privilege lightly; I get that. I also get that I've never heard a royal commission—and correct me if I'm wrong—say that they are being blocked from getting information. Show me. Parliamentary privilege is an important part of how a parliament works. It's the thing that lets me stand here today and say what I need to say without being worried about being sued. It gives people legal protection when they come to me and say they have a problem. We've even used it to name and shame the bullies in the Australian Defence Force who are the reason we need a royal commission in the first place. But parliamentary privilege is getting in the way of the royal commission. That's because, if a report or paper is covered by privilege, that comes with a whole set of rules about how it can be used in a courtroom. A judge can't use it to make a finding. For example, you can't ask a court to use someone else's evidence in a Senate inquiry to decide if a crime has been committed. A lawyer can't use it to show you've broken the law or defamed someone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Privilege stops the veteran suicide royal commission from using evidence from parliament. It stops the commission from being able to look at Senate inquiries and Auditor-General reports. It stops the commissioners from being able to use that information to make recommendations. They can't question government officials about what they've done with that information. Instead of protecting the people who come to me and ask for help, parliamentary privilege, would you believe it, is protecting the people in power who threw the abuse out in the first place. Government officials, ministers, politicians—that's who parliamentary privilege is protecting. The royal commission can't ask public officials the questions it wants to ask because of parliamentary privilege. It can't use the evidence to build a case on what the ADF and Defence have done to fix a problem that some in parliament have pointed out for years. All those Senate inquiries, all those reports, all that evidence people gave here in parliament? It is useless to the commissioners. They can't touch it. Instead, they have to go back and do all the work again. What a load of rubbish! They're just doubling up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentary privilege shouldn't be used that way. That's not what it's for, but that's what's happening. Take this for an example: the legal officers who help the royal commissioners at public hearings wanted to ask Defence about the Auditor-General's report that looked into Defence's handling of some cultural change programs. The report was subject to parliamentary privilege, which meant the lawyers knew they had to be careful. They knew they couldn't ask the royal commissioners to use the report to make any recommendations or draw any conclusions. Like I said, you're not allowed to do that. But they really wanted to know what Defence had done in response to the report's findings. At first they tried to ask the officials broad questions about what the report said and they decided not to show any part of the report publicly, even though it's on the website for public consumption. They didn't directly quote anything that the Auditor-General said, but lawyers for the federal government didn't think it was good enough. They thought the commission would still fall foul of the laws on parliamentary privilege and be in contempt of parliament. And sure enough, a few days later the royal commissioners' lawyers had to back it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where we're at today. Something needs to be done about that. It makes no sense. This is why I've proposed a bill to reform the privileges act. We have to get to the bottom of this, and I'm very disappointed that Labor isn't listening to what the royal commission has said. We have no choice: we have to run a short Senate inquiry on this, and we need to find a way around this—now.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today, the Minister for Aged Care introduces the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022. This Bill implements a number of this Government's election commitments that will ensure older Australians receive the aged care they deserve, after a life contributing to their communities and to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also responds to recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which found significant shortcomings in the care provided to older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 to this Bill will introduce a new responsibility for approved providers of residential care and of specified kinds of flexible care. From 1 July 2023, these providers will need to have a registered nurse on site and on duty at each residential facility, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Bill includes a mechanism for exemptions, on conditions to be specified in subordinate legislation and these details will be specified following consultation with experts and the residential aged care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care will be the decision-maker in respect to any exemptions. Before granting such an exemption, the Secretary must be satisfied that the provider has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the clinical care needs of the care recipients in the facility will be met during the period for which any exemption is in force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will ensure the needs of the care recipients are central to any decision to grant an exemption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the Bill places a time limit on any exemption to a maximum period of 12-months to ensure that exemptions are regularly reviewed. To increase transparency, the Secretary will also be required to make publicly available information in relation to any exemptions that are granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This implements an election commitment of the Government and aspects of Recommendation 86 of the final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This new responsibility will save thousands of unnecessary trips to hospital Emergency Departments and will ensure that older Australians living in residential aged care have access to the nursing care they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also ensure there are more carers with more time to care. Relying on existing powers in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aged Care Act 1997</span>, the Government will progress subordinate legislation in parallel with this Bill to mandate that everyone living in a residential aged care facility receives an average of 200 minutes of care per day by 1 October 2023, and an average of 215 minutes of care per day by 1 October 2024. This will implement the remainder of Recommendation 86 of the final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. It will mean more care for every resident, every day, and not just for essential medical treatment, but also for basic, important things like helping people take a shower, get dressed or eat a meal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has committed to capping administration and management costs for people receiving home care. This will help maximise the funding available to address care needs. Currently, approaches to charging differ across providers. While providers are required to publish prices for care and package management, there is little transparency about how these prices are set and there is no cap on the amounts that may be charged. The proposed changes in Schedule 2 to the Bill will enable the Government to reduce high levels of administration and management charges, and remove providers' ability to charge care recipients for ceasing care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to improving transparency, integrity, and accountability in aged care. The amendments in Schedule 3 to the Bill will ensure that older Australians have access to more and better information on aged care services and providers, including how money is spent on residents' care. This will empower older Australians to make more informed decisions about their care and will strengthen integrity and accountability of providers and incentivise good practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister for Aged Care would also like to acknowledge and thank the Community Affairs Legislation Committee members for their time and contributions in considering this Bill. Following feedback received during the Inquiry process and subsequent report, Government moved a number of amendments to the Bill which clarify some points that would otherwise be in subordinate legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One thing has been clear throughout this process—we all have a shared goal to see older Australians receive the care they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to Recommendation 1 made by the Australian Greens, the Government consulted broadly during the drafting of both the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response Act) 2022</span>, as well as this Bill, including with aged care providers and allied health specialists. The Government will continue to consult closely with the sector and invite commentary on subordinate legislation moving forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Residential aged care providers are required to deliver and are funded for the provision of allied health services to residents under existing aged care legislation. The new Australian National Aged Care Classification (AN-ACC) funding model, implemented through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response) </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Act 2022</span> does not alter these requirements. The Government continues to collect information from aged care providers in relation to staffing costs and direct-care hours. This will give Government visibility of the provision of allied health services during and following the transition to AN-ACC and enable Government to respond as necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to Recommendation 4 made by Senator David Pocock, the Government has considered a mechanism for review in relation to an exemption decision. The Quality of Care Principles 2014 will be amended to provide for a decision of the Secretary to grant or not grant an exemption under the those Principles.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will make amendments to reduce the regulatory burden and costs for tax payers and improve compliance with tax laws. The Bill also delivers on the Government's election commitment to provide greater flexibility for downsizers aged 55 years and over to make contributions into their superannuation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 to the Bill makes it easier for small businesses to comply with their record-keeping obligations.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 to the Bill extends existing third-party reporting requirements to operators of electronic platforms in the sharing economy. Platform operators will be required to report to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) information regarding certain transactions that occur on their platforms, such as seller identification and payment details. This information will assist the ATO in its administration of the tax system and ensure sellers on these platforms are meeting their tax obligations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Small businesses will save in court and legal fees and as much as 60 days waiting for a decision, compared with the current process of applying to a State or Federal Court for a stay on debt recovery.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This modest change in the eligibility age for the downsizer program complements the Government's comprehensive plan on housing to improve access and affordability.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to associate the Greens with the disallowance motion put on by Senator Tyrrell to disallow the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Amendment (Prime Minister and Cabinet's Portfolio Measures No. 2) Regulations 2022. It has a very innocuous, almost deliberately Orwellian title. It's the regulation under which there's a sweetheart deal to deliver millions of dollars to the pet charity of the Governor-General that was cooked up between the former Prime Minister and the Governor-General over a series of fireside chats. The Labor government have said they're going to pull the funding. That's good. We support the decision. In fact, we celebrate the decision. We were pushing for the pulling of the funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is a project that has merit, then it should go through the usual procedures to have it assessed as a meritorious project and go through the usual transparency procedures for a grant. But, as the statement that came with the financial framework regulations made clear, this was a grant that managed to avoid all the usual scrutiny processes. It wasn't put up on the website. There was no competitive tendering. It was $18 million of public money being handed over to a charity which was being lobbied for by the Governor-General behind closed doors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was good to see the new government say they're not going to proceed with the funding. We support them saying they're not going to proceed with the funding. Indeed, it's something the Greens and my office had been calling for, for some considerable time. The Senate will recall that, on behalf of the Greens, I put forward a similar disallowance motion to that that's been put forward here by Senator Tyrrell. We agreed, for the tidiness of the Senate, to withdraw our motion and associate ourselves with Senator Tyrrell's motion, which has now come on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We say to the Labor government: the decision has been made to pull the funding—tick. Let's now scrub the offensive regs from the statute books—the regs that allowed for the delivery of this big chunk of public money without any scrutiny, without even being put on the website let alone allowing competitive tendering. If this leadership charity—I suppose it's called a charity—or this leadership proposal has merit, go through the usual process. Have competitive tendering. Have a proper public assessment of it. If it stacks up and it's better to spend $18 million here than $18 million on other critical projects—and I can think of about 500 that I'd put before spending money on this particular project—then by all means fund it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, this motion is doing the people of Australia a great service. It's scrubbing off some unnecessary laws. We make a lot of laws, and we could just scrub off this one, which is not only unnecessary but, if it's allowed to remain on the statute books, would still allow the government to reverse its decision and put the funding through without any kind of scrutiny or that necessary daylight that all grants should go through. For those reasons, we associate ourselves with the motion, commend Senator Tyrrell for bringing it to the Senate and look forward to the government supporting it.</span>

The government is not proceeding with the 2022-23 budget measure regarding the Australian Future Leaders Program. Funding for this measure, along with a number of other measures announced by the previous government, has been reviewed as part of the Albanese government's budget preparations. We will support the disallowance. It's actually, practically, no longer needed given we will not be funding this program.</span>

Whatever little deal was done between the Governor-General and the Prime Minister of the day is absolutely disgraceful. There is no information on it. We have no idea where this money was being spent. It was like a little boys' club gone wrong. It was disgraceful—like $18 million is $18 worth of mixed lollies. Fair dinkum! This has been absolutely disgraceful in the way it was done.</span>

I still for the life of me have not heard much out of the Governor-General explaining what this—what do they call it?—future leaders blah blah blah program was all about. It's without any detail, and yet the Governor-General is still sitting there in his position, happy to take 18 million bucks, to not be transparent with the public out there and to tell them exactly how great this program was going to be, because for $18 million he was going to get a great program. There was no doubt about that, apparently.</span>

If you can't come out with good reasoning on that 18 million bucks and where it was going, and the little deals that were done on the sidelines, maybe you don't deserve to be in that position in the first place. You're not in the military, mate. There's no more cover-up here. It's a whole different ballgame being the Governor-General.</span>

I think for us it is about just having this cleaned up and finished off properly and making sure that there is a statement very loud and clear that I don't give a stuff if you're the Governor-General. And I mean that with due respect, but you're under the same public eye as the rest of us are up here. Welcome to the real world. The military will no longer be there to cover your bottom. It doesn't work like that. </span>

I do ask the Governor-General, before I finish up, to go and have a good look at yourself, because it's absolutely unacceptable behaviour. There's nothing more you can say about that.

I won't say anything else. I think we all know where we stand on that. We'd like to finish off and make sure it is done correctly. We want to make sure that this has been an example, and that we are not going to tolerate that sort of waste, let alone without any substance to where the $18 million, or millions of dollars, was going to go, into the future, that this is just not on. </span>

It mightn't seem a lot of money when we're dealing with billions up here, but it is an absolute waste that had no substance to it whatsoever. I think that's more destroying than someone asking for some money, yet on the same note there's no instruction, there's no: what does it look like? There's absolutely nothing.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TYRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Jacqui Lambie Network Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  Thank you to Senator Shoebridge for getting things started in my absence. He did a great job, as always. I'm happy for him to step into my shoes any time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad we have a chance now to disallow this regulation. I'm hoping we take full advantage of it because it's done. There are a number of reasons to disallow this regulation, and I'm happy for senators to take their pick of whichever one they like. We should disallow this regulation because it is not transparent. It was made through a one-off grant without a competitive tender. It's fair to ask: why? It's not like there was any track record it could point to that would suggest it was a safe bet for taxpayer money. The foundation was not operational before the grant was announced. It had no staff, no office, no website and no profile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll never know the basis on which the decision to award this grant was made. We know it was hidden from public view. Grants normally get published on the government's online GrantConnect hub, and this one was not. The Governor-General was meeting with the former Prime Minister to lobby him over the project, or maybe he wasn't—it depends on who you ask. He says he wasn't lobbying for it and his office says he wasn't lobbying for it, but its director says he was meeting with the government over it. I don't know what to make of that. Let's just say it's not very transparent. Maybe you don't mind the transparency issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should disallow this because it was a waste of money. This is not just my opinion. The Treasurer confirmed that the government had concluded that the $18 million initial grant and $4 million a year of ongoing funding didn't pass muster and did not represent value for money. So it doesn't pass muster and it doesn't represent value for money. We do not need to spend $30 million over the next four years setting up a program for rich kids to get told how to rule the world. Trust me, I know a few rich kids, and they don't need any help getting told how to rule the world. They feel very well equipped to do that without help. So it's an unnecessary and wasteful spend. Maybe that doesn't bother you either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we should disallow this because it is weird. Even if you think this is a perfectly useful way to spend tens of millions of dollars of public money, this is a weird way to go about spending it. According to the ABC, the person pushing this sent emails saying the Prime Minister's office would own the project. Promotional material for the program boasts of support from organisations and individuals who apparently have nothing to do with it. The organisation was granted charity status, seemingly without doing anything. It listed a Barangaroo address as its registered office, but the address was a law firm. It's not transparent, it's not necessary and it's not normal. Nothing about this stacks up. Everything about this should go. I urge my colleagues to get rid of it by supporting this motion. It's good to see Labor scrapping the money. Let's disallow this, because it's weird and it's dumb. Let's scrap it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. It's a privilege to be able to come into this place and again speak on a bill which is part of the Albanese government's plan to restore integrity to policymaking and implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting evidence based policy is a hallmark of any good government but, unfortunately, a principle which the former coalition government was unable to uphold. Labor made it very clear during the federal election campaign that we would abolish the cashless debit card because it marginalised people and was not in any sense of the word sound public policy. There was no evidence to support that it changed behaviours or spending habits in any tangible way. On principle, no government should tell its citizens how to spend their money. This is a further example that the 'liberal' in Liberal Party of Australia no longer means 'liberty' or 'freedom'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill enables participants to progressively transition off the program from September 2022 and re-establishes income management in the Cape York region of Queensland. Communities have indicated their strong preference for support services such as alcohol and drug rehabilitation, early intervention services for domestic violence, and education and childhood programs to remain in place following the abolition of the CDC. This is welcome news because we know that good outcomes rise when communities embrace autonomy over their own futures. The government will be consulting further with the CDC communities about the future of the support services that have been funded through the CDC program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is a government of consultation, cooperation and negotiation because it equates to better outcomes for people and communities. As a society we must move away from the privatisation of welfare, which occurred under the previous government. Governments should never demonise individuals or communities, or play individuals and communities off against one another. Our government will not do that. We have been elected by the people, and we must govern in the national interest and not leave anyone behind. There is something deeply unjust and simply wrong when private, for-profit companies control people's welfare and income support payments. It's just wrong. I've seen study after study that shows that the CDC or payment schemes similar to it, especially in New Zealand, did not cooperate or work effectively. There is literally no evidence to support that it works, and those opposite should accept the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, unfortunately, the former government spent $170 million on the CDC program—money that could, quite frankly, have been better invested in support services within those local communities. Our government, the Albanese Labor government, will continue to consult with Indigenous communities and the entire community, including stakeholders, to ensure people understand this process and are not worse off. Transition arrangements will include an extension communication strategy and in-person engagement in each CDC site.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to bring our communities with us. We want to make sure they understand these changes because we want these changes to really matter to them and improve their lives. Participants who transition off the CDC will be able to opt out of the program from 19 September, engaging with Social Services officers to seek additional information and support, including choosing to opt in for voluntary income management, to set up a Centrepay arrangement where there is a need or to receive a referral to available local services. This is a good outcome for all involved. Every Australian deserves the same opportunities in life, and it is up to the government to harness those positive opportunities and outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing policy was created to divide and demonise certain communities. It was the government of the day saying to you: 'You're different. You can't be trusted with social security, so we will determine how you should spend your money.' The Albanese government looks forward to this bill coming into law so the cashless debit card will not be forced on our fellow Australians again. I urge senators, and particularly those on the other side, to accept the fact that their policy—when they had policy—was bad policy. It was wrong and it did not achieve the outcomes that they sought to believe were going to happen. I urge people to support this bill.</span>

You may have heard this quote before in this debate, but that is testament to how important it is to hear the quote and to really take it on board. It is:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The quote, which really struck a chord with me, came from the founder and director of strategy of the Cape York Partnership, Noel Pearson, who is widely regarded and respected as an elder who speaks with firsthand knowledge of these issues and who is very, very focused on closing the gap and on initiatives that support his people and Indigenous people around Australia. We've also had concerns raised by other organisations who work at the coalface of some of these communities who are actively working to close the gap, foundations like the Minderoo Foundation, which has said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are concerned the decision to abolish the CDC is being rushed through the Parliament without appropriate or meaningful community consultation.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card was introduced by the former coalition government after multiple examples of alcohol abuse, domestic violence, gambling and addiction that resulted in many, many families going hungry and being victims of abuse and deprivation. The cashless debit card has been described as 'an innovative program designed to tackle social harm particularly associated with drug and alcohol addiction in communities with high rates of long-term social security dependency'. When the Albanese government first announced their intention to remove this program without consultation, on unsubstantiated claims of human rights abuses and after running a massive scare campaign up and down the east coast of New South Wales, those who had firsthand experience of the benefits of this innovation knew what the consequences would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims it has consulted. Senator Polley, though, actually highlighted what the truth is, because she just explained that the government is starting the consultation. So they didn't consult before they made this announcement. Whatever consultation they think they might have conducted must have been scant and meaningless, and I suspect there was never really any real intention to find evidence of the success of the program; otherwise why would they now be backtracking? Senator Polley said they want to bring the communities along with them. I'm sorry, it's too late when the bulldozer is already rolling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see the panic now in the government with the hurried announcement last Friday that people on the cashless debit card will leave the program from early October, because the bulldozer is taking off, but a new 'enhanced' card will be available to people who choose to remain on income management. This new, improved, voluntary card will also somehow be available at more than the one million merchants the existing card is available at, as well as online shopping and BPAY. If the work has been done to ensure the technology and systems and compatibilities are in place to deliver this, that is the fastest I have ever seen a government and a department and a social welfare system work. In our experience, rolling out the necessary EFTPOS arrangements to these additional merchants will take much longer than the few days since the announcement was made to when new arrangements will supposedly start in October.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also told that a further bill is coming. They must be realising the devastation that might ensue from this cancellation of the CDC. A further bill will be coming, with the social services minister saying there would be an 18-month consultation process with affected communities to decide what the future of income management will look like. Wouldn't you think this consultation should have happened before the cancellation of the existing program, an existing program that works? This is putting the cart before the horse in every sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also announced millions of dollars in additional social support for communities transitioning off the card. They wouldn't need those social supports if you'd left the card in place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These last-minute changes we are now seeing from the government can surely only be an admission that Labor got it very wrong in the first place and that their election propaganda was based on little evidence and no consultation with those who have firsthand experience, those who attended the committee hearings that Senator Hughes attended, those that Senator Pocock heard from in his committee hearings. Had the government consulted properly they would have heard that abolishing the cashless debit card would give the green light to more alcohol, drug abuse and violence as per the quotes I read at the start of my contribution. And, while the affected families and communities are the voices that absolutely should be front and centre of this debate, they are not alone in recognising the benefits of the CDC.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims there is no evidence that a CDC works, yet there have been more than a dozen evaluations of income management which have provided consistent evidence about welfare quarantining. The evaluations show decreases in drug and alcohol issues; decreases in crime, violence and antisocial behaviour; improvements in child health and wellbeing; improvements in financial management; and ongoing and even strengthened community support. One such evaluation by the University of Adelaide released in 2021 reported that the cashless debit card had helped recipients improve their lives and the lives of their families and other community members. That report, which obviously Senator Rice does not include as evidence, found that 25 per cent of people reported they were drinking less since being put on the CDC; 21 per cent of cashless debit card participants reported gambling less; evidence found cash previously used for gambling had been redirected to essentials such as food; and 45 per cent of the CDC participants reported the cashless debit card had improved things for them and their families.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do not believe the government's rhetoric. And do not believe the claims of the Greens members, who are sitting in this chamber heckling away, who didn't attend the committee hearings, who were not there and who are ignoring the voices of the very people who they claim to represent and who they claim to want to help.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 17,000 people currently on the CDC, 4,398 of them in the Northern Territory are on it voluntarily. I'm also advised that most participants in Cape York are on it voluntarily. If it didn't work, if they didn't see value in the card, why would they be volunteering to be on the program?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to monitor more closely the impacts on those families who withdraw from the card. I urge the government to listen to the members and senators in this place who have firsthand experience of what families faced before the card was introduced and how those families' lives have changed since.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Labor really aren't interested in representing the vulnerable communities in South Australia or in the Goldfields in Western Australia, or the families in Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Cape York who benefited from the CDC. I know they're pandering to the progressives in the city, far removed from the problems they are blind to, who think they're doing the right thing by our vulnerable communities but who really aren't. I say drop the scales from your eyes and look at the hard truth of the issue. Listen to the Noel Pearsons of the world. Listen to the families and the women who are asking for the cashless debit card to remain in place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I would like to start by acknowledging the strongly divided and deeply held views in this chamber on this bill. I have engaged with all sides in consideration of this legislation. I thank Senators Ruston and Rice and other senators for their time during committee hearings, hearing tragic stories from people whose lives are being affected. I would also like to thank Minister Rishworth for genuinely listening and taking on board ideas to deliver better outcomes for the communities affected by the legislation, and Senator Reynolds for the encouragement to travel to committee hearings to hear for myself. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience, my first committee hearing as a senator for the ACT. I attended the committee hearing in Darwin and read the submissions to the Senate inquiry. I have since met with a range of other stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've tried to look at the available evidence and have listened to the stories and evidence from affected communities. I've heard the arguments for and against. What is clear to me from all of this is that compulsory income management has to end. What's also apparent is that there are individuals who want a voluntary form of income management that utilises the technology of the CDC. There are communities who want to be able to decide for themselves who they put on income management, through their own self-determined processes. Throughout the last few months I've worked with the government on this bill, and I commend them for making amendments based on some of these conversations and, I'm sure, many others. The main concerns I raised were protecting the Family Responsibilities Commission and the framework in place in Cape York, ensuring that the CDC is still available to them. Clearly this is something they want. They rate it as much more functional than the BasicsCard, and we have to ensure that they can continue with the work that they're doing up there. We need to ensure that people on the CDC in the NT do not have to go back onto the BasicsCard, which is clearly an inferior technology. We need to ensure that people who would like to keep income management on a voluntary basis have the ability to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, we need to end all compulsory income management, and this bill does not do that. It simply allows the government to take people off the CDC. We need to continue to push the government to ensure that they prioritise ending all forms of compulsory income management. While I would like to have a time line from the government regarding the ending of all income management, these changes and the funding for support services outlined over the weekend are clearly a first step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The research and the majority of the evidence given during the Senate committee hearings overwhelmingly shows that the CDC is not addressing the problems it was designed to address. I would like to reiterate that, with the changes negotiated with government, anyone who still wants to utilise income management can still access it on a voluntary basis. This is something we heard consistently during the committee hearing process. I welcome the government's commitment to support services and to co-designing them with communities. A more holistic approach is clearly needed—a focus on co-design and ensuring that communities are empowered to make decisions for themselves to solve their own problems, to partner with communities and work alongside them rather than dictate from Canberra what they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that on this issue a Voice to Parliament would be something that would provide consultation and advice on an issue that overwhelmingly—disproportionately—affects First Nations people. The referendum to enshrine a Voice in our Constitution is something I look forward to working on with my colleagues in this place and with other Australians, to take this step forward for our great country and to begin to write a new chapter together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is far from perfect. But it is clearly a first step and is needed, and any significant delay in its passage will subject people to further distress. So I'll be supporting this bill.</span>

                    </a>
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">LLE SMITH</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  The Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022 implements the government's election commitment to end a program that has never lived up to its promises. The cashless debit card, implemented over six trial sites across Australia, was designed to deliver a lot. The former government claimed it would help to address adverse behaviours relating to drug and alcohol misuse in communities by quarantining a proportion of a person's welfare payment. But the evidence from numerous evaluations, inquiries and audits simply isn't there to demonstrate that this program delivered on its objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And now, the legislation that underpins the program is due to sunset on 31 December. The bill before us allows for the transition away from the CDC to be considered and staged. It is in response to the sunsetting of that legislation. The issues confronted in the legislation before us are tough and they are complex. I actually chaired the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this, where we heard from representatives from across all of the trial sites in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard firsthand the lived experiences of many of those on the card. We heard how it had stripped away people's rights and left them feeling ashamed and humiliated and stigmatised; that it left people unable to buy basic necessities like second-hand school uniforms because there simply wasn't enough cash at hand; of kids being kept home from school to avoid the humiliation of not being able to give the $2 donation needed for an ice cream day on Friday because the cash was gone. And we heard of the workarounds being used to get cash, that compounded disadvantage and which demonstrated that a card—a piece of technology—in and of itself, can never and will never be a simple and single cure-all to drug and alcohol dependency. The reality being that without the right social help, and services to support people, these dependencies continue and they continue to cause harm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we heard during this inquiry was not greatly different from what I've heard on the ground in Ceduna in South Australia, where I've travelled with the then shadow minister for social services, Linda Burney, and our now Minister for Social Services, Amanda Rishworth, in my work advocating for the Yadu Health clinic. On these visits I sat by Minister Burney and Minister Rishworth's sides as they heard similar stories: that the CDC was stigmatising individuals, restricting their access to the second-hand economy and limiting the ability of communities to make collective financial decisions. In several instances, I was told that, where people felt there may have been a positive impact for the program, it wasn't the card per se but the wraparound support services that were implemented—not always to the extent they were promised, mind you—alongside it. Again, we heard of the workarounds that were happening that were leaving some of the most vulnerable in that community worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that for too many people this card, this program, hasn't worked as it was designed to. Indeed, it has made things worse for far too many Australians. I won't pretend that all experiences on the card, or views of the card, are universal. They're not. And I don't pretend to speak on behalf of everyone in the community of Ceduna or elsewhere. As I said, this is a complex issue and it's a complex issue in South Australia. There are supporters of the card as a mechanism for income management, including in Ceduna, and those concerned to see the transition done right. In Cape York, concerns were raised with the committee, as I said, in the inquiry I chaired, about the impact of the legislation on the continued operation of their unique model and the work of the Family Responsibilities Commission. Our inquiry heard these issues, we took them seriously and, as a result, we made a number of recommendations and added commentary in our report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really struggling to follow the commentary earlier from opposition senators that the government shouldn't have responded to the committee's recommendations, that by responding to these issues there was somehow a failure here. That is absolute nonsense. I've heard so much nonsense on the consultation argument from members of the former government, who never properly consulted before forcing people on this card—forcing them on it punitively in places like Bundaberg, where young people were put on this card without any consultation and without any choice. To the idea that the minister was somehow meant to consult before she was a minister, they know full well the former shadow minister has been out there for years listening to people on this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Minister Rishworth is personally and deeply committed to getting this right and to leaving individuals better off. I thank her for the work on the amendments that the government is bringing forward, and the recent announcements that will be brought forward to address the concerns that have been raised. That is an appropriate response. That is what happens when you genuinely listen, like the minister has.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to talk through some of these things. Firstly, there were the concerns raised about technology. An updated income management technology solution with an enhanced card will be available as a voluntary income management tool for those who want to use it, providing access to more merchants, and facilitating BPAY and online shopping. This is in direct response to submissions to our inquiry. But critically, this enhanced technology will be delivered by Services Australia, removing the interface with a private company for customer support, and will enhance support. It is not a punitive measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the transition, of course, needs to be staged, with individual support for those who need it to come off the card. The legislation allows for this, and the minister has made it clear that Services Australia will provide front-of-house staff in trial sites throughout the transition. And the transition, of course, needs to be backed up with services that are well funded, co-designed and geographically, culturally and linguistically accessible. This is something our committee inquiry discussed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has announced that the government will continue current community support services, where funding was set to expire under the former government, and will invest $17 million in additional community led and designed initiatives to support economic and employment opportunities. In Ceduna, in my home state, this will see some essential support services, such as the community bus for children who don't have access to other forms of transport, that were set to have their funding expire next year continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, $49.9 million will be provided for additional alcohol and other drug treatment services and support in four of the cashless debit card trial sites. There was some interesting commentary in the chamber earlier today, but I would remind the chamber that this was support actually promised by the former government, just never delivered. So if that announcement, in itself, is an admission of failure or an admission of error in anyone's policies, it is that government's own. I'm really proud that our committee's work has encouraged these commitments. That is what happens when a committee does its job. The idea that us making these recommendations and comments, which have led to better policy, is somehow a failure I find absurd. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Cape York, the government always intended for this unique model to continue. Let's have some facts on the table when it comes to this debate. Where issues were raised that there may be some unintended consequences in the legislation which would impede this work, we made recommendations. Our inquiry made recommendations for these to be worked through. The government is bringing forward amendments to this end which allow the work in Cape York to continue. I note those amendments have been welcomed by the Family Responsibilities Commission. I will also say that, for communities around the country who want their own model of community based voluntary income management, including in Ceduna, if that is what the community decides it does want there, the minister left the door open on that too. These facts are important in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that emotions run high. As I said, these are tough and complex issues, but facts matter, and of course a lot of work remains ahead in the Northern Territory on the future of voluntary income management. Not all of this work can or should happen overnight. To this end, I acknowledge the contribution to this debate made earlier by my colleague Senator McCarthy. If you missed her contribution, go back and listen to it because she could certainly teach a few in this chamber a thing or two about respect, about dialogue and about consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents the start of the government's work to end what has clearly been a failed program, to end the blanket imposition of compulsory broad-based income management that the evidence simply does not support. But, of course, there is more work ahead.</span>

                    <a href="263528" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NAMPIJINPA PRICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I have not been in this chamber very long, but it is not hard to see the trickery, the deceit and the lengths that this Albanese Labor government will go to to maintain lies and shallow election promises that were only ever about attempting to secure woke votes. The saying 'if you repeat something enough times, it becomes the truth' should be Labor's motto, as this is exactly how this government has demonised the cashless debit card in order to justify its election promise to abolish it. We've heard from out-of-touch Greens senator Rice, who, I realise, had her fingers stuck in her ears when vulnerable Aboriginal Australians told her in the inquiry they desperately need the cashless debit card. We have heard from Senator McCarthy from the Territory talk about the Intervention and how it supposedly shamed adults, but she failed to admit it was the Northern Territory Labor government of the time that she was a minister of that sat on and did nothing about the <span style="font-style:italic;">Little </span><span style="font-style:italic;">children are sacred</span> report. It was this report, highlighting the astronomical rates of child sexual abuse and STIs found in Aboriginal children, which was the trigger for federal action. Labor and the Greens continue to this day to ignore the suffering of vulnerable children instead of favouring the rights of abusers, perpetrators and adults controlled by addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It hasn't mattered a single iota that this was a grassroots initiative in its very first instance, that the origins of the card came about because of the calls from vulnerable communities for a tool to curb spending on alcohol, drugs and gambling by vulnerable community members, nor the fact that alcohol in these regions desperate for the card had some of our nation's highest rates of child sexual abuse. We know because the evidence—not a repeated lie but the evidence—tells us that alcohol has played a colossal role in child sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities. The stark evidence tells us loud and clear that alcohol plays an astronomical role in the rates of violence and abuse in Aboriginal communities—the very reasons these communities called for the development of the cashless debit card in the first place. I hear very little about the concern for children from across the chamber. How ironic that a grassroots initiative is now being scrapped to satisfy the uninformed demands of the elites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know these communities are far from the comfy lives that many of the members of this government live. We're told regularly that this government respects Aboriginal culture. We're told every single day you all acknowledge elders past, present and emerging, whatever that actually means, yet this government doesn't actually know Indigenous culture because none of you have lived it—really lived it or really lived in it. You think you may have been witness to it, but it's more than just parading around in animal fur, more than just putting some paint on one's face or playing a didjeridu, an instrument that belongs only to the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land. It's more than just walking through a bit of smoke. In fact, smoking ceremonies were never traditionally used at every single occasion and get together. They were precisely only used after the death of a relative, for medicinal purposes or to strengthen a newborn baby.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government romanticises what it doesn't know and pays lip service when it's convenient. It's not just this government; the Greens all the time. Some cultural truths I know it will be hard to comprehend for many here: what it's like to constantly have your income demanded from you by addicted relatives on a regular basis; that everything you own, including the clothes on your back, can be taken from you because 'cultural protocol' dictates that you have to say yes and hand over your income, even if it means your kids go hungry. It is hard to comprehend that saying no to these demands is a breach of cultural protocol. The consequences of such culturally unacceptable refusal can lead to violent punishment. This is fact, people. Fact. I lived this culture, but this is the lived cultural experience of many. This is the protocol that has been embedded into one's psyche and passed down through generations. Members of this government could not fathom the oppressive actuality of not being encouraged or empowered to stand up for oneself and be able to say no. Communal living means consent does not belong to you as an individual. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many here will never understand, because our Western based democratic Australian culture upholds our individual rights, our Western based democratic Australian culture gives you freedom of choice, our Western based Australian democratic culture gives you the freedom to turn a blind eye in the name of political correctness to the oppressive elements of culture that belongs to our most vulnerable citizens. In fact, this government encourages and promotes separatism—the 'us and them' mentality which sustains the breeding ground for cultural dysfunction. The favourable choice is niceties in reinvented cultural acknowledgements to country; strategically placing the Aboriginal flag in this chamber, or behind oneself at every speaking opportunity, to display ones virtues while ignoring the glaring and the disturbing intrinsic reality that plagues the lives of vulnerable Australian citizens—Australian citizens that I have been burying all of my life in communities that are far removed and out of sight, out of mind from the privileged circumstances we're all a part of here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way a member of this government might feel pressured into giving the shirt off their back or all the money in their account to an addict, to the detriment of themselves or their children, is if they're under duress, in a toxic relationship, the victim of domestic violence or if they're an enabler themselves, but certainly not because it's their cultural obligation to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine receiving an urgent and dreadful call from your mother that she has been informed that your aunt, a woman you've loved all your life, a jovial and warmer character but an excessive drinker in her late 30s, has dropped dead on the town campground after spending consecutive nights drinking. Imagine arriving in the town camp to find she still lies in the same place on the dirt where she collapsed and died. Your other aunt is letting off heart-wrenching screams over her body. Other family—aunts; uncles; cousins; children; your young nieces and nephews, some as young as four, some in their teens—watch on. Some are in distress at the scene and some are unemotional—probably numb from the hysteria and the sight of yet another death of a loved one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine now your own children witnessing something like this. You think to yourself that it's not right that the little ones should be witnessing this. The police arrive. You are told politely that it might be best, given the circumstances, for family members to lift her body into the body bag and onto the stretcher. You want for your aunt to have dignity in those last moments. You want to get her off the ground but you also know she has now been taken away forever. This is one of many of my lived experiences of destruction by alcohol—the way in which it has taken away the lives of my family. I have many more stories to share but I won't today. Instead, I will fight to support the measures that are pertinent to curbing the destruction of alcohol where it collides with a culture that we're continually told is the world's oldest living culture, a culture I've lived. I've come to understand that during the thousands of years of its existence it has not yet developed the tools and mechanisms to successfully overcome addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addiction is a human affliction. The triggers for it within Aboriginal Australians have come from modern environmental influences; hence, why there are no cultural preventions for it. However, it becomes even more dangerous when cultural obligations are exploited by addicts and abusers. These are the very reasons why it is our responsibility as lawmakers in this nation to: (1) seek a deeper and more honest understanding of the authentic cultural practices that influence, and at times dictate, the lives of the vulnerable; and (2) make sound and sometimes tough decisions that work to uphold the human rights of the vulnerable as a priority before those who would destroy their lives and the lives of others. One life lost is one too many. It is not good enough to sacrifice any lives in the name of political correctness or for the shallow exercise of winning votes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an educational experience so far learning of the procedures we undertake to determine outcomes for our nation and the approaches we are confined to by way of committee. The cashless debit card repeal inquiry was strategically and deliberately rushed through by this government, leaving little to no contribution from vulnerable community members unable to access the support needed to provide a submission. People whose first language is not English and whose level of education impedes their ability to communicate efficiently and swiftly, but who need the cashless debit card the most, were effectively excluded from participating. This came as no surprise, given that Labor primarily give access to and heed only the voices of educated conformists who reflect their values and support their endeavours. I've come to understand that calling a swift inquiry with a short time frame and minimal opportunity for travel to affected remote communities allows for the stacking of submissions in favour of a particular position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were many calls for funds reserved for operation of the cashless debit card to be transferred to social service providers instead. When I questioned a service provider on the specifics of how their service might be a better alternative to the cashless debit card, a detailed and precise answer could not be given. Noel Pearson made some poignant remarks during the delivery of his evidence and pleas to maintain the cashless debit card. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… services are important—what people most need, what families most need, is more opportunity. Give them opportunity directly. We only think of services because it's the only way we think about how we support poor people. The bureaucrats see a problem, they design a program, they allocate a bureaucrat or a service deliverer with a four-wheel drive, a fax machine and everything else, but it doesn't do anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You've got to remember, we're urging you: service delivery is parasitic too. It's parasitic on the disadvantaged. It sees the disadvantaged people as a cause for a program and a job, and it doesn't do much to change their situation … So when you use the words 'service delivery', some of that is crucial mental health services and a whole lot of child protection services—they're really important—but a lot of it is rubbish too. It actually is feasting on disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I learnt that, despite the many invitations and pleas made by one of the shire mayors of a trial site to meet Minister Rishworth and Minister Burney to discuss the critical need for the cashless debit card, in the end they were simply ignored. I also learnt that Minister Rishworth met Aboriginal women from remote communities during her rushed consultations who told her they were grateful for income management—that it was a lifesaver for them. Possibly, despite the representations of pious inner-city academics far removed from the lives of the marginalised and their culture, despite the demands from service providers in favour of income management abolition and redirecting funds, the few voices of the deeply concerned and vulnerable might cut through. Perhaps this government can no longer maintain the con that demonises the cashless debit card. After all, if the card was not working, then why is the government making it voluntary? Why abolish the cashless debit card in favour of maintaining the inferior and restrictive technology of the BasicsCard?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the weekend, I read that Labor plan to replace the CDC with another card. This card will have updated technology and, no doubt, a whole new bright shiny name. So the government want us to believe it is scrapping the cashless debit card, as was the election commitment, when in fact it is keeping it and pretending to create a new one. The time and resources invested by the former coalition government to make immense improvements to the BasicsCard by way of introducing the cashless debit card have been completely overlooked for ideological reasons by the government and its supporters. On the same basis, they disregarded the 2021 University of Adelaide evaluation that found a quarter of the people on the cashless debit card reported they drank less frequently, and 45 per cent of recipients said it had improved their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card works, and it always has, but the government must continue its con. Once you start a lie, you have to stick with it. It evolves and takes on a life of its own, as we have come to see. Again it's been a waste of our time and resources watching on while Labor rearrange the deckchairs on the sinking ship of Aboriginal community life, knowing full well that pulling the rug from clean under these vulnerable people, in the name of political correctness, is going to destroy lives. It's all smoke and mirrors. Albanese is the ringmaster of this circus, Rishworth is the illusionist and, with their colleagues, they put the heads of the vulnerable into the mouths of the lions while the taxpayers watch on, either cheering with approval or, like those with any real comprehension of the danger, gasping in dismay. Only when your intentions are driven by your concern for this nation and its people instead of your disdain for the opposition and hunger for votes will you actually find some real solutions for Indigenous people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. It is absolutely no secret that the Greens oppose income management. We believe that a socially just, democratic and sustainable society rests on the provision of an unconditional liveable income for everybody complemented by the provision of universal social services. We are pleased that this discriminatory, oppressive scheme is finally being repealed, but we are deeply disappointed that it has absolutely taken too long. This is well overdue and is just one of the many steps this country must take to stop the ongoing colonialism and oppression of First Nations people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, my predecessor, former senator Rachel Siewert, wrote in a dissenting report to the community affairs inquiry into this bill that established the trials:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite claims by the Government the proposed debit card is an extension of Income Management. Compulsory Income Management is a failed measure, which impacts negatively on the community and imposes significant costs on Government. Evidence provided through submissions and oral evidence to this inquiry show the fundamental problems in this approach.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, the Greens, were ringing the alarm bells, saying even before it was enacted that this would be a disaster. Compulsory income management has consistently failed to benefit the people and communities upon which it has been imposed, and more often than not they are in fact First Nations people.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no clear evidence that compulsory income management works or even leads to improvement of the lives of those who are subjected to these measures, so you can concoct any type of evaluation you want. One of the reasons for reducing income management is alcohol and drug related problems, particularly in the Northern Territory, but there is actually no evidence that these problems have been improved by the imposition of compulsory income management.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Human Rights Commission has also stated that the application of the cashless debit card has not been shown to be reasonable, necessary or proportionate. The CDC places unnecessary limits on economic, social and cultural human rights and undermines the right to self-determination. Now, I don't know what people from the other side think but, clearly, what we've been fighting for for 230-plus years is our right to self-government and our right to self-determination. The CDC does not respect an individual's agency or their rights.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stakeholders have referred to this program as 'collective punishment' and to the continuation of that. The impacts of this scheme have been absolutely devastating for people in communities. The cashless debit card prevents people from even taking cash out. But many survive on cash because they can't afford to buy things from the shop. Now, imagine not being able to buy things from the shop—people not being able to do that for themselves. That's about access. They purchase their clothes and their household items from op shops and garage sales and they purchase their food from farmers markets and roadside stalls. They don't get the privilege, like everybody else in this place, to go to the shop to buy the things they need, because they're on the CDC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One single mother stated: 'In three years, I've been subjected to the ludicrous thing that CDC has (1) attempted to prevent me from accessing a private speech therapist in community'—it has restricted her from doing that—'prevented me from using my tax return to buy my son a bedroom suite. Just think: put a bunch of people with no mental health, disability or domestic violence skills in charge of my financial situation in an arbitrary way,' and I bet that wouldn't happen to anyone in this place. She continued: 'When my ex-husband treated me this way, the Family Court called it financial control.' The fact is that the former government was never allowed to subject people to this level of control. If this same behaviour was by a partner or carer, they would actually call this financial abuse. It's absolutely barbaric.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stated earlier, the CDC has a disproportionate impact on First Nations people. It is not about a postcode lottery. In fact, it is done and crafted and measured in a way whereby it will disproportionately impact on First Nations people. So make no mistake: the CDC is a continuation of colonialism in this country. It seeks to normalise policies that control First Nations people. It perpetuates the stigmatisation that we've just heard from across the chamber and in former speeches of First Nations people, as opposed to recognising their sovereignty and addressing the impacts of the collective and generational trauma that are the result of the attempted genocide of over 200 years of oppression in this country. I don't know how many times we have to say it. We said it last week during our other speeches.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CDC makes people more dependent on welfare rather than building capacity and independence; I don't have to say this, because I've lived that experience. But it's also a provision of the social safety nets provided globally, acknowledged by the WTO, the IPO and ESCAP in their definitions of how important that is. It's particularly important to our women and our children, as the former speaker mentioned.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government have constantly shared their support for stage 3 tax cuts, saying to the public: 'This is your money. We're just giving it back to you.' Clearly this is a sentiment that only applies to white people in this country. It doesn't apply to blackfellas. If this government acknowledges the racist nature of this program and the harm it's doing, why shift some people to compulsory management through the BasicsCard, which is simply controlling us in the same way but under a different name—same-same, no different. We need to abolish all forms of compulsory income management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to echo the comments of my colleague Senator Rice, who spoke very eloquently about the provisions of this bill that allow the minister to move people from the cashless debit card, once it's abolished, to other forms of compulsory income management. This, again, is simply unacceptable. We need to abolish all forms of compulsory income management, not just the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot of unfinished business in this country. We are the only Commonwealth country that doesn't have a treaty with its first people. We are yet to enact legislation to enshrine the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Our children continue to be stolen at unacceptable rates. In my state alone I am 17 times more likely than a white woman to lose my children. Just think about that for a moment—I come from five generations of stolen generations—and the amount of anxiety that that causes for my family. Think about First Nations people, who are the most incarcerated people in the world—with the fastest-growing prison population in the world being First Nations women in this country. We have a serious problem with colonialism, which is the legacy of colonisation in this country. The repealing of this card is just one of the many steps we need to take to heal this country, to provide justice and peace for First Nations people so that we can move forward.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  The Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022 is the first legislative step towards abolishing this paternalistic control of people's lives that was put forward by the former government. It delivers on the Albanese government's election promise to right this wrong through meaningful consultation and engagement with Australian communities affected by the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The card commenced in 2016, which was followed by more than six years of confused mismanagement—mismanagement synonymous with the cashless debit card, and mismanagement that led to day-to-day interference, chaos and difficulty in people's lives affected by this card. Enough is enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purported purpose of the card was to minimise the social harms caused by excessive alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling. But of course this was a one-size-fits-all solution, targeting every social security recipient who was receiving JobSeeker payments with a cashless debit card. I personally heard stories from the Kimberley about people having their rent payments not go through because of this system, and about numerous other hardships that took a long time to resolve in a very difficult bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government totally ignored all of these issues within the community. The former government was prepared to put forward what was obviously a racially targeted policy. It purports that it wasn't racially targeted because it targeted everyone in these communities, but if you look at the Aboriginality demographics of these communities it's very clear what the last government's motivation was. This is but one example of the many examples of the Labor Party having to undo and fix an ill-thought-out system that the previous government slapped onto the Australian public. There was no empirical evidence used in this program and it has instead led to people becoming more dependent rather than less dependent on social services. We can see that very clearly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This program has burdened people's lives and has produced no evidence that it has delivered on its objective. You only need to go to the Auditor-General's report to see that. It certainly hasn't been a cost saver—not that it should be, but the former government spent $170 million on a privatised cashless debit card program. That's $170 million which could have been invested in locally run support services or putting money in the pockets of the needy—the families experiencing hardship. The former government had promised services to go along with the CDC—services that most often, in the eyes of the community, did not eventuate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month I was privileged, with other members of the Community Affairs Committee of the Senate, to visit towns and communities affected by the CDC. We sought information on how the CDC affected people's lives on a day-to-day basis. But we also asked what was actually wanted and needed in these areas—what was needed to recover from the fact that these communities had been very much knocked around by the CDC, a card that has limited buying power to such an extent that it disadvantaged users within their local economy and stigmatised them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been very keenly felt in my own home state of WA, where in the East Kimberley it's difficult to get people to talk to you about the CDC. It's difficult because they're scared of government and they're also scared of what will be done without their consent if they speak out. But once you peel beneath that surface they feel stigmatised. And they've experienced chaos, confusion and difficulty in managing their day-to-day finances, in paying their rent, in being able to take children on school excursions, and in a range of day-to-day tasks that we would expect households right around the country to be able to take for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wyndham has been a test site since 2016 and the local evidence shows that people have felt it. They talk about the shame of not being able to make their own financial decisions, about the frustration of not being able to freely use their money in the most effective way possible. It was a broad-brush approach across the whole community, irrespective of whether any of those families had a problem that needed support. It made support services less effective because our social security system proffered no guidance or support to help reach out to those people and families that actually might have needed help for drug, alcohol or gambling problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report we put forward recommends that this bill be passed. It is a message this government has heard widely and universally. It is time to listen to the people impacted by this card, who we are trying to help, and to stop ignoring their rights.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  It is with real sadness that I rise today to speak on the repeal of the cashless debit card. I was part of its design back in 2016-17. I engaged directly as part of the team that went out and engaged with the communities on the ground. I heard from communities on the ground about the need for such a card and such a program, so it is with real sadness that I am here now speaking on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022—this Albanese Labor government's blatant and disappointing disregard for the welfare of those living in outer remote Indigenous communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill, we're seeing that the Albanese government have been obsessed with repealing the cashless debit card. They have shown, frankly, that they have no understanding whatsoever of the devastating impact this bill will have on some of our nation's most vulnerable communities. They have no compassion for those suffering from the most horrific abuse and trauma, which will be exacerbated by the alcohol and drugs that will pour into these communities across the country. As my colleague in the other place the member for Deakin said, this will inflict misery back into the vulnerable communities in places like the East Kimberley, the Goldfields in my home state of Western Australia, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland and indeed Ceduna in South Australia. I have been to each of these communities. I went to most of them years before the cashless debit card was ever implemented and I have been to them while the card has been in operation. I can tell you firsthand that there is a stark difference. But don't just take my word for it; listen to the people on the ground living in these communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor claim that they have been listening to the feedback from these vulnerable communities. They claim that they value and respect the process for consulting with these communities. But why is it these communities have said repeatedly there has been no community consultation prior to the tabling of this legislation? Are the people in these communities not telling the truth? We know the truth. The truth is that Labor only started engaging with communities after the legislation was introduced into that other place. They talk about consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee inquiry that I was a part of—I sat in on it—didn't even go to the CDC sites of Ceduna, the Goldfields or East Kimberley. Moreover, the government only gave stakeholders less than a week to put in a submission. What sort of consultation is that? How open are you actually to receiving feedback when you give them one week? The only people who have time are those who have people on their payroll ready to put submissions like this in. So what did we have? We had all of these academics, organisations based in the cities—Sydney and Melbourne. If you want to hear from people on the ground, you need to give them more than one week, because they are busy running their lives, busy getting the kids to school, making sure their grandkids are going to school. Those opposite have completely disregarded them; it is shameful. The lack of respect for communities that fought hard to see this card put in place in their communities is absolutely shameful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is coming from a government, a Prime Minister no less, that is out there pushing for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, and on its very first test to listen to these communities, to let them have their voices heard, it didn't give them a voice at all. It didn't listen to the communities on the ground. The Albanese Labor government presumes to know what these vulnerable communities need without asking them. It's the height of hypocrisy. The Albanese Labor government presumes to speak for these vulnerable communities without speaking to them first. The Albanese Labor government presumes to represent these vulnerable communities, but it doesn't. It doesn't have a mandate from these communities, because it's not listening to the people who live in these communities who are being protected by the cashless debit card from the lawless and antisocial behaviours stemming from drug and alcohol abuse, from domestic violence stemming from drug and alcohol abuse and from sexual assault stemming from drug and alcohol abuse which will only get worse without the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Granted, the CDC was part of the Labor Party election campaign, and we have heard Labor members get up time and again in this debate, talking about how they took it to the Australian people and the people voted. That's true. It was clear they were going to abolish it. We all knew it. So explain to me how the member for Hinkler won his seat, the member for Durack won her seat, the member for Grey won his seat and the member for O'Connor won his seat. These members of parliament are very vocal. Their support of the cashless debit card is known very strongly and widely across the community, and they all won their seats. There wasn't some big turnaround in those communities. Is there anyone on the other side who has the guts to stand up to their colleagues to protect Australians living in these communities? We need to help Australians living in these communities, not abandon them. This is just another example of the Labor Party abandoning those living in vulnerable and remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the use of drugs and excessive alcohol drives up rates of domestic violence and abuse, particularly against women and children living in these communities. Who on the other side is going to stand up for these women and children? We must listen to those who live in these communities who want to have the card, who have told us repeatedly that there are benefits to the cashless debit card, that there are better outcomes as a result.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a tremendous amount of respect for Noel Pearson, the founder and director of the Cape York Institute. At the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee into this legislation he shared powerful stories about his work for more than 20 years to help his community through income management, with the cashless debit card being the only technical solution that exists right at this moment. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This week we met with the minister. I spoke in no uncertain terms, like I'm speaking to the committee, that our work in Cape York will be severely kiboshed if we don't have a card facility attached to the FRC. It's crucial. You can't consider going back to the BasicsCard. It is a very inconvenient card. It doesn't have the functionality of the CDC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party have deliberately demonised the cashless debit card for the sake of their own political pointscoring. Running their lies about the coalition putting pensioners onto the cashless debit card in the lead-up to the federal election in May is the genesis of this problem we've got. Why did they do this? Why are they now abolishing the cashless debit card when all the evidence is that it is actually working? They've painted themselves into a corner. In order to maximise the political advantage of the atrocious scare campaign they ran ahead of the election, they were put into a corner where they had to say, 'What are you going to do about the cashless debit card?' In a flurry, they said, 'We'll get rid of it,' and they've painted themselves into a corner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are amendments that have been distributed in the chamber. Their amendments and the funding for services that will be required to overcome the result of the abolition are proof that this government is actually lost at sea. In a flurry they made this decision to abolish the cashless debit card, and now they, very quickly, right here before us, are turning it around. There are some amendments here that are going to keep what they're calling an 'enhanced card'—and I'll come to that in a moment. So even now, months after the federal election, they continue to spout lies and untruths about how the cashless debit card does not work while choosing to consign welfare recipients in the Northern Territory back on to the clunky and outdated BasicsCard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the Labor Party have managed to do is demonise a method of income management that gives people the choice and the freedom to choose to spend their money wherever and however they want while still protecting their communities from lawless and antisocial behaviour stemming from drug and alcohol abuse. What we are seeing with the government amendments that have been circulated is that this lot over here have realised that they have painted themselves into a corner and that they are going to be putting people on to an 'enhanced card'. It says in here that they're going to put people on to a BasicsCard bank account. Now listen to this carefully, those in the back offices: I'm going to be asking some questions about this tomorrow when we get to the committee stage, so you make sure you come with information about what that actually means.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time I checked, the Australian government and Services Australia were not deposit-taking institutions. Now that's a technical term. It's listed in legislation that the only organisations that can hold money on behalf of other Australians, on behalf of citizens, is a deposit-taking institution—that is, a bank. The Australian government can't do that; it's not a deposit-taking institution. Now unless you're going to be nationalising a bank, you're going to spend millions and millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars on becoming a deposit-taking institution because you have to build all of the infrastructure and the services that go with it. If you're not going to do that, and I can't imagine you would because it would just be ridiculous, then you're going to have to outsource it. Who are you going to outsource it to? I bet it will be the same provider that's already providing the cashless debit card. You're just rebadging it. You're just renaming it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why don't you come in here and be upfront with the Australian people about what you're actually going to be doing, because you've misled the Australian people. Right through your election campaign you say you're going to abolish the cashless debit card. But guess what? Right here, in this amendment, it says that you're going to put them on an enhanced contemporary card. 'A contemporary card'. Well you've just belled the cat because we know exactly what you're going to do, you're just renaming the cashless debit card. I wonder if people are going to have to change their accounts. Will they be able to stay with their current accounts? I bet you they will because it's exactly what's happening. They probably won't have to change their account, anyone who wants to voluntarily stay on it, anyone who's in the Northern Territory, anyone who's up in Cape York. Be upfront: have the guts to come in here, stand up and explain to the Australian people what you're actually doing. You've belled the cat. Be under no illusion: this so-called enhanced card is just the cashless debit card rebadged. Come on, fess up to the Australian people. You've bitten off more than you can chew and, now that you know how it works, you've come around. But rather than fess up, you think you can just rename it and get away with it. Well shame on you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CDC functions like the millions of debit cards in circulation in Australia at this very moment. It can be used to make purchases anywhere where Visa or EFTPOS are accepted. By running on the Visa platform, the card has moved with payment developments and is widely accepted by merchants. It can be used on phones, through Apple Pay, Google Pay, and for online purchases. The CDC—it is the enhanced card that the government's amendments describe. All they're doing is renaming it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the two minutes I have left, I just want to give you some feedback from those who are on the ground, who have firsthand experience with the cashless debit card. Firstly, from my very good friend—and I think one of the most trusted Australians—Mr Ian Trust from Kununurra. He spoke about lifting people from entrenched disadvantage with the help of the cashless debit card. He said, 'I'd say the biggest contribution from the cashless debit card was probably a reduction in the harassment of vulnerable people, many elders, by their relatives, grandkids and children and so on for their money.' He's someone on the ground who gets it, not some academic from Sydney or Melbourne, not some bureaucrat or a bunch of politicians that don't really live it, don't really walk it. This is someone who lives in his community. He was one of the ones that called for it in the first place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the witnesses that we had before the committee advocated for more services and seeing support put around people. We heard from those in the Goldfields that, just this year alone, 70 people have moved off welfare and into a job. Due to the investment that we put into this community when we were in government, 70 people have moved off welfare and into a job.</span>

I've forgotten more than most people would actually know about this sort of stuff, particularly when it comes to training and employment. I can tell you that to get that sort of result is outstanding. That is outstanding. I want to finish with this quote in the 30 seconds I've got left:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Infrastructure and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:51</span>):  I think that contribution right there really belled the cat. In fact, what it said to me was that this is an opposition that has no policies, and it's an opposition for opposition's sake. This is a bill that delivers on the Albanese government's election commitment to abolish the cashless debit card. It is a position that we took to the election. What happened on 21 May is that we had a change of government. People voted for a change. That's what happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of other things happened. A familiar theme has been flowing through the contributions by the opposition: we never listen; then, when we make amendments because we listened to the Senate inquiry into this bill, somehow that is wrong too. You never can get it right with this lot. You can never get it right with this lot. Regardless of what they want to tell you, and regardless of what they say in their contributions, this commitment was made following extensive consultations with individuals, with organisations, with service providers and with cashless debit card holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been numerous evaluations, inquiries and orders, none of which have been able to establish that the card is working. The latest of these was the ANAO report released in June, which highlighted the lack of evidence to demonstrate any success associated with the rollout of the card. Instead, what we've heard are the experiences of cardholders feeling stigmatised and believing that they're being punished for being welfare recipients. That is why Labor committed to abolishing the card. That is part of why the Australian people voted for the Labor Party—our commitment to abolish the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of this bill will mean that no new social security recipients can be put on the card. It will also enable the more than 17,000 current cardholders to transition away from having to use the card as part of this process. Everyone who is currently using the card will be able to remain on voluntary income management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill revealed how poorly targeted the rollout of the cashless debit card was. According to UnitingCare Australia, most of the people on the cashless debit card do not have substance abuse or gambling problems, despite the previous government's claim that the rollout of the card would target welfare recipients experiencing those very issues. UnitingCare went on to say that the numerous evaluations and studies conducted since the card was first introduced in 2016 had provided 'no evidence that the groups of people singled out and put on the card were in fact the people facing the highest risk of engaging in the behaviours that it was meant to target'. This is not new. This is not news to anyone. The coalition government had the same information to hand back then but they continued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month there were over 17,000 of our fellow Australians on the cashless debit card. People aged 35 and under who receive the JobSeeker payment, youth allowance, parenting allowance and are in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay are required to use the card. All recipients of working age payments in Ceduna, the Goldfields and East Kimberley are required to use the card. Some income support recipients in Cape York and some income management participants in the Northern Territory are also required to use the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current program relies on visa debit cards that have been issued by the payment company Indue or the Traditional Credit Union in the Northern Territory. One of the many problems is that these cards can only be used in stores that accept the cards. That lack of widespread acceptance of the card, and the workarounds developed by some community members and businesses, has led to increased hardship. In some cases rent payments have been blocked, making housing stability an additional challenge for those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard, in a number of contributions here, about the issues that related to the use of the card and the extra hardship that it caused people who were required to use these cards. Anyone in this chamber should have a good long, hard look at themselves as to suggest that people should be not be able to shop where they want to shop. When you're putting these systems in place you need to have a good, long, hard look at yourself. I mean, seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government also claimed that this form of compulsory income management would help women in violent and abusive relationships, but, again, there is no evidence to support this claim—no evidence at all—and no-one, in all the contributions that we've had here today, has put forward any evidence to support this claim. If this is your position, if your position is to oppose this piece of legislation, you should be putting forward the evidence—not just blanket statements, but real evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their submission to the committee inquiry the Top End Women's Legal Service outlined some of the complexity faced by women survivors and victims of violence and abuse, including the shame of providing details to Centrelink and the problems accessing housing and crisis support when on the BasicsCard and cashless debit card—so the opposite of what you're saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The St Vincent de Paul Society shares the view of many that there's no evidence that compulsory income management has any widespread or sustained benefits. They were also concerned that the use of the cashless debit card did not lead to any discernible improvements in employment outcomes. Instead, it often resulted in stigmatisation, exclusion, financial hardship and discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill allows for a staged transition for people who currently use the card. This gradual process will allow Services Australia to conduct individual interviews with everyone subjected to the cashless card, to ensure that each participant is well informed of their options and the support services that are available to them. The approach taken by this government is sensible. It's a government that cares about people. It's incumbent upon the opposition to come out in their contributions and put out cold, hard facts. Quite frankly, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen any facts to support the statements they are presenting to this chamber. They need to take a good, hard look at themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This approach the government is taking is supported by the evidence from service providers that the most effective way to achieve long-term sustainable change is to provide individualised, culturally sensitive services and support for as long as they are required. When this bill is passed, anyone who wishes to cease using the card will be able to do so without having to prove anything to any government agency. They will no longer have to share some very detailed private information in order to be moved off the card. The gradual transition proposed by the government will also allow for further meaningful consultations with First Nations people and their representative organisations on the specific challenges faced by their communities. These consultations will explore the types of supports that will benefit these communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Welfare payments and associated supports are key components to delivering on this government's priority that no-one is left behind. A priority for the government will be to ensure that every measure we put in place to assist some of our most vulnerable citizens does just that—assists them. We will always have supporting the most vulnerable members of our community as our top priority. The delivery of housing, health, education, child care and income support will make Australia a better place. These important areas of public policy are key to delivering on this government's top two priorities—no-one left behind and no-one held back. Today we are taking a step forward on that journey. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

The question is going to be: what actually happens on the ground when the cashless debit card is removed? Notwithstanding all Senator Brown's fine words and those given by an array of speakers opposite, and from the Greens and others, regarding the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022, I genuinely fear that in practice the removal of this cashless debit card will be an absolute unmitigated disaster for some of our most vulnerable people in Australia.

In each of the four federal seats where the cashless debit card has been in place, a coalition member of parliament was returned: in the seat of Hinkler, which includes Hervey Bay, where the cashless debit card is in place, the federal coalition member was returned; in the seat of Grey, which includes Ceduna, where the cashless debit card is in place, the federal coalition member was returned; in the seat of Durack, which contains Kalgoorlie, the federal coalition member was returned; and in the seat of O'Connor, including the Goldfields, the federal coalition member was returned. That is four out of four. Where is your mandate from the actual communities where the cashless debit card is in place? There is no mandate from those communities; it is from others who are far removed from what is happening on the ground in the communities most impacted. There is no mandate from the communities where the cashless debit card is in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And in terms of one of those seats, held by my good friend, Keith Pitt MP, in the federal seat of Hinkler, I just want to quote some of his words from his speech. We might disagree in this place about philosophy, ideology or approaches to issues, but I would hope that no-one in this place could in any way impugn the sincerity of Mr Keith Pitt MP, the member for Hinkler, who cares deeply about his community, which has the cashless debit card at the moment. He was returned. He has a mandate to fight for the retention of the cashless debit card. This is what he said in the other place on Tuesday 2 August 2022:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There were some 6,552 individuals on the card at this site as of 1 July 2022 and it's making a difference—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's evidence. That's the local member who is closest to his own community. That is evidence. He's talking to people on the ground every day—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">it is making a big difference. My site is significantly different to the other three. We do not have a majority of Indigenous or Aboriginal descent in my patch. It is only on four payments: Newstart, youth allowance (other), parenting payment single and parenting payment partnered. That is all. It has worked, and that is being demonstrated by the evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And he goes on and he talks about why he's so passionate about the card in Hervey Bay. When it was introduced, or prior to its introduction:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it was projected that without any intervention, 57 per cent of those under 30 on welfare would still be on income support in 10 years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's someone who's concerned about young people in his own electorate who are facing that future of continued dependence on welfare. That was his concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did he say in terms of those opposite?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But here is what we have seen from those opposite. They said they would consult. We did over 100 meetings for consultation in my electorate, but they went and talked to some activists who don't live in the area—in fact, they're not in the electorate of Hinkler—who are opposed because, well, they're activists, and that's no real surprise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's Keith Pitt MP, my good friend, the member for Hinkler, genuinely concerned about his community and genuinely concerned about the impact of removal of the cashless debit card upon his community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the coalition senators who were involved in writing the dissenting report in relation to the removal of the cashless debit card, and there are a few points I'd like to make from their dissenting report. The first is it should be noted that the CDC program commenced in Ceduna, South Australia, on 15 March 2016, and has been in East Kimberly, Western Australia, since 26 April 2016. It was progressively rolled out in the Goldfields in Western Australia since 26 March 2018, and introduced in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions, represented by my good friend Keith Pitt MP since 29 January 2019. And I should say, in terms of the introduction of the card in Hervey Bay, I gave a speech in this place, probably about 24 months ago, where I talked about how the youth unemployment rate in Hervey Bay actually fell by an extraordinary rate after the introduction of the cashless debit card. It fell by an extraordinary rate compared to the rest of Queensland. It was also introduced in the Cape York region in Queensland, and in the Northern Territory in early 2020. As at 5 August 2022, there were 17,754 participants using the cashless debit card around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why was it introduced? What was the intention behind the introduction? A lot of things have been said about the intention, all of which have been from those opposite, all of which have misrepresented the intention. The intention has always been to help people. You might disagree with the philosophy of the policy and you might disagree with its practical outcomes, but no-one can legitimately disagree with the intention, which has been to help some of our most vulnerable people make a transition from welfare to leading lives where they can have jobs and provide for their families. I quote from the dissenting report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CDC program was sparked by the heartbreaking report of the 'sleeping rough inquest' into the deaths of six people in South Australia's far west coast, handed down by the state's coroner in 2011. It found that efforts to curb alcohol abuse in the region had not been successful and that it was having devastating impacts on individuals and families and their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Cashless Debit Card program was designed to be a tool that could assist communities in addressing social harm issues such as domestic violence, child neglect and other antisocial behaviours that arose from alcohol and substance addiction and long-term welfare dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Indigenous community leaders approached the government for support and worked with government to establish the CDC program. The further rollout was established on the same basis—that being community support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the reality. That's what led to the introduction of this scheme in the first place. What is going to happen in those areas when this card is removed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what do the people closest to the community say? They're the people we should be listening to. It's their voices we should be listening to in terms of this debate. Noel Pearson, founder and director of strategy at the Cape York Partnership—an outstanding Queenslander—said, 'I think this legislation will wipe out 20 years of my work.' Is he wrong? Is Noel Pearson wrong? Is that evidence? It's pretty persuasive evidence to me—testimony from someone who has a close connection with this community, and who is an expert with respect to these matters. Is that evidence? It's pretty persuasive evidence to me. This is what he says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in the absence of a solution that had the same functionality as the cashless debit card, our Family Responsibilities Commission and the welfare reform work that we've done via that over the last 20 years will collapse, and that would be a very bad thing. We'd just have to give up. We would come to the point of just giving up on the idea that we can change anything for the future of these communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's from Noel Pearson. No one cares more about those Cape York communities than Noel Pearson, and this is his testimony. That's evidence, and persuasive evidence at that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder state in its submission? It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to abolish the CDC has been made without any consultation with the regional community and the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder remains unconsulted on how the transition will impact CDC participants, social services providers, government agencies, and the community.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what they say in Kalgoorlie, one of the communities most impacted. What does the mayor of the District Council of Ceduna say? Mayor Perry Will says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've had no consultation about it at all. The first we heard of it was in the PM's election promises, that he was going to do it. Prior to that, we had had no representation from any Labor politicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former mayor, Mr Allan Suter OAM, was the same, and stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I might also add that Minister Rishworth was encouraged twice by a local member of parliament to contact me, because of my knowledge of the card, when she visited Ceduna, but, despite heavy prompting from our local member, no effort was made to contact me. I made sure I was available if the phone rang, and it didn't.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll see the evidence of what happens when these trials come to an end. We'll see the evidence then, and those who support the abolition of the CDC will be responsible for those outcomes. It will be your responsibility, and every fine paragraph of oratory in this place will not make a damn difference to the people on the ground in those communities. It won't make a damn difference to any of them. It will just be fine words spoken in this place, but it'll mean nothing to their on-the-ground experiences.</span>

They do not have that mandate. Four out of four of those seats returned coalition members of parliament who fought the last election on retention of the cashless debit card. The communities most impacted by the cashless debit card voted for its retention, and those opposite need to soberly consider that fact, and it is a fact, just as we all will be forced to soberly consider the consequences, and I fear they will be disastrous for some of these local communities. All of us will need to soberly consider the consequences of the abolition of the cashless debit card.</span>

                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022, which has a long title. Essentially, it's a simple bill that seeks to deliver on a commitment to abolish the cashless debit card. When I first came to this place, I had the good for fortune to be asked to serve on the Senate Standing Committees on Finance and Public Administration and that meant that I was deeply involved in a number of inquiries into matters which affected First Nations people. At the time I was on the committee, it inquired into the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, it inquired into the Community Development Program and it inquired into the legal services that were available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who required services because they were facing legal proceedings of some kind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A common theme flowed through the government's approach to all of these inquiries. The last government's approach to policy making in relation to First Nations people was almost entirely devoid of input from First Nations people. It was an approach that proceeded with a set of ideas about what would be good for community; it was not an approach that sought to engage community in the design or the delivery of programs that were inflicted upon them. The results were very clear in each of the programs that we examined in these communities. It is a deeply flawed way of dealing with communities that continue to suffer very significant impacts arising from a legacy of colonisation. However well-intentioned those were who sought to design and implement these programs, they were unable to understand that, unless we involve community in the process of building programs, these programs would not be successful, and that inability to understand then flawed almost every measure that was implemented by our predecessors, who now sit on the other side of the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us seeks to remedy yet another one of these failed interventions. The cashless debit card was introduced as a trial. The government at the time said that this was something they wanted to try with communities and they built an evidence base to evaluate whether or not it was a program that was in fact working. But, like so many of these interventions, firstly, the people who were subjected to this trial were not really adequately consulted at all and, secondly, the trial was not constructed in a way that would yield an evidence base that would support a decision to continue or discontinue the program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evaluation conducted by ORIMA into the effectiveness of the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley was utterly inconclusive at best, a point made by the ANAO when they reviewed it. There was insufficient credible evidence at that point to support the establishment of further trials. Despite that, the government relied on that evaluation to roll out more and more trials of the card. At the time, Janet Hunt, who was the deputy director of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the ANU, said that the evaluation showed the cashless debit card had not improved safety and reduced violence, despite that being one of the trial's key objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANAO report into the implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial in 2018 uncovered some very serious issues, including false reporting of data collected through the trials. The evaluation noted a decrease in ambulance call-outs when in fact there had been an increase. The evaluation also said there was an increase in school attendance, but the ANAO found Indigenous school attendance had decreased after the introduction of the card. The Auditor-General's report on the trials also raised very real and serious questions about the cost of the program, including the high cost of the trials, budget overruns and flawed procurement processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems a long time ago now, 2018, but, despite all of this information, the government persisted with an approach that, at the very best, you could say didn't have any evidence to support it, and, at the very worst, you could see there was evidence to suggest that it was not working at all. This is basically the problem. Communities were not involved, the evidence didn't suggest it was working, but those opposite pushed ahead. The program unfairly targeted Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people from low socioeconomic areas. The evidence that keeps getting brought back to the parliament over and over again refers to the same kind of language. It talks about stigma, it talks about humiliation, it talks about having agency taken away from people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These kinds of reports should give policymakers pause. It's unlikely that programs that make people feel this way are going to have an effective or positive social benefit. It's surprising to me, even now, that our predecessors in the LNP were not inclined to listen to those voices when they repeatedly came before government and said over and over again that these kinds of measures are harmful to us and harmful to our people, harmful to our sense of self, discriminatory and stigmatising. It's an important reminder to us in this place why a Voice to Parliament is so critical and overdue. If we want to close the gap and engage with First Nations communities, then solutions and policy need to be genuinely community driven—not top down, not imposed. It's on this basis that I support the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LIDDLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. Well, what a backflip by this Labor government. What a proverbial dog's breakfast. We heard from a Labor senator today—clearly with more than a glance at the issues confronting those who live with addiction—that he didn't want an end to the CDC, because he's seen and heard there has been change. He will vote with his own party. What a brave, honourable senator. It was refreshing to hear earlier today that it is not perfect income management, but it is part of a strategy to provide some stability to the lives of the most vulnerable in the most vulnerable communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When in government for two terms, your former Labor minister and minister for Indigenous affairs, Jenny Macklin, whose advice we learned today you still value, was a fierce advocate of income management. Let me refresh your memory. I quote from an ABC interview in 2010: 'There's less harassment for money, less money spent on alcohol and gambling, and more money for food and for their children.' Even Graham Richardson, a stalwart Labor person, said in the news media only this month: 'I think it's had a very positive effect and I think we'd be crazy to dump it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I quote directly from the University of Adelaide's report, an independent academic evaluation released in 2021. It reported that the cashless debit card had helped recipients improve their lives and the lives of their families and other community members. The findings included that 25 per cent of people reported they are drinking less since the cashless debit card's introduction; 21 per cent of cashless debit card participants reported gambling less, and evidence found that the cash previously used for gambling had been redirected to essentials such as food; and 45 per cent of cashless card participants reported the cashless debit card had improved things for them and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been botched, and there's nothing here to celebrate. First responders, the police, the paramedics and the women's and men's shelters, those people who attend the carnage from addiction every single day, know what is coming. There is no stigmatising, because the evidence is right there. I dare you to stay around long enough when there's a battle going on between a couple, one wanting money from the other. What they don't know is that the war for them has not even really begun.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANAO report of 2022 is another professional report. It mostly looked at administration. In it there is no recommendation to end the CDC. In fact, there is nothing in that entire 83-page report that smells of scandal or incompetence in service delivery, nor is there anything that suggests it is such a failure it needs to be dismantled. It does not say it does not work. In fact, earlier Auditor-General's reports in 2018 and 2019 said that it was difficult to conclude whether the CDC trial was effective in achieving its objective of reducing social harm. It's about the data. It's about the baseline. As politicians, our job is to make Australia a better place, to fix things. This legislation will make a bad situation much worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to talk about consultation—or, rather, lack of it—in this decision. It's not consultation. As a senator for South Australia, I visited the community of Ceduna very recently. I've been there a number of times over the years. I walked the streets with Julian Leeser, shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. We went into a gaming room and one of the local bars. People knew we were there, and they were pleased to stop and talk to us. I don't know who you were talking to, but these were not scripted discussions with specially selected people. These were complete randoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What they told us, we already knew. These CDC sites were trials. They were not perfect. They felt comfortable telling us they were on the card. They didn't like it, but they needed it to restrict the good times and to ensure their families were okay. I'll translate that. Yes, they didn't like it, but it was an important safeguard for them and their families. These conversations happened in the street, in the bar and in the gaming room.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the words of Mayor Perry Will from the District Council of Ceduna:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've had no consultation about it at all. The first we heard of it was in the PM's election promises, that he was going to do it. Prior to that, we had had no representation from any Labor politicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, there was no recent consultation with him. Former Mayor Allan Suter OAM said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I might also add that Minister Rishworth was encouraged twice by a local member of parliament to contact me, because of my knowledge of the card, when she visited Ceduna, but, despite heavy prompting from our local member, no effort was made to contact me. I made sure I was available if the phone rang, and it didn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not an education campaign, less than a few weeks out from the changes you propose. Time is important to allow those on the card to have conversations with their families on decisions on remaining on the card. It is unbelievable that you would think that it was unacceptable or unreasonable to allow time for those discussions. That is also what free, prior and informed consent is about. It's about giving people the information they need so that they understand it in a timely manner and so that they can have those important conversations to reduce the backlash that might come their way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these people have English as a second or third language. These are smart people. They should have been properly consulted. Even worse, I don't think I've seen, in all the material I've read, anything that looks even remotely like a social impact statement—a social risk assessment. Sure, the Senate committee looked at it, but we've also heard that it was rushed and it prevented many people from being included. I would have thought that, at the very minimum, if you were going to take apart a program that had been in place for so long, you would have done a proper, rigorous, independent risk assessment. Your decision should have been informed by the most recent data. We now, however, have a baseline, and from that you should be monitoring hospitalisations, incarcerations and child protection notifications from the date of the end of the card. Are you even planning to do that? Or has that just been conveniently forgotten? We won't forget those people who have been affected by the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard time and time again that it is about delivering on an election promise. Are you serious? There are 151 electorates in this country, yet only seven of them are in areas where the CDC currently exists. That's hardly a mandate, if that is what you're suggesting. If those who are on the card want an alcoholic drink or want to have a flutter or to play the pokies, I will celebrate and join in with them. In fact, they probably have enough cash that they can shout me, too. We could have a good time. They have cash available to them. There's a component that's quarantined, and there's also a cash component—discretionary; they can spend that at the local fete or they can choose to spend it on a drink, on the pokies or on anything else they want to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about living with addiction, binge drinking, drug abuse or gambling and providing some protection from the consequences of those things for those who need it most to protect themselves and others. I've heard directly from the people at the Sobering Up Centre in Ceduna that a blood alcohol level of—wait for it—0.02 is pretty matter of fact. I read the coronial report that led to Ceduna being established as a CDC location, and it refers at one point to regular levels being 0.02. But wait for this: it even refers to a 0.4—yes, a 0.4. I've heard medical people say, 'That's ridiculous; you should be legally dead.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people walk around every day with these blood alcohol levels, and their bodies are ravaged by it. Their families are ravaged by it. They are completely ravaged by it. Their communities are ravaged by it, and the non-Aboriginal people in those communities are ravaged by it. Nobody wants to live like that. You should see the coronials: cirrhosis, bleeding of the liver—it goes on and on. The age of death is much lower than what you or I will expect to reach. That's the reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Flip-flopping and confusion by this government at the eleventh hour only adds to confusion for those who are currently on the card and already disadvantaged, mostly in education and employment and even in communication. You are not getting rid of income management in the Northern Territory; you are simply referring people to an inferior card with inferior technology while you work out the other bits—the technology. Well, when you live in a regional and remote area, communication is always a challenge. So, going into the Christmas period coming up, wondering if the technology is going to work and not even knowing what card you're going to be on or how that transition might happen, is terrifying for these people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CDC is an advanced technology that enables recipients to access their welfare payments by using the universal banking system. The BasicsCard is a limited delivery mechanism. In fact, when I learnt of the benefits of the CDC as opposed to the BasicsCard a few years ago, I encouraged people to change over. I was absolutely gutted by what people were telling me. They had heard from mischievous people hellbent on progressing their philosophical agenda of all sorts of evils. It was ridiculous, the stories I heard—cruel even.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You know there is a terrible time ahead, and not just for individuals with addiction, their families and their communities—yes, even the non-Aboriginal residents—because you have provided $50 million for additional drug and alcohol support services. Is that for one year? Before you say it's good, is that for one year or is that for every year for the next few years? How many years is that for? It's light on detail yet again. What about the other services, such as domestic and family violence services or financial counselling? We're not very far out from the end of this card, and you still haven't explained it to the people who rely on those services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drug and alcohol and gambling addiction is about losing control and doing things to harmful levels because you simply can't stop on your own. You might take several attempts to actually get help, even if you know it's available to you. It takes at least three times for a person with addiction to be successful in conquering it. That's a lot of time for people who rely on not having a drunk come home, on not having an abusive person come home or on not having food taken from them to wait while the card is fixed or while that person gets help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changing the CDC to a voluntary card will make the most vulnerable in our communities more vulnerable. I have said it before, I will say it again and I will keep saying it. Whether you are living with or love those with an addiction, a frontline worker, a member of the public or the family or generation left to deal with the chaos and grief, there is no escaping the consequences of addiction and substance misuse, or the coercion and control that often follows. Addressing it benefits us all. In removing the CDC you have failed to respond to that. Your abandonment of the most vulnerable is a disgrace, and the way you are going about this transition is irresponsible and reckless. Delay it, like you're going to delay the other card, to reduce further damage and disruption at the worst possible time on the calendar year for those people it is going to affect the most.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">ISHOLM</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Education, Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:38</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022. This legislation will go towards delivering on the federal Labor government's commitment to the Australian people to abolish the cashless debit card. In my contribution today I am going to focus my remarks on my experiences in Queensland, particularly in Hinkler and also from the time I have spent in the cape. The commitment that federal Labor made around this before the election is something that I personally made many times in the electorate of Hinkler. It's something that I know was an important factor for us to be upfront with the Australian people about, and it is something we took to the election. There is no doubt what the federal Labor position was before that election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the previous term of parliament I spent a vast amount of time in the Hinkler electorate—in Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and surrounding communities—because I am the duty senator for that area. So it is something I have experience of, having met with constituents who have been impacted by the card. It is something that has stayed with me as the Queensland senator, as I experienced those constituent issues firsthand. Part of the reason I experienced those issues is that their local member, the member for Hinkler, actually refused to meet with constituents who were impacted by this. So it fell on me as the duty senator to pick up some of that slack that you would normally expect of a dutiful federal member of parliament as a basic function of their office and being elected—that they would look after those constituents or at least listen to them and help them out. But we didn't see that in Bundaberg. They were ignored by their local members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you did go to those communities and listen, you were impacted by the stories you heard from people who were put on that card, and it was those personal stories that had a real impact on me. It was the mum who couldn't take her kids to the school fete because the card couldn't be used there; she didn't have the cash to do it. It was the young mum buying groceries in the local supermarket; a couple of blokes saw that she was paying with a cashless debit card and commented, 'She's one of those druggies, because she's using that card.' It was the lack of wraparound services that these people were impacted by, that were promised but took too long to deliver. It's clear to me, having spent time in that community, how divisive this card was, the stigma that was associated with it and the impact it had on those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My office dealt with numerous constituent issues, over the course of the last few years, whilst this card was being implemented. We did our best to help, but the draconian nature of this card didn't always make it possible. There are also the practical things: the fact that a place like Bundaberg produces so much great, fresh produce—they have burgeoning farmers markets—yet people on the cashless debit card can't go and use it there; they're restricted in where they can use their card. It's practical things like that, that would enable people to live a better life and use fresh produce, that they weren't able to do. There was the issue at our office of people defaulting on their rent because of bureaucratic errors in the way the card was administered. There are so many issues with this card—and this is just in my experience in Hinkler—that had a negative impact on the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one constant theme was that there was no consultation before this card was implemented. In my contribution I want to dispel the myth, once and for all, that there has been no consultation on this legislation. We're not going to get lectured to by those opposite about consultation, given what they did to the electorate of Hinkler, given they came in from on high and implemented this legislation. They didn't consult with anyone in Hinkler before they did it; they just put everyone on it and said, 'This is the way it will be.' Then you add to that a local member, Keith Pitt, the member for Hinkler, who wouldn't meet with constituents who raised issues about this card, who had problems with this card. So there was no consultation before they did it, and then you had a local member who was so arrogant that he wouldn't meet with constituents who had valid concerns about this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard numerous times from those opposite, in their contributions on this bill, that Labor haven't consulted. I know they're new to opposition but that's actually what a good opposition does: they go out and consult. And that's what we did. I went with the then shadow minister, Linda Burney, through Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. We met with local constituents. We did round tables. We did forums. We heard from people. That's how you form a view in opposition about what you want to do in government. That's something they could learn but they show no willingness to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even since we formed government, the now minister, Amanda Rishworth, has been out and consulted, along with the assistant minister, Justine Elliot, with every community impacted by this card. So to claim that there's been no consultation is absolute nonsense, and we are certainly not going to be lectured to about consultation when they did none of it in Hinkler before the election. Let's dispel that myth once and for all. We are not going to be lectured to by these guys about consultation. We have done the consultation. That's what a good opposition does. We did it when we were in opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, when you come to power, when you come to government, you go about implementing your promises, which is what we've done, but we also had the minister and assistant minister visit these communities. We also had the Senate committee process, led by Senator Marielle Smith, do a really good job as well of going around and listening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said I'd make my contribution focused on Queensland, because that's my experience. But I have seen the contribution from my colleagues in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. They have done their job as Labor senators and gone about consulting their communities over the last couple of years as well. So this 'lack of consultation' myth can be completely dispelled. It is nonsense, and it is disappointing that the opposition continue to try to raise it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government first announced the card, they promised there would be an investment in wraparound services as well, and I know from my own experience in Hinkler that this took more than two years to be implemented. The card was being rolled out, yet the additional wraparound services that were promised in a much-needed area of the community took two years, and they got delivered only when there was a bit of public pressure and a bit of media pressure and when the local community said, 'Where are these additional services?' We see they wasted $170 million on this, but they didn't provide the services that were there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the Senate inquiry heard from many people impacted by the card, and many spoke about that lack of consultation that I experienced firsthand through my work as a senator. I know Kathryn Wilkes very well from the time I spent in both Bundaberg and Hinkler. She is someone who has been a good advocate for her community. Kathryn said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People for whom it turned up in the letterbox and they didn't have any idea what was going on. No consultation. No, 'Would you like it?' Bang, you're on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a very common theme as well, from what I heard from people in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the time of the card, we saw multiple attempts to change the goalposts to justify the trial as a success. First it was about how it would increase employment in the area. At the time, there were no significant differences between Bundaberg and Hervey Bay and the neighbouring areas of Gympie and Maryborough, which weren't on the card, so, when you actually compared the criteria they were trying to set, there were no differences across the geographic boundaries in the area. They then shifted the goalposts to talk about crime and social impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government again struggled to find any evidence to say that this was a fact, and, after a $2 million study into the cards by the University of Adelaide, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> reported in February 2021 that the cashless debit card review had failed to find proof that the coalition welfare scheme reduced social harm. So even their own report into this, which they commissioned, failed to provide the evidence that it was working. Then the ANAO audit into the performance of the cashless debit card again found that there was a lack of evidence to demonstrate the success of the card. There were no key performance indicators and no evidence or evaluation conducted to support the former government's scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the evidence the card wasn't working, the government continued to pursue it, forcing more people onto the card, and it began to look at expanding it further. That is why this government is acting. We're out there. We're listening to constituents, we're listening to local communities and we've heard stories from those people who want the card scrapped. We've heard from organisations that have long maintained that the card is punitive and doesn't work. We have also seen the evidence that this card doesn't work. We said we would repeal it as a priority, and that is exactly what is happening now we are in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve a government that doesn't take them for granted—one that delivers on investment into regional areas to create jobs and opportunities. As we make the transition away from the cashless debit card, this bill will ensure that it will be as smooth as can be and that the communities will have access to the support they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will remove the ability for any new entrants to be put on the card. It will enable more than 70,000 existing cashless debit card participants to be progressively transitioned off the card as soon as the bill receives royal assent, which we aim to have occur in the next sitting period, in October, allowing participants to regain the financial freedom that they've been asking for and enabling the Family Responsibilities Commission to continue to support community members by placing them into income management where the need exists. That is not something that is new for those Cape communities; income management has been a factor there now for a long time. This will allow for the determination, following consultation, of how the Northern Territory participants on the CDC will transition and of the income management arrangements that will exist. Finally, it will allow for the repeal of the cashless debit card on a date to be fixed by proclamation or, at a maximum, six months after royal assent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we need to continue to support communities, and we will continue to support these communities as they transition off the cashless debit card. The government's vision is that no-one will be left behind and no-one will be held back. We will make sure that all those in our society are supported and have the opportunity to succeed. Repealing the cashless debit card helps to do that. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

They've shown, in their short time in government, that all they can do is make grandiose statements that sound nice on social media but do not actually make one bit of difference in people's lives. We saw this recently. During the entirety of the 46th Parliament they harped on about integrity, and, within the first couple of months of government, they've had multiple ministers breach their ministerial code of conduct. I'm amazed there's not one in here tonight! And how did the PM deal with this breach of ministerial standards? Nothing—he didn't do anything to deal with it. He simply swept it under the carpet.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we're seeing this pattern—of making statements but acting in another way—again, with the repeal of the cashless debit card. Despite all their talk about caring for our First Nations people, we see, with the legislation now before us, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022, that this is all hollow. The Albanese government's decision to abolish the cashless debit card has given the green light to more grog, drug abuse and violence in some of our most vulnerable communities, without ever studying any social impact of what might come out of this—without any evidence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You talk about the ANAO report, which clearly says that they can't tell whether it worked or not, because of the wraparound services that you were just alleging weren't provided. Now you're going to have to spend even more on those, because you can't even help people manage their own lives. It's all about grandiose statements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an innovative program, designed to tackle social harm—something the Labor Party should give a damn about. It was particularly associated with the harms around drug and alcohol addiction in communities with high rates of long-term social security dependence—not random communities here and there, not 'from my day or two in Hinkler', not 'from my little junket here and there', but based on evidence.</span>

If they listened to communities, those currently using the card, they would see how bad an idea it is to repeal this. Tammy Williams from the Family Responsibilities Commission said, 'The majority of people now using the CDC on Cape York are doing it on a voluntary basis.' I will repeat that: on a voluntary basis. Noel Pearson, the founder and director of the Cape York Partnership and one of Australia's leading lights said that this legislation will wipe out 20 years of his work.</span>

The first we heard was in the PM's election promises that he was going to do it. Prior to that we had no representation from any Labor politicians.' Must have been in Hinkler, Senator Chisholm—through, you, Madam Chair. If the government had any respect for the communities, as they constantly say they have, one would think that they would have spent some time talking to them to see how this legislation would affect their lives.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Chair. I would appreciate the silence, too. This truly worries me, because it is these communities that will be affected by the carelessness of those opposite. It also worries me because it looks like they're taking the same approach to their Voice to Parliament. They're asking Australians to make a change to our Constitution without providing us any detail of what those changes will be and without having any proper engagement or consultation. With such an important change, that would have far-reaching changes to the rest of society. If they approach the Voice to Parliament in a similar manner to which they have the cashless debit card, I fear that this government will implement changes that will hurt Australians even further.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government now clearly recognise they've made a terrible error with this bill. Their own amendments will allow Cape York, the CDC trial sites, and those in the NT who voluntary transitioned from the BasicsCard to the CDC, to remain on that card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">the removal of the cashless debit card… allowed countless families on welfare to feed their children rather than seeing the money claimed by kinship demand from alcoholics, substance abusers and gamblers in their own family group.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:58</span>):  The amendments proposed by the government to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022 will quite simply extend the cashless debit card. This goes against everything they said during the election campaign and shows this ill-conceived promise was made on the fly without proper consideration. This is yet another embarrassing backflip by the Albanese Labor government that ultimately means people in Cape York, the Northern Territory, and within the CDC trial sites who voluntarily transitioned from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card can now stay on the card. These amendments are an admission by Labor they got it wrong and that abolishing the cashless debit card will have dire consequences for those vulnerable communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased Labor have recognised their mistake in time and provisioned $50 million for additional drug and alcohol support services to reduce the serious social harm that is likely to result from the removal of this critical welfare program. Despite the amendments allowing people to voluntarily remain on the cashless debit card program and the additional funding for drug and alcohol support services, the intention of the bill is still to repeal the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Chair of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee during the 46th Parliament, I led the inquiry relating to the transition of income management participants in the Northern Territory and Cape York onto the cashless debit card from the BasicsCard during 2020. The understanding I have of this program means I know the difference the cashless debit card made in the trial communities. I heard women speaking about how they felt safer, better able to feed their families and more capable of helping their children participate in school since being part of this program. Labor's decision to abolish the cashless debit card would open up these vulnerable communities to more alcohol abuse, more drug abuse and more violence. I simply cannot endorse a bill that will impact the 17,000 participants in this way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also cannot support a bill that is being rushed. So little time has been spent considering what comes after the cashless debit card is repealed should this bill be successful, and that is distressing. During the federal election campaign Labor said it would abolish the card and leave no-one behind. However, forcing people who are used to using the system off the program with hardly any notice is not only poor planning but goes against the very reasoning it was set up in the first place. The act of abolishing the cashless debit card leaves behind thousands of people around the country. The government's amendments were induced today because, at the eleventh hour, Labor realised there was nothing suitable to replace the program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Income management has been used in Australia since 2007, and the technology that enabled an income management program to operate with EFTPOS transactions was introduced as the BasicsCard in 2008. While the BasicsCard technology made important inroads at the time of its introduction, its use is restricted. The BasicsCard can only be used in around 15,500 designated outlets, which must be all individually approved by government. But there is a better system, the cashless debit card. The CDC program was introduced in Ceduna, South Australia, in March 2016 and then progressively rolled out to the other trials between April 2016 and January 2019. There were 17,754 participants using the cashless debit card around Australia as of 5 August this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CDC program was developed following the sleeping rough inquest in 2011, where the state coroner inquired into the deaths of six people on South Australia's Far West coast. The coronial report found efforts to curb alcohol abuse in the region had been unsuccessful, and that had produced devastating impacts across those communities. The cashless debit card was designed to help these communities by addressing social harm issues like domestic violence, child neglect and antisocial behaviours that arose from alcohol and drug abuse and long-term welfare dependency. It must be said that Indigenous community leaders approached the government for support and worked with government to establish the CDC program. The further rollout of the program was established on the same basis of community support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Continuation of Cashless Welfare) Bill 2020 enabled income management recipients in the Northern Territory to voluntarily transition from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card. As of 5 August this year, 4,398 participants in the Northern Territory had voluntarily transitioned from the BasicsCard to the CDC. The cashless debit card can deliver income management technology and operates using existing banking infrastructure. Those who have a cashless debit card can use their card at around one million outlets that have EFTPOS facilities within Australia, making it far more accessible than the BasicsCard. It can also be used online and internationally. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the Cashless Debit Card program is part of a series of measures introduced by the coalition to help people improve their circumstances as well as to keep their community safe. Besides the card itself, these measures include the $30 million jobs fund and job ready initiative to strengthen local support services and help participants to upskill. There was also $50 million for residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities, as well as mental health services, extra family support services, targeted youth activities and financial counselling. Not only will such measures and support systems be under threat once the cashless debit card is repealed; it will leave more than 17,000 program participants in a worse position than when they started. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card operates as a Visa debit card, just like the debit cards you and I use at shops accepting Visa and EFTPOS. The only difference is that this card cannot be used to purchase alcohol or gambling products, and only a portion of payments can be withdrawn as cash. In most cases, 80 per cent of the recipient's support payment was quarantined on the cashless debit card with the remaining 20 per cent transferred to their personal bank account. In the Northern Territory the quarantined amount was just 50 per cent for most participants. For those in Cape York the quarantined percentage remained as it was under their previous income management arrangements. This strategy to reduce cash withdrawals also lessened the person's ability to spend their income support payments on illegal drugs. ORIMA Research published a report evaluating the CDC trial in 2017 showing a reduction in alcohol consumption, illegal drug use, and gambling. Other evaluations, including the University of Adelaide's 2021 report, have consistently shown this policy decreased drug and alcohol issues within the trial communities. It also decreased crime, violence and antisocial behaviour; improved child health and wellbeing; improved financial management; and strengthened the communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only weeks ago the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee heard from Noel Pearson, who founded the Cape York Institute. As we've heard previously, Mr Pearson spoke passionately about how the cashless debit card had positively influenced people in his community. It provided educational opportunities for families, like purchasing books, sporting equipment and school excursions. But he says this bill will wipe out 20 years of his work in the Cape York community. There has been discussion around quarantining income support payments and whether the government of the day should be able to stipulate how recipients spend such payments. Mr Pearson explained that quarantining money for essential purchases like rent and groceries gave those receiving income support payments the ability to save face when money was demanded of them. Instead of being forced to hand money over, recipients said, 'It's locked away; I can't give you the money.' Instead, the money fed, clothed and homed their families. The Cape York Institute worked with banks over many years to create a workable alternative, where money could be paid into a lockable or a pre-commitment account. But Mr Pearson told the committee no other option had been found. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in the absence of a solution that had the same functionality as the cashless debit card, our Family Responsibilities Commission and the welfare reform work that we've done via that over the last 20 years will collapse, and that would be a very bad thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her submission to the committee's hearing in Bundaberg, Commissioner Tammy Williams from Queensland's Family Responsibilities Commission asked for the card to stay. She requested that the Australian government retain the cashless debit card for FRC jurisdiction or, if replaced, that the alternative have at least the same functionality, as the FRC does not support the return of the BasicsCard, because it does not meet the standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Witnesses in Alice Springs spoke out about how the cashless debit card made a real difference in their communities. A financial counsellor with Central Australian Women's Legal Service told the committee that most of the women she worked with actually liked being on income management because they feel 'their children are being looked after because they're able to provide food and clothing', and 'they're not being harassed as much for money'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill is passed, will the Albanese Labor government take responsibility for the inevitable increase of violent crimes, alcohol and drug abuse, humbugging and child neglect that will follow? No, they will say they're leaving no-one behind, while walking away from the communities in Ceduna, East Kimberley, the Goldfields, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. But it's not just me saying this. Noel Pearson knows the impacts that tearing supports away from a community like Cape York will have. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You will repeal the card and then you will walk away and leave us to the violence, leave us to the hunger, leave us to the neglected children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was pulled together in a rush, without actually speaking with those who will be impacted. During the inquiry, the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder submitted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder remains unconsulted on how the transition will impact CDC participants, social services providers, government agencies, and the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ceduna mayor Perry Will said: 'We've had no consultation about it at all. The first we heard of it was in the PM's election promises'. But at the end of August Labor's hastily arranged CDC engagement team sent a raft of draft engagement documents to the Goldfields, with stakeholders given less than four days to provide feedback. They should have been consulted as soon as this election commitment was voiced or, ideally, as part of the policy development prior to announcing it. I wouldn't call this 'engagement'; I'd call it ticking a box so Labor can say that consultation occurred. Even the head of the Department of Social Services, the department which oversees this income management program, admitted the decision to abolish the card was an election commitment of the government. So the department would not have been involved in any consultation prior to the election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the other place, my coalition colleagues have already argued against the lack of planning that has gone into this bill and the repercussions that are sure to follow. The member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, whose electorate covers Ceduna, mentioned the positive differences the cashless debit card made in his community. He said that the people he'd spoken with were all horrified that the current government was going to stop the card. He shared the story of an elderly woman who was initially against the card's introduction but soon realised its value, as it was a buffer against the violence in her family and gave her the ability to stand up. Michael McCormack MP, the member for Riverina, pointed out that the biggest difference the cashless debit card had made was for children. If we, as the parliament of Australia, are to look after one thing—one sector of society—it should be our children. 'Children are our future,' he said. He is right. We must look after our children—our most vulnerable children—and this program did just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous Minister for Social Services, the member for Bradfield, Paul Fletcher, said the program 'has made a significant difference in the lives of thousands of people, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, in many communities around Australia'. He told members about how he was struck by senior Aboriginal women supporting the cashless debit card:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… because it meant that women could use social services payments for food, clothing and rent for themselves and their children, rather than being pressured by family members, typically male, to hand over cash to spend on nonessentials like alcohol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Police told Mr Fletcher the number of callouts relating to domestic violence had dramatically reduced, while medical clinic staff told him significantly fewer people were presenting as a result of domestic violence. A chemist said that parents were buying medicines for their children because they could now afford to. A social worker in that community told him that people were able to save money for the first time. Residents said they felt safer. Despite all this evidence, this government is insisting on forcing the bill through, and the work done to improve the situations in these regional and remote communities will be undone. Repealing the cashless debit card does not fix the problem this program sought to address; it merely adds to the issues that need fixing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not support this bill, and I ask senators to listen to the words of those living in these communities before putting your support behind it. Think about what will happen once the program is repealed. Think about the antisocial behaviour that will return once money can be freely accessed. And then think about all those children whose futures will change as a result of that support system being removed from their families. It's not a nice thought, is it?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:12</span>):  Time and time again, we hear fake cries from Labor and the Greens about the importance of consulting Australians on issues that affect them—that is, of course, until they are in government. Then, of course, things change. Seemingly overnight, Albanese and Labor have become all-knowing! They have an infinite knowledge of what is best for Australians. Don't dare question the so-called wisdom of Labor or the Greens. The swift and stealthy abolition of the cashless debit card by Labor and the Greens serves as another fine example of inner-city elites claiming to know what is best for you. Never mind the fact that most of these privileged Labor and Greens politicians have never set foot and will never set foot in the remote Indigenous communities and have never spoken and will never speak with those who directly benefit from the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there is no need, as these Canberra based politicians know best! How could one forget? That is especially the Greens MPs, from the inner-city suburbs, who share this deep and profound understanding of so-called issues affecting these communities yet have not found the time to consult amidst their very, very busy virtue-signalling. Don't let the increased rates of domestic violence, rape, assault, sexual assault, alcoholism or drug use get in the way of Labor and the Greens' plans to scrap the cashless debit card. Remember—these politicians know better than the communities facing these challenges!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's decision to abolish the cashless debit card has given the green light to more alcohol and drug abuse and more violence in some of our most vulnerable communities. Labor has recklessly walked away from these communities. Labor and the Greens do not care about the real-life consequences for the people of these communities. They would rather feel good about themselves as they scrap the cashless debit card in the name of their so-called fairness agenda. As long as these Labor and Greens politicians cannot see the rampant alcoholism, the sexual assaults, the rape, the domestic violence and the drug abuse in these communities, then, in their minds, it does not exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This sensible and life-changing measure is being abolished so these Labor and Greens politicians can just feel good about themselves. Prime Minister Albanese, Labor and the Greens know better than the director of strategy of the Cape York Partnership, Noel Pearson, who fears abolishing the cashless debit card will wipe out 20 years worth of his work in vulnerable Indigenous communities. Mr Pearson has said that, once the card is gone, the government will walk away, leaving his people to struggle with the return of violence, hunger and neglected children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With virtually no consultation, Labor has made it easier for those at risk to spend their taxpayer funded payments on activities and substances that cause harm to themselves, cause harm to their families and cause harm to their communities. If you don't believe me, take it from the Minderoo Foundation, who are concerned the decision to abolish the cashless debit card is being rushed through parliament without appropriate or meaningful community consultation. They said the removal of the cashless debit card has the potential to exacerbate vulnerability and this must be avoided at all costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the voices Prime Minister Albanese, Labor and the Greens conveniently silenced. Why? Because it does not fit their narrative. Please, spare us your sanctimonious lectures on community consultation. You're ramming this through after being in power for only four months. This decision will inevitably bring more alcoholism, more domestic violence, more hunger and malnourishment of children, and more rape and drug abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't wait for Labor and the Greens to step forward and accept responsibility. When they don't—and they won't—we will be holding them accountable for this appalling decision they are proposing to make. I cannot wait for the MPs who support the cashless debit card's abolition to head to these communities to help fight the scourge of alcohol and drug-fuelled domestic violence alongside, in many cases, the understaffed and under-resourced local police. I know that won't happen. If the government is successful in abolishing the cashless debit card, the Prime Minister and his inner-city-dominated government will be responsible for every additional violent crime and neglected child that will inevitably occur as a result. This government has not just botched the process; it is going to botch the future for so many important Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Findings from an independent impact evaluation by the University of Adelaide, released in 2021, reported that the cashless debit card has helped recipients improve their lives and the lives of their families and other community members. Findings include that 25 per cent of people reported they are drinking less since the cashless debit card's introduction; 21 per cent of cashless debit card participants reported gambling less, and evidence found that cash previously used for gambling has been redirected to essentials such as food; and 45 per cent of cashless debit card participants reported the cashless debit card had improved things for themselves and their families. There have been more than a dozen evaluations of the cashless debit card that have provided consistent evidence about welfare quarantine policies, showing decreases in drug and alcohol issues, decreases in crime violence and antisocial behaviour, improvements in child health and wellbeing, and improved financial management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Labor won't let these black-and-white facts get in the way of this reckless policy decision. When they scrap the cashless debit card, they will be directly responsible for the harm that is inflicted on individuals, families and entire communities. If Labor had bothered to properly consult with communities and speak to people on the front line, they would know there is overwhelming community support for the cashless debit card. It has saved families and transformed communities. The Western Australia police commissioner, Col Blanch, said the card has been beneficial in remote communities. He highlighted how it gives an opportunity for the more senior people in families and the elders of Aboriginal communities to use the money on food for children and on necessities. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It just seems to settle the community down and gives them better opportunity to spend their money on priority needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another facility Labor and the Greens would have you believe is that every single cent on the card is quarantined. This is not true. Generally, only 80 per cent of the recipient's welfare payment is quarantined onto the card. The remaining 20 per cent of the recipient's social security payments are transferred into the recipient's bank account and can be withdrawn and used without restriction. Those in Labor and the Greens might find this hard to believe, but the card is effective in blocking the purchase of alcohol and gambling products and only permits a portion of payments to be withdrawn as cash. Reducing the amount of cash that can be withdrawn also reduces the card user's ability to spend welfare payments on illegal drugs. This is fair. This is simple. As has been pointed out earlier this evening, no, it is not a silver bullet, but it has been effective in bringing about positive change in regional communities. You cannot argue with those facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us in the coalition have always believed in ensuring we care for and protect the most vulnerable in our society. Those opposite constantly purport to share this belief. However, the removal of the cashless debit card will bring violence and chaos back into the lives of our most vulnerable and will wreak havoc in regional communities. After all, Labor are only pursuing this policy because it makes them feel good about themselves. It makes those who live comfortable lives in comfortable homes in our capital cities feel warm and fuzzy inside. It is sickening to think that Labor's politicking has caused them to stoop so low that they have no regard for the safety and the welfare of the vulnerable in these communities, so long as they can abolish this card and give themselves a pat on the back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, Indigenous women and children are pleading for this card to stay. Regional police are begging for the card to stay. Indigenous elders are pleading for this card to stay. Regional mayors are pleading for this card to stay. Labor likes to bang on about an Indigenous Voice in this place, but the sad truth is that, according to them, Labor politicians and inner-city elites are the only voices worth listening to, not those whose lives will be directly affected if the cashless welfare card is scrapped. Quite simply, if you cannot directly see or are not directly affected by the alcohol and drug-fuelled domestic violence, rape, child neglect and sexual assault, then it does not exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, context is absent from the Labor-Greens narrative that this card is somehow inherently racist. They wouldn't have you know that the cashless debit card is part of a suite of measures to help people improve their circumstances. The coalition government made a total investment in supportive services of more than $110 million across cashless debit card sites, including a $30 million jobs fund and a job-ready initiative to strengthen local support services and help participants in cashless debit card communities to upskill, become job ready and get on pathways of employment and including $50 million for drug and alcohol residential rehabilitation facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Labor government had bothered to properly consult, it would have heard firsthand how the cashless debit card is making a real, positive difference across many communities from community leaders like Kalgoorlie-Boulder mayor John Bowler, who expressed his frustration:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It almost seems they [Labor] are putting the cart before the horse … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would have liked for them to come here, consult with us, consult with the community, and then make a decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition condemns the government for seeking to extend the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory without consultation or transparency while at the same time seeking to abolish the cashless debit card. Stakeholders consistently gave evidence that the cashless debit card was a significantly superior mechanism for the delivery of income management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent data from the Department of Social Services reveals that more than 4,500 people are currently voluntarily using the cashless debit card in the Northern Territory. Under the proposed legislation, these individuals will be forced to move back to the BasicsCard. It is unclear how many of these almost 4,500 people the government consulted or what their reactions were when they were told they would no longer have access to the cashless debit card. There is no evidence that any of these people were consulted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor like to think they are crusaders for fairness and social justice by scrapping this card. In actual fact, they are condemning families and entire communities to more chaos and violence. Shame on them. These people will not forget, and we will not forget, because we will hold this Labor-Green government to account for what havoc and what nastiness they have unleashed within these communities.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:25</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise on behalf of those rural and regional communities who seek to ensure that the cashless debit card remains a part of the way they manage their families' lives and the way they manage the provision of essential provisions for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes when we work in this city, and we come from the places that most of us in this place come from, the whole concept of a cashless debit card seems an anathema in a modern Australian environment—an affluent country, one of the top economic performers in the globe. Yet the reality, and sometimes the confronting reality, that we have to face, as the men and women who are tasked with leading our country at this period of our history, is that not everybody has been given the particular gifts that most of us that sit in this place have been given: a great education, supportive family and friends, and a community that's backed us and our potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is there are people, many Indigenous in this country, who haven't been given that opportunity. The cashless debit card has actually provided, particularly women and children, a safety net, a security to ensure that they can provide for the very real and essential needs that humans need to grow and prosper, particularly when they're far from the purvey of authority. That occurs in the far corners of this great nation and it occurs in the smaller communities of this great nation, and it occurs in silence because they do not have voices of power, they do not have the affluence that allows for them a strong voice. They're not the loudest person at the Uluru Statement and they're not the loudest person in their town halls. They are predominantly mothers in very remote parts of this country who struggle with a level of domestic violence and drug- and alcohol-fuelled abuse to both them and their children, that we don't speak often enough about here and we don't speak realistically enough about here. We're very heavy on the symbolism in this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a former minister who negotiated the Barkly Regional Deal with the Northern Territory government and the Barkly Regional Council following a terrible incident with a young two-year-old toddler in Tennant Creek. That really drove our coalition government under Malcolm Turnbull, the Territory government under former chief minister Gunner and the local government of Barkly Regional Council, to say: enough—enough of being silent about what is happening in these communities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all say we want to help and we all say we want to make it better. Well, you know what, the facts are, as much as you philosophically might not like it, the cashless debit card made it better. You know how we know that? It's not because we asked the rich guys. It's not because we asked the guys and girls in power. It's not because we asked the usual suspects, but because this Senate took our committees and our ears into communities on the ground, and we listened to the women and we listened to the children. We listened to those who are actually impacted by the realities of cash and income being used for negative purposes. And what is the outcome? Kids don't get fed before they go to school. Kids don't have footy boots to be the potentially magnificent AFL athletes—and I declare a bias—that Aboriginal boys and girls all aspire to be. We know from their stories that this makes a difference, and it doesn't matter whether it's Ceduna, the NT or Queensland—the Cashless Debit Card made an impact on and a difference to the people it was supposed to make a difference for, and that was a good thing.</span>

                    </a>  We are all sent—particularly in this chamber, because none of us are here with a majority vote—to represent the voiceless. I am very, very proud to sit in a parliament—and I have been here a little while—that has 11 Indigenous MPs from across all political spectrums, from all sides of politics and from both chambers who have been duly elected not because they are Indigenous but because Australians from all walks of life have selected them to be here because of their capacity and their merit. It doesn't matter whether I'm talking about Labor Party senators or our own Senators Nampijinpa Price and Liddle here on our side of the chamber. The one thing that I do reflect on from when they all arrived and they were making their maiden speeches was that it didn't matter where they sat politically—all of them came to this place to make a practical impact on the future prosperity and the future aspirations of Indigenous Australians.</span>

Every parent aspires to their child reaching their potential, but if you don't have those frameworks, bedrocks and foundations in place as a family—and there are a whole lot of families that don't have those foundations in place—then your kids really don't have much of a chance to succeed. They really don't, Senator Rice.</span>

The Northern Territory has made a decision to end the ban on alcohol in our communities. They've lifted that. The sunset's occurred. It's coming back. We're having alcohol in our communities like we haven't seen it before.' Simultaneously, the Labor government is choosing to rid these families, and these women in particular, of a powerful mechanism to keep control of the economies in their families and to make sure that they've got something, other than their own will and physical presence, to stop people from taking the money for other purposes so they can actually say: 'You know what, brother? Our kids are going to school. I'm buying food this week. It's not me; it's the government. They're making me take care of my children.'</span>

It's an indictment on you, on us and on state governments around this country.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:40</span>):  I can't say it's a pleasure to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022, because I'm sickened by the Labor Party for bringing this bill on. I'm sickened by those opposite who refused to listen to the voices of the women and the children in Indigenous communities. And I'm sickened by the paternalism that underpins this policy, which ignores the grotesque family violence—like men maiming, injuring, raping or assaulting black women. And one of the drivers of this is money. I'm going to really say it as it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens in these communities is that if the women do not hand over cash then they will be assaulted, abused and sometimes even killed by black men in alcohol fuelled family violence. Until Labor members and senators have been to the Alice Springs women's refuge, none of them should be bringing this bill forward. The Alice Springs women's refuge is a place that I spoke about in my first speech in this place. I visited there when I was chairing a House committee looking into family violence law reform. It gave me an incredible insight into what's actually going on in many Indigenous communities. It's the dark, horrific truth that we don't see in Canberra, that we don't see in the big cities. We only see it if we go out there. This woman's refuge is, in reality, a homicide prevention centre. It's built with two walls. There's an inner wall that prevents the men who are trying to get to the women from climbing over the wall and either maiming or killing the women. I could not believe my eyes when I visited this place, because it was the first time I had truly understood the scale of the violence in communities in and around Alice Springs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My eyes are open in terms of many things that happen in Indigenous communities. I proudly work for National Indigenous Television. Its headquarters were in Alice Springs. I was part of a great group of people, most of whom were young Indigenous men and women—amazing storytellers, amazing film makers—and it was an absolute honour to work for NITV. I saw the very, very best of Indigenous Australia on display at NITV. But I'd never encountered anything like this until I visited the Alice Springs women's refuge. There's a double door into that refuge to increase the safety of women going into the centre so that they pass through a safety gate. They close one safety gate behind them and they get into a second door. And do you know what's happened in there? Some men, determined to destroy the lives of their womenfolk, have actually got into that centre, and there has been at least one murder. So, as I say, I am absolutely sickened by this government's initiative to stop the cashless debit card, which enables women and children more freedom from family violence. It enables women to feed their families. They are not holding cash. There is no incentive for the menfolk to bash the women for cash, which they then use to go out and buy more alcohol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect, and we have heard some wonderful contributions from my coalition senate colleagues, on the words of Noel Pearson, the founder and director of strategy at the Cape York Partnership. He said, 'I think this legislation will wipe out 20 years of my work. In the absence of a solution that had the same functionality of the cashless debit card, our Family Responsibilities Commission and the welfare reform work that we have done over the last 20 years would collapse, and that would be a very bad thing. We would just have to give up. We would come to the point of giving up on the idea that we can change anything for the future of these communities. You guys will repeal this thing and then you will walk away. You will repeal the card and then you will walk away and leave us to the violence, leave us to the hunger, leave us to the neglected children.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard in this debate, this is not a silver bullet. This does not stop all dysfunction, family violence and abuse in communities, but it makes a really big difference. We now know that Labor is crawling back on this because of its amendments to extend the CDC, which represents a very embarrassing backflip by the Albanese Labor government. Labor went out before the election and misrepresented the good work of this card. Now we see these amendments before the Senate which will allow Cape York, the CDC trial sites and those in the Northern Territory who have voluntarily transitioned from the BasicsCard onto the cashless debit card to remain on the cashless debit card. So this is a gross admission that this Albanese Labor government has messed up this ill-conceived commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse than this, even worse than a botched election commitment is the fact that Labor decided the voices of the women in Indigenous and other communities throughout this country didn't matter. I tell you what's going on out there. When the committee members were travelling to take evidence on the card, the women were too scared to give evidence. That's actually the truth. Many women who want that card were too scared because—guess what. If they gave evidence that they want the card to stay, they will return to their home and they will get bashed. So I say to this Albanese Labor government: I am sickened by this decision. This card was doing a lot of really good work. As I say, it was not a silver bullet, but it was an innovative program designed to tackle social harm, particularly associated with drug and alcohol addiction in communities with high rates of long-term social security dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is substantial evidence of its success. Those opposite can ignore the evidence, but it is there. Findings from an independent impact evaluation by the University of Adelaide released in 2021 reported that the cashless debit card had helped recipients improve their lives and the lives of their families and other community members. Even if it didn't help every life, why would Labor think it was a good idea to get rid of it? Seriously? This is helping Australians. This is making a difference. The University of Adelaide's study found that 25 per cent of people reported that they are drinking less since the cashless debit card's introduction, 21 per cent of cashless debit card participants reported gambling less, and evidence found that cash previously used for gambling—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  I was recently contacted by Dr Sophie Reid-Singer, who shared with me the awful experience she had accessing the disability support pension. Tonight, I have the honour of sharing Sophie's story with you. In her words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My name is Sophie Reid-Singer. I'm 26 years old, she/her, and have a disability called spondylometaphyseal dysplasia—kozlowski type or SMD-K—which was diagnosed at two years old.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Doctors define this as a rare form of dwarfism but more accurately SMD-K is a rare congenital bone disease. SMD-K is a one in a million diagnosis and is lifelong. Symptoms of the disease I have include uneven and shortened stature, bow legs, waddling gait, chronic pain of the joints, small hands and feet, and scoliosis. Most affected are the weight bearing bones like hips, knees, spine and ankles. Undoubtedly, I will develop osteoarthritis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In my childhood, extensive surgery was performed on both my legs to straighten them using techniques including tibial osteotomy with braces from 2009 to 2011. These treatments were intended to keep me out of a wheelchair, although I still struggle walking long distances and presently use a cane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Symptoms of SMD are mild at birth but deteriorate gradually with age, so early intervention is imperative to reduce pain and improve my quality of life. My main symptom is chronic pain. I am never comfortable, I always hurt. This means my brain never steps, and interplays with my anxiety quite profoundly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That said, trying to navigate Services Australia is the biggest pain I experience. I've tried to access the DSP since I was 18. I am 26 now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It took my whole adult life to get access to the welfare scheme designed specifically for people like me because of the means testing used to grade the severity of my disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A permanent diagnosis is NEVER enough. The use of impairment tables to assess people's impairment and eligibility for the DSP was actioned in 2012 by the Gillard Labor government's welfare-to-work regime, right before I became an adult. I will not be lectured about disability and work capacity by this abled woman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I moved to Brisbane from rural Queensland at 17 to study at university. Independence is my most important value. It took time to put my ego aside and admit I needed help, but even longer to gather the documentation I needed to apply for the DSP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I first applied in 2015 with a letter from the orthopaedic surgeon responsible for straightening my legs. It took several months for Centrelink to organise a Job Capacity assessment and then half a year to determine I was unsuitable for hard labour tasks such as bricklaying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To attend my Job Capacity assessment I took the bus one stop from where I lived to get closer to the Woolloongabba Centrelink, so I could walk to my assessment. This distance was huge for me. I walked using crutches, which I used for over a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Even after the hour-long assessment, and the evidence I supplied from my doctors detailing the extensive reconstructive surgery I'd had, along with my prognosis, and even details on my life expectancy (which I was asked for) Centrelink still rejected me. I appealed this rejection but lost. I was humiliated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I accessed and relied on a partial payment, Youth Allowance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If I was on the DSP from when I first applied, when I finally got a job I'd have been able to keep the payment and work. When I accessed the partial payment of Youth Allowance instead of DSP, I was held to the same expectations as my abled peers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When Centrelink took the payment away entirely, I struggled and couldn't maintain my employment. Maybe if I had the DSP I could have afforded a taxi to get to work instead of endangering myself with two inaccessible trains and then a kilometre walk to my workplace. On days when I couldn't carpool or get a lift to and from the station, I'd be too exhausted and my performance suffered. This year I applied with the second letter from a geneticist Centrelink had received from me in my adult life, detailing everything they could possibly need to know, including the statement, "there is no cure".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Debating my capacity is cruel when I do not get better. I was rejected and had to appeal once more. During my appeal I was told my application for DSP was fast-tracked because of how much I complained and how distressed I became, now I am considered vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am distressed because of the Job Capacity assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Now I am finally on the DSP, it is mandated I repeat this same process every two years. This includes unpacking my complex medical trauma over the phone for a stranger who has never heard of my disability. Please, I can't handle this anymore. Please stop having me prove I am useless to access welfare, how do you expect me to live with myself?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Excuse my language, but it is 'yucky' to follow up my medical assessment with questions like can I write with a pencil, do the groceries, or use the bathroom by myself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The lady on the complaints line for Services Australia assures me this changes when I'm 35, only once every 5 years. This is not a dignified way to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Please stop putting barriers up, these initiatives are for people like me but I can't access them without debasing myself entirely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A low ball estimate of the money Centrelink has withheld from me in the seven years it took to be approved is $163,800. That's a lot of hip replacements I could buy. With all the time and energy I expend wading through endless bureaucracy I wish I had time to worry about my prognosis that I'll be a young person requiring hip replacements</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A hip surgery is due to cost $36 000 for just one hip on public health. The advice has been to wait until the pain is too much to bear because I will have to keep getting these for the rest of my life—they do not last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is recommended every 3 years I get full body xrays to check the status of my skeleton. Is having Centrelink review my disability every 2 years absolutely necessary?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To access DSP this year I had to undergo not one but two job capacity assessments by a nurse and government contracted doctor. It is not fair that I have to negotiate my access to society on a basis of whether I can stand up from a seated position, or turn my head left or right, or carry 2L milk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Isn't it enough that I have a congenital bone disease?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From the moment I was diagnosed my disability has governed my every civil liberty. I asked the nurse conducting my over-the-phone job capacity assessment what he could tell me about my disability and he said he wasn't qualified to offer that insight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Please stop making me endure this to satisfy some legislation some guy wrote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The legislation needs to be written by a disabled person, there is no compromise about this. Please have someone with a lived experience of disability write the next assessment guidelines. There needs to be a fair system in place, but this present one excludes disabled people like me. When Australia signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 it made a commitment to dignified inclusion in society for us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I can't even advocate that I am in pain without an accompanying doctor's note. What is the point of the mountains of evidence I have submitted in my adult lifetime to prove I cannot be cured and am useless to Centrelink? It is meaningless when eligibility is based on whether I can stand up from a seated position. I don't want to complete another Job Capacity assessment for as long as I live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I just moved to Melbourne to study law specifically so I can represent myself and others trying to access disability services. I'm not allowed to advocate myself, but if I was a lawyer I could represent myself via a technicality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Now that I am on DSP I am determined to get the impairment tables abolished in the next two years prior to my reassessment. This is a matter of survival for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our prime Minister Anthony Albanese grew up to a single mother on the DSP in public housing, except when he was growing up it was referred to as the Invalid Pension—the impairment tables were no barrier to him when they were introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sophie is right. I call upon the government to respond to the recommendations of the inquiry into the DSP that reported early this year—in particular, the recommendations to investigate how the requirement that the condition be fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised is preventing people from accessing the DSP—and to undertake an in-depth clinical review of the impairment tables. In the light of experiences like Sophie's, it's the least the government can do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:00</span>):  I recently highlighted the work of two outgoing Tasmanian mayors, Annie Revie and Julie Arnold, in this chamber. Today I would like to acknowledge the remaining eight mayors who are retiring at the upcoming local elections in Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been interesting to watch the evolution of local government over the years. No longer solely about rates, roads and rubbish, local councils offer a broad range of services and can, in some instances, lobby on behalf of the community to ensure state and federal governments deliver on promises and projects for their city, town or region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A notable example of such lobbying was the coalition government's policy of City Deals. Both Launceston and Hobart received City Deals under the previous government, and multiple projects are coming to fruition from these 10-year commitments. Tasmania is on the cusp of change at a grassroots level as my state approaches the local government elections in October. It is fitting that the elections will be held in spring, traditionally a time of renewal, as 10 Tasmanian mayors are retiring from public life, many after significant years as an elected official. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local government is a level of government whose importance cannot be understated. While we here in this chamber discuss matters of state or national importance, local government is the closest level to the public. Someone who understands that vital connection of government with the public is outgoing City of Launceston mayor Albert van Zetten. Albert has spent the past 17 years in local government and is Launceston's longest serving mayor. After five successive terms as mayor, Albert is stepping down from this position in just a few weeks, when Tasmanians will cast their vote for who they wish to serve them at a local level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an aside, these local government elections will be the first held under Tasmania's new compulsory voting legislation. The City of Launceston town hall is just a block from my electoral office, but my dealings with Albert span well beyond my time in the Senate and his time as mayor. Albert spent more than 30 years as a chartered accountant and served as Launceston City Mission's CEO for 30 years. Albert and his wife, Lyndle, have been involved with and supported many community organisations throughout Northern Tasmania during this time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was celebrating from the sidelines when Albert was first elected to the City of Launceston Council in 2005 and thrilled when he was elected mayor in 2007. Over almost two decades in local government, Albert has strived to make Launceston one of the world's greatest and most liveable regional cities. He believes in community collaboration and the idea that teamwork can make the impossible possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With these big picture aims in mind, I want to share some of Albert's key achievements as Launceston's mayor. A significant project and one that has transformed the fabric of the city and surrounding suburbs is the Launceston City Deal. As with other City Deals this project is a joint initiative between all three levels of government and was delivered in 2017 by the City of Launceston, Tasmanian Liberal state government and the coalition federal government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Launceston City Deal allowed Albert to work on something close to his heart: revitalising Launceston's northern suburbs by building stronger communities. This has been achieved by the My Place, My Future project in the northern suburbs, comprising Mowbray, Newnham, Mayfield, Rocherlea, Waverley, Ravenswood and Invermay. The suburbs account for around a third of Launceston's population. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My place, My Future initiatives include Barbers for Life, with barbers trained to support the community and raise awareness around suicide prevention, as well as to create sharp styles. There is also Say G'Day on Bin Day, which helps to build relationships between neighbours that build safer and stronger communities. And the ABCDE Learning Sites program fosters connections between suburbs. I know My Place, My Future was driven by Albert's passion for this part of Launceston, and the northern suburbs are stronger for his efforts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another venture realised under our City Deal was the ambitious $240 million Northern Transformation Project, where the University of Tasmania relocated to a new campus at Inveresk, within easy reach of the Launceston CBD. The first of three buildings has already opened at the Inveresk campus. University students, staff and the public enjoy the stunning new library and associated public spaces, including a community garden and Esk Activities Space, complete with sports courts. Construction has started on the second and third buildings—River's Edge and Willis Street—with the entire campus to be complete by 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Launceston City Deal also includes $140 million funding for river health improvement programs within the Tamar Estuary. This initiative progresses TasWater infrastructure upgrades and ties in with Tasmanian government and Launceston and West Tamar local government visions for this important riverway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementing the completed flood levies around Launceston, the iconic all-abilities recreation facility Riverbend Park is another project completed under Albert's watch. Built on a former industrial site at the edge of the Tamar, and connected to the popular Seaport precinct, Riverbend Park contains four zones of play equipment along with barbecue facilities and sports courts. Riverbend is home to the skywalk and the confluence net, two of the largest pieces of play equipment in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Launceston's City Heart Project aims to make the city's CBD the premier lifestyle hub for Northern Tasmanians and cement its reputation as the country's most liveable regional city. Launceston City Heart includes redeveloping the city's public spaces, namely Quadrant Mall, Brisbane Street Mall and Civic Square. This project is the largest ever undertaken by the council, and its first stage was initiated and completed during Albert's tenure as mayor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mayors and counsellors who have the foresight to look at the big picture for their communities can deliver meaningful reforms and community assets that pay dividends in the years to come. Another of those big-picture thinkers is outgoing Devonport mayor Annette Rockliff. She has been steadfast at the helm of Devonport's greatest urban renewal project—Living City. The Living City project has developed civic buildings like the $48 million paranaple centre, which recently hosted our state conference. It was also the venue for the Sustainable Economic Growth for Regional Australia conference, marking the first time Tasmania hosted this national event. However, Living City is not only about civic buildings; this initiative will soon deliver a public playground and open space attached to a new Novotel hotel on the waterfront overlooking the Mersey River. Separate to Living City, Devonport's port is undergoing a $240 million upgrade to deliver modern infrastructure for the port and to support the continued growth of the Spirit of Tasmania's ferry and freight services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Annette has been Devonport mayor since 2018, taking on the role after the resignation of former senator Steve Martin. She has served 15 years on the council and became deputy mayor in 2014. As such, she has been integral to the conversations on these developments and has overseen various stages of Living City, activating Devonport's city centre and transforming it for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years, Tasmanian communities have been held in good stead by a vast array of strong rural women like Annette who enthusiastically create change in their communities. Another of those is Central Coast mayor Jan Bonde. She has been heading up that council for 12 years and been an elected member for 17 years—an incredible achievement. Jan has also been at the forefront of renewal in Ulverstone and the Central Coast area, overseeing community asset redevelopments like the showground precinct, Ulverstone Wharf, Anzac Park and the new hive museum and art gallery. They are a boon for that region. Under Jan's leadership, Central Coast has become an active and thriving community. Jan counts this community reducing its waste by 45 per cent among one of her finest achievements as mayor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the reality of public life is that it's not suited to everyone—something that became apparent for many of the mayors who are retiring at this election. Kentish mayor Tim Wilson is not recontesting his position after one term in office. Tim took over the role from predecessor Don Thwaites and was elected unopposed in 2018. His decision to resign from his role is financial, outlining his return to full-time employment as he does not feel he can adequately support himself and his family on a rural mayoral salary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family is a common theme for Tasmanian mayors who have reconsidered their roles. Waratah-Wynyard mayor Robbie Walsh, Circular Head mayor Daryl Quilliam, Clarence Council mayor Doug Chipman and Huon Valley mayor Bec Enders—who left her position earlier this year—all cited a desire to have more time with their families as part of their decision to resign. While there is excitement in renewal, we must take pause to consider the realities of a commitment to public life and how we can create new opportunities for the next crop of political leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the outgoing mayors of Tasmania for their service and contribution to our community. I look forward to working together with the successful candidates for council positions at the October elections.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:09</span>):  I rise having listened to the contributions of two of my female colleagues in this chamber, from both the Greens political party and the Liberal National Party. I want to acknowledge the importance of democracy, the importance of the voices that are put on the record. I want to acknowledge the challenges of managing a system in terms of access to supports that are necessary. I also want to acknowledge—and I'm very pleased to be the co-chair of the MS support group here, the Parliamentary Friends of Multiple Sclerosis here in the parliament, with Senator Askew—the service that people give in public life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made a decision, since we were last here, that I will commence each of my speeches in this place, until the matter of the Ukraine invasion is resolved, with this statement: I support the people of Ukraine in their defence of their sovereignty and the defence of democracy. We should never underestimate the importance of what we do in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise this evening to speak to a domestic matter, which is the appalling conduct of the software giant Apple and its absolutely outrageous campaign to keep workers down at a time of unprecedented economic turmoil. Firstly, Apple failed, in recent negotiations about wages, to notify the relevant unions, which are namely the SDA—'the shoppies union' as it's affectionately known—and the ASU. When negotiations started about a proposed EBA they repeatedly refused to give those two unions, representing thousands of workers, enough time to appropriately review the EBA that was being proposed. This is a breach of fundamental duties. Democracy only works with the currency of trust. Sadly, we have seen some of the biggest companies, with the most significant profits, abuse the responsibilities that they have to operate under a social licence in our free economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an even more shocking move than failing to notify, organisers in South Australia were confronted by Apple management and asked to sign non-disclosure agreements. When the organisers, rightly, refused to sign those NDAs they were escorted off the premises. This is absolutely heavy-handed and unnecessary behaviour by a company that purports, in its advertising, to be one of the greatest supporters of people and their capacity, ingenuity and creativity across the globe. The reality is, and this has been voiced by Prime Minister Albanese, that we can move forward and advance this country without conflict. We can actually seek agreement and that is what the Australian people want to see. They want leaders in business and in politics to find ways forward that are less conflicting and more harmonising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Capital and labour do not have to be in conflict, but when dodgy bosses, as Apple has revealed itself to be in this instance, seek to do the sorts of things they have done to silence critics, to crush workers, to breach good faith protocols and to pay below award wages then the reality is conflict is constructed. In these circumstances unions will stand up and fight back. Workers who show up every day in their workplace—and who are busy just doing their jobs, managing their family responsibilities, supporting activity in their local community—do not have, in many cases, the knowledge or the capacity or the time to take on multinational corporations. Unions are a vital part of effective democracies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The actions that we've seen by Apple in this instance are extraordinary, especially coming as a modus operandi from a company that took in $366 billion in revenue last year. This is no small to medium enterprise. This is a significant multinational player in the economy. Let me state that again: $366 billion in revenue. That is more than many countries around the world. Of that $366 billion, $11 billion was made in Australia. It disgusts me that Apple is trying to crush the 4,000 workers it has in this country, to diminish or obliterate their rights and, in addition to that, to cover up this union-demonising and union-bashing practice that it has established.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ridiculous and vindictive union-busting techniques have been imported from other jurisdictions, including the USA, where some enormous employers pay their workers such a pittance that they create a working poor, people who work every hour that they can but for an employer that pays them so badly that they need food stamps in order to eat and to provide the basics of food and shelter for the family. While Apple reaps billions in profits, this sort of egregious, overplayed, aggressive stance against the workers of this nation cannot be allowed to go without comment. Frankly, it is un-Australian behaviour, and we should never have a bar of that. It's very clear that Labor stands with these workers at Apple. The union movement is fighting for the rights of the workers not only to organise, which is a basic right, but also to bargain for a fair deal in a way that allows their representatives through the union to participate for them in a meaningful way and not at the last moment after days or weeks of deception. Having a below-inflation pay rise, a lack of rostering protections and a high threshold for overtime is neither right nor fair. No decent Aussie could ever endorse such action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter is currently in the hands of the Fair Work Commission, who will determine whether Apple's conduct is unlawful or not, but it is clearly unethical. We need wages to grow in the country and multinationals to pay their workers a living wage. Corporations need to pay attention to their social licence to practise business in Australia, and, with inflation rising, we need to look out for the sort of dodgy EBA we're seeing in the case of Apple being rammed through that will push workers and their families even further behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note that two leaders of the SDA, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Union, which is the union for retail workers, fast-food workers and warehouse workers, have been in the parliament today. They have been making sure that people are aware of the legal action being taken by the union against McDonald's. Most recently they've been using section 540 of the Fair Work Act to secure compensation for workers who were allegedly denied their lawful 10-minute breaks at over a thousand current and former sites by the fast-food giant. Many Australians would have known McDonald's as their first employer, and they do employ a lot of 14-year-olds and those aged 14 and nine months. The reality is that the SDA has been investigating and raising members' awareness about not receiving their legal entitlement to paid rest breaks since 2017. With a workforce of over 107,000 people and with 1,010 restaurants, McDonalds is one of Australia's largest employers. You'd think they would be able to get the systems right. After all, they can have two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun, and the right number of pickles and the right amount of sauce will go on. They should also be able to pay their workers their right entitlements by law. There shouldn't be a trade-off—get the bun right; get the wages wrong. No. They should be getting the wages right. Labor is on the side of workers, and the union is standing up for this group of people, who really deserved a whole lot better from a company that is placed right across this nation in every community. I will be keeping an eye on this case and making sure that Australian workers get a fair go. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
