                  </a>  I note that the government has a proposal on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for another variation of hours—this time, though, to apply the guillotine in relation to their climate bills, and in applying that guillotine their intention is to ensure that debate concludes by 1.30 pm today. Let's understand that we haven't even started the committee stage on this bill yet. There are eight pages of legislative amendments proposed from the crossbench and elsewhere around the chamber. From seven different senators there are some 16 different amendments, some of them detailed amendments with nine different clauses attached, and the government's proposal is to truncate this debate into this morning only in relation to the passage of these bills and the conclusion of the committee stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are making an offer to the government in this regard: don't have the guillotine; we're happy to stay here for as long as it takes until the bill is done. That is the motion that we're circulating. We're not preventing you from concluding this bill; we are, though, suggesting that you should live up to the higher standards you said that you would bring to government. You as an opposition continually criticised the use of the guillotine. Senator Wong herself at one stage said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would remind those opposite that, whatever criticisms you might have of us, you are guillotining when you have been offered more time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion I seek leave to move offers more time for those opposite to have their bill considered. Indeed, Senator Wong then ascribed motive as to why the then government was guillotining. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You are not guillotining and gagging because it is the end of the session—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">well, it's not the end of the session right now—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You are not guillotining and gagging because … you have to get bills through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They certainly don't have time pressures to get this bill through. She said, 'You are guillotining now so that you can hold a prime ministerial press conference in time for prime-time television.' Guess what they're doing? They're guillotining by 1.30 today so that they can hold a prime ministerial press conference in time for prime-time television. The exact criticism that Senator Wong levelled at the former government is what they are now doing in the first week, essentially, in which the Senate has got down to the consideration of legislation and business—this first time. </span>

We will stay as long as it takes for you to have the bill considered, to get the bill done, and, equally, for those on the crossbench to have the chance for all their amendments—be they Greens amendments, be they other crossbench amendments—to get the airing they deserve through that process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an invitation to the crossbench: if you don't like our proposal, that doesn't mean you have to go with the government's proposal for such a short, sharp guillotine either. You don't have to work to the Labor Party's media cycle. You don't have to work to the Prime Minister's press conference schedule. You can dictate your terms, because what is being proposed in the motion that Senator Gallagher has brought to the chamber is far too short. What is being proposed demonstrates an arrogance from those opposite already, clearly working in collusion with the Greens—that they think they can just ram things through, that they can use this Senate as a rubber stamp, that they will do whatever deals outside this chamber but then not care about what happens in the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opportunity for the crossbench and for the Greens to demonstrate that they're bigger and better than that. Of course, the Greens themselves were even more strident critics of the use of guillotines previously. And yet last night we saw the Greens, amazingly, guillotining their own disallowance motion. They moved to guillotine themselves in that process. So this, Greens, is an invitation to you, too. Live up to the standards, Senator Waters, that you called for previously. We've said we're happy to sit longer. We're not seeking to prevent debate. Indeed, we've indicated we will give primacy to the Climate Change Bill, as we will then to dealing with other important bills such as the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, as is scheduled. All we're proposing is extra sitting hours, time for debate, rather than the use of the guillotine. </span>

And one thing that will never change, no matter what—no matter what facts are put on the table; no matter how many of their safe, moderate Liberal seats they lose—is that the coalition will never support action on climate. They will never support action on climate. Senator Birmingham comes in here and says: 'We want a debate. We'll stay here.' You've had nine years. You've had nine years and an election campaign where you lost seats on this issue—that's a matter for you. The Australian people have spoken: 'Enough delay.' No amount of talking will change your mind. No amount of talking will give you some principle on this issue, because on this you have no principle. On this you have had no principle in a decade, and you all know that.</span>

                  </a>  'It's not true.' She says it's not true. Well, it is, and history demonstrates that, as does the election result. If there were ever a parliament that had been elected—regardless of what differences of views we have—to take action on climate, it is this one, in this place and the other. So don't come in here and pretend that you are somehow safeguarding democratic principles. You're not. You're safeguarding your outdated, conservative position which the Australian people have left behind. That's what you're safeguarding. You're safeguarding your internal unity because you don't have the spine to take on the people in your party room. No matter how long we are here, you will not change your votes.

I commented in the chamber some time ago that it's like the last days of the Soviet Union—against progress. The world has changed, but you're still holding on to opposing action on climate. I do respect that there are those who have different views. Senator Roberts has different views on this, and I understand that. But the government has been elected with a very clear policy position which is reflected in the legislation before you. Everybody knows that, no matter how long we stayed—we could debate this all week—those opposite would not change. I would remind them that they have chosen also to filibuster on a range of other matters, so that it would defer debate on this. Delay, delay, delay—obstruction. I think the Australian people have had enough. On that basis, I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments would increase the targets for cutting pollution in this country to something resembling science. The legislation that we have before us today was designed not by climate scientists but by political scientists, and the flimsy 43 per cent emissions reduction target that this legislation will enshrine is not enough. It's not based on science, and it puts us nowhere near the 1½-degree aspiration of the Paris Agreement on climate. It puts us closer to two degrees, which we know is an incredibly risky scientific situation where we may see catastrophic effects that set off a chain reaction that is not stoppable. I don't know about anyone else in this chamber, but I can't actually bear the thought of that. We must do everything we can to stop that from happening.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are moving today to change the targets in this bill to a 75 per cent reduction by 2030, which is what the science says is necessary. People will have heard us say before that this isn't just the Greens' proposition. This is what international scientists are recommending is the necessary target for our nation to help us do our bit to globally keep warming limited to 1½ degrees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have support for this amendment—spoiler alert! The two big parties will both oppose this, because we know the influence of the fossil fuel sector on this building, and it continues while those political donations continue to flow into the coffers of both of the big political parties. I see the now opposition shaking their heads about how we keep mentioning this inconvenient fact, but one does wonder what is the basis for the climate policy of the other parties when it's not science and when they do take millions in donations from fossil fuel companies. It's pretty hard not to draw the conclusion of who's in charge of writing climate policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we are moving today to increase the targets to 75 per cent by 2030 and to make sure that our net-zero target is brought forward to 2035. We can actually do this, and I have a lot of confidence and optimism in the ability of our nation and our workers to take this transition seriously and create the fantastic domestic manufacturing opportunities that 100 per cent renewables will provide. This could be a real boon for our economy, and I think most people understand that. They know that coal is on the way out. Even the coal workers themselves know. They know they're being lied to when the big parties claim that the coal industry will still be employing them in decades to come. They just want to know what happens next and they want a chance to say what happens next in their local region, and they deserve that say. You'll hear us continue to talk about a worker led transition and a transition authority. We look forward to progressing, through various different channels, because this country is ready to have, and capable of having, 100 per cent clean, renewable energy and a prosperous economy that will flow from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can meet net zero by 2035, and we don't really have a choice, because look at what we're already facing with the natural disasters. I'm from South-East Queensland. We've just had terrible floods that we are still recovering from. Of course, that then went down to the Northern Rivers, exacerbating the homelessness crisis that was already there. We actually can't take the increasingly severe and regular natural disasters. It's too much for people to bear, so we've got to do everything we can to avoid that and have targets that reflect science and give us the best shot of not only managing and lessening those natural catastrophes them but actually embracing the future, the new green economy that will be good for workers, good for regional communities, good for our agricultural sector, good for our tourism sector and good for all of us. It is a jobs generator. There are no economic downsides except for the coal and gas companies, who are used to bringing in record profits, paying no tax, ripping off their workers and having fancy dinners with people in this building. They are the people that will miss out under a clean economy, and I'm okay with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're moving this amendment today because, if we stick with the 43 per cent, it just makes the task harder later. If we've got science based targets that we can work towards delivering now, that transition can be smoother and it can be managed. If this government kicks the can down the road then the task for the next parliament will be harder, and those cuts will need to be deeper and faster than in an approach that is based on science from the outset and allows us to plan that transition to 2030 and to 2035. The science won't forgive us if we kick the can down the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I don't expect we'll get support for this amendment today, because, sadly, the fossil fuel companies seem to have more influence than the scientists in this building. Maybe one day that that will change. Perhaps we'll see a government with the guts to say, 'We're going to ban donations from fossil fuel companies, because we're sick of them running our democracy.' Certainly the Greens have been saying that for 10-odd years, and we look forward to the day when that actually becomes law. But, until such time as that happens, we want to see this 43 per cent target increased in this term of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of my colleagues have said, the climate wars are not over when you are still ignoring science and when you are opening new coal and gas mines. As we know—and I'll be asking the minister some questions about this—there are 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline that this government has to decide whether it's going to approve or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so that brings me to my first question to the minister, and it's about your modelling behind the 43 per cent target. Have you factored in the emissions from those 114 new coal and gas projects? To be specific, there are 69 new coalmines and 45 new gas projects proposed in the pipeline. Have you factored the emissions from those projects into your modelling to create your 43 per cent target?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I was very interested in this amendment, and I note the points that have been made by the Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate in proposing this amendment, but I'm also interested in modelling. This is just in relation to the points that have been made about the idea that we would be replacing 43 per cent with 75 per cent—setting aside the fact that the coalition believes this is legislating something that doesn't need legislating. Given the commitment made by the new Australian government to the relevant international bodies about our emissions reductions target, as has been said by their own environment spokesperson, this is just a symbolic move. But I would be interested in what modelling the Australian Greens have done on the impact to household bills if this new threshold were brought in. What would it cost for any household? What would be the increase to the average quarterly power bill? What would be the cost to those who wish to fill their car up with diesel—their Toyota Hilux, for example? What cost would be applied to household budgets that are already under pressure? As we know, only yesterday we had the—what day is it? Thursday. Two days ago, we had the Reserve Bank of Australia hand down their decision on interest rates, which, of course, we're seeing passed on by the major banks. I think—or at least I'd hope—that all of us in this place have a high degree of concern about the impact this would have on household budgets. I think that's one of the most important things we need to have regard for here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said many times, there are two fragile things that we need to look after here. One is the environment, and we need to take practical, science based, commonsense steps in that regard to protect the environment. But also we need to protect the economy, because without a functioning economy—much as without a healthy, thriving environment—we can't live. We can't keep the houses warm, the lights on or the ovens cooking our dinners. So I just wonder. I ask this question, like Senator Whish-Wilson, as someone who comes from a state where energy generation is 100 per cent renewable for domestic consumption, something I'm very proud of—although we do use coal to create concrete, which is probably one of the only materials that it will be possible to use to replace timber when we phase out native forest logging in this country, as, unfortunately, it appears is going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would be interested—going back to my original question—in what impact the Australian Greens' proposal will have and what modelling that is based on. I'm assuming they've done modelling for this proposal. If there is no modelling, please tell us, because that just demonstrates that there is no regard for the impact for Australian households, and the budget's already under strain.</span>

This has been described—and I reinforce it—as the most important bill that's ever been introduced into this parliament in terms of its costs and its consequences to the people of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quote some costings found by an independent economist, Dr Alan Moran. These cannot be sensibly refuted, Minister, because they came from the government's own figures, budgets and department reports, state and federal. The report, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">hidden </span><span style="font-style:italic;">cost of climate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">policies</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> and renewables</span>, prepared in August 2020, states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">this is not basic cost for electricity; this is additional costs for electricity due to the financial impact of climate policies and renewable subsidies—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the median income is $51,000, the after-tax median income is about $46,000. How the hell can anyone on $46,000 a year take-home afford an extra $1,300? That's before the impact of this savage rise to 43 per cent that the government proposes. In addition, according to the report—this was when the Morrison government was in power—the extra climate policies and renewable subsidies account for 39 per cent of household electricity bills, not 6½ per cent as the government typically quotes. Thirty-nine per cent—almost 40 per cent—of the cost of a household bill is additional costs due to climate policies and renewable subsidies. The report finds that there's a net loss of jobs in the economy, with every solar and wind job created causing 2.2 jobs to be lost in the real, productive economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is anyone interested in that? It's not the people in this house that will be affected; it's the large majority of Australians who will suffer. Also, the market distortion through subsidies to solar and wind increases the wholesale price of electricity to $92.50 per megawatt hour, up from $45.40 per megawatt hour. It's going to be horrendous. This will cost Australians trillions of dollars. It's a highly regressive tax because it will be much more impactful on the vulnerable and the people on low income.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, we saw Senator Wong, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, in proposing this bill, unable to define what net zero is. They do not know what their own policy is. We just wanted a simple interpretation from the Leader of the Government in the Senate as to what net zero means, and she could not provide it. I'll tell you why you can't: because you've never provided any logical scientific points which are simply empirical scientific evidence provided in a framework that proves cause and effect. No-one in this chamber, nor any predecessor to anyone in this chamber, has ever provided that. You have never provided the specific quantified effect of carbon dioxide from human activity on any climate factor, whether it be temperature—air temperature, ocean temperature or land temperature—or the frequency, severity or duration of storms, droughts, floods or snowfall. You've never provided the effect on ocean alkalinity or ocean salinity. You've never provided the specific impact, and yet that is fundamental to any policy. If you cannot provide the specific impact, how the hell can you make a policy? If you cannot provide the specific impact, how the hell can you make a cost-benefit analysis? If you cannot provide the specific impact, how the hell can you measure progress? Senator Pocock has foreshadowed some good amendments, we see, but there's no basis for the actual policy. You can't track the progress without the specific measurement. What is the impact of human carbon dioxide on any climate factor? Nothing at all has ever been provided on that, anywhere in the world.</span>

Senator Macdonald, who was Father of the Senate at the time, in 2016 brought to the Senate's attention that the climate science has never been debated in this chamber. It's never been debated in this chamber and it still isn't being debated. I've challenged Senator Waters many times. I challenged her 12 years ago, in October 2010. She ran from the debate. She would not debate me. I challenged her again in May 2016; she ran from me again. I challenged her here in the Senate. She ran from me and has refused to debate me on either the corruption of climate science or the science. That is fact.</span>

Is the minister aware, for example, that 10 senators and MPs have put in writing the fact that nowhere have they been provided with any evidence from their party or from the parliament? I'll read these names out. These are the names of senators and MPs with character, courage and integrity: Mr Llew O'Brien, Mr Craig Kelly, Mr Kevin Andrews, Mr George Christensen, Mr Bob Katter, Senator Eric Abetz, Senator Connie Fierravanti-Wells, Senator Gerard Rennick, Senator Pauline Hanson and I. We have never been provided at any time in parliament or from their parties with such evidence. Is the minister aware that this bill of hers builds on Prime Minister John Howard's position in complying with the UN's Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and that later on, after he introduced the Renewable Energy Target and stole farmers' property rights through his government, he then said in 2013 that he was agnostic on climate science?

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I want to return to the amendment moved by Senator Waters in this debate. It's a simple amendment seeking to change the emissions targets under this bill. My understanding of this amendment is it would change the 43 per cent target by 2030 to at least 75 per cent by 2030 and also substitute a net-zero target with what is termed here a negative emissions target. My primary question to the Greens, on whose behalf I believe Senator Waters moved this, is: are these increased obligations on Australian businesses and industry matched with reductions that would occur overseas in other countries? Would other countries be expected to match the increased emissions reductions we would make in just the next eight years before we make the same reductions in our industries?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an extremely pertinent question, given what is happening around the world right now and particularly what has happened since the Glasgow conference only last November. Less than a year ago all the rich and well-to-do members of our global society flew on private jets to Glasgow and the surrounds. In fact, the Glasgow Airport was too congested; they had to go to other airports close by. There were that many private jets. There was a flotilla of private jets flying into Scotland. Not since the Spanish Armada had the British Isles been attacked in this way! They flew in and they made all these commitments. We were all told coal is dead and what have you. Less than a year later, European governments are now subsidising follow fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced massive subsidies to people using electricity which comes from gas and coal in the United Kingdom. That's less than a year later, from the German Greens party. May I remind the Australian Greens of this? They don't talk much about this. I used to hear the Australian Greens talk a lot about the German Greens, because I believe their party kind of started in Germany. That's where the first Greens party came from, and I suppose they're just following the German Greens. Soon we can look forward to the Australian Greens reopening coal-fired power stations in this country! But they got their start in Germany. They often mentioned that, but they don't mention them much anymore. They're very silent about their colleagues there on the east side of the Rhine. There, in Germany, the Greens have opened up—or they are opening up; they're in government—21 coal-fired power stations right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the Greens is: is this policy going to make sure it's mandatory that our businesses shut down and reduce their emissions by 75 per cent by 2030 while we sit back and—not even criticise—just let the German government open up coal-fired power stations to keep their petrochemical industries and refineries and smelters going? Is that the plan? How would this plan, which seems unbelievably unfair to Australians and to Australian businesses, in any way help the environment? I think that's what we're all here for or what we're debating here—to apparently reduce emissions to protect the environment. That's the objective of this bill. The objective of this bill is to help reduce the impacts of global climate change and make our contribution in that way. How would adding on this extra burden to Australian businesses, in the context of Europe reopening coal-fired power stations—Italy said only last night that they're reopening coal-fired power stations; Europe is going in the other direction—in any way affect the climate at all, even one iota? And why would we do that to our own businesses and industry?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do give the Greens some leeway here in that at least the United Kingdom government have themselves committed to, I believe, a 68 per cent reduction of emissions or something of that level. Sorry; it's a 78 per cent reduction in emissions by 2035—so it's a little bit later. That's similar to what the Greens are suggesting here. As I say, the United Kingdom are doing nothing to get towards that. They're fracking again and opening up the North Sea et cetera. But that's their target, like the Greens' target of 75 per cent. It's not far off that, albeit five years earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question to the Greens is: what analysis have you done of the impacts of the United Kingdom's 78 per cent target on their own economy, their own business and their own cost structure? A slow-moving disaster is unfolding in the United Kingdom at the moment, at least in part due to their naive and ill-thought-through commitments to net zero emissions and, in this case, particularly, a 78 per cent reduction by 2035. Because of those commitments that they have made in the last few years, the United Kingdom had said no to fracking. They banned fracking right across the British Isles. Because of those commitments, they had refused to release and license new gas exploration areas in the North Sea, which has been for decades the United Kingdom's means of gas and oil access. Because of all those commitments, they have left themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to the aggression of a Russian dictator, and they are now having to take desperate measures just so people can heat their homes over what are brutal winters in the Northern Hemisphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an unbelievable situation when, months away from winter beginning, a developed country cannot guarantee that people will be able to stay warm. At this stage, unless something changes, it is not too dramatic to say that people will almost inevitably die over the European winter, unnecessarily, because of the failed, naive climate change policies that have put Europe in this mess. That is exactly what's happened. They have refused to take sensible decisions to develop their own resources and allow their countries access to reasonable amounts of energy, and now they're in this position where there are not many options available for the United Kingdom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new prime minister, Prime Minister Truss, has already announced that she will cap electricity bills. While that may provide some temporary relief for British residents, it is going to create a whole lot of other problems that have not even been considered yet, No. 1 being cost. The projected cost of this price-capping scheme is estimated at 130 billion pounds—a quarter of a billion Australia dollars—just this winter or this coming year. To put that in context, the United Kingdom's pandemic response—their JobKeeper scheme, which they termed a furlough scheme—'only' cost the British taxpayer $53 billion. The costs of net zero are approaching, and probably will exceed, three times the cost of the pandemic response in the United Kingdom. Has there ever been a more costly, more failed policy than net zero emissions? It is failing and failing so quickly. It's only been a few years since we even heard the term 'net zero emissions'. It was kind of invented over the last decade by some corporate types associated with Richard Branson. It didn't come from the grassroots or any public uprising. It was a corporate plan. Over the last decade, over these 10 years, it has led to utter bankruptcy for what were once proud developed countries. The Australian Greens are saying, 'Let's do that.' Through these amendments, the Australian Greens are saying: 'What's happening over there in the United Kingdom with their 78 per cent target looks fantastic. It looks really, really good. Let's do that here!'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shouldn't we pause here? We should just pause and not go further down this track, which is clearly inflicting enormous pain on the British taxpayer. It is unclear yet how this will actually flow through in the European winter. The United Kingdom government is destroying the price mechanism, which is trying to ration demand given that there's not enough energy. Now they'll destroy that link, and the people won't reduce their power demand because prices won't go up as high. They still will not have enough energy, so it's very unclear what will happen now, whether there'll be blackouts or whether there will have to be mandatory government type restrictions. Indeed, the President of the European Union, Ursula von der Leyen, said last night that they may have to have 'mandatory controls' on energy use, in her words, 'to flatten the curve'. Where have we heard that before?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  It's great to address the chamber on this very important bill. I'd like to address Senator Canavan's concerns about the environment as a result of these renewables because that is what really concerns me about the path that we are taking. If we continue down the path of constantly getting rid of our base-load energy in this country, like coal, and replacing it with wind, solar, lithium batteries and transmission lines, we are going to create an environmental catastrophe. I touched on this last night. It is well known that wind farms kill millions and millions of birds and bats. They kill apex birds. They kill lots and lots of bats. Many people probably don't know that bats, along with bees, are one of the major pollinators in our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got the issue with batteries. Batteries come from rare earth minerals like lithium, for example. Lithium is a one per cent ore body. You have to mine a hundred tonnes of ore to get one tonne of metal. That involves an intensive electrolysis process that in itself requires lots and lots of energy. However, these rare-earths mines—it's just not that simple to go in and get the ore; you have to mine around and around and around. So, quite often you're going to have a stripping ratio of something like 10 to one, so you might have to move 1,000 tonnes of dirt just to end up with one tonne of metal. That metal, after it's been extracted through an extremely energy-intensive process, will then get shipped over to China, where it's put into a car battery, and that car battery is then shipped to the States, where it's put into a Tesla, and then the Tesla comes back to Australia, where basically you have to charge the battery by sticking it into the wall and using energy from coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got solar panels. I just put an article up on my Facebook page this morning about the environmental catastrophe that is going on in California at the moment, and we'll have the same catastrophe here, whereby we'll have dangerous substances leaking from these solar panels once they are taken to the trash. This is concerning, because, as the head of the CSIRO said to me in estimates, it costs three times as much to recycle a lithium battery as it does to actually produce a battery. So, the big concern is, how are we going to afford—and what is the Labor Party going to do about this—recycling all these rare-earths batteries?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we need to touch on is the transmission lines. We are going to have to have hundreds and hundreds of kilometres of transmission lines. The Labor Party have already earmarked a $20 billion Rewiring Australia Fund. But it's not 'rewiring'; it's additional transmission lines that are going to have to connect all these tiny solar panels and windfarms, because these solar panels and windfarms don't produce anywhere near the same amount of energy as a coal-fired power station does. Going back to the nineties, when 70 or 80 per cent of the east coast was powered by coal-fired power, there were only about 30 stations, and only a limited number of transmission lines were needed in order to get the power to the home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, what I really want to do today is address the issue from yesterday, when Senator Wong couldn't actually define what net zero is. I spoke to her about it this morning, and she said, 'Senator Rennick, why do you think so many scientists have all got it wrong?' Well, I don't actually follow scientists. I follow the mathematics behind the science and, in particular, the algorithms that underpin good science. Last night—and I'll do this again, because I can see Senator Chisholm sitting over there with a silly grin on his face—the first scientist I referred to—</span>

                    </a>  You don't believe me? Then take Albert Einstein's word for it, because, at the end of the day, carbon dioxide absorbs and emits photons at only two frequencies. One is at 2.8 microns, which, according to Planck's law, has five times more energy—and that's incoming solar radiation. And the other one is outgoing long-wave radiation at 14.8 microns. The whole point of this discussion is to debunk the junk science behind climate change. I did this last night, but I'll just run you through the five different laws that prove that this disproves climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Number 1 is the first law of thermodynamics: conduction. Basically, all carbon dioxide does is absorb and emit photons that come via the sun. That law is actually Einstein's special theory of relativity, E equals mc squared. As I said last night, he came up with that in 1905. Interestingly enough, he didn't get a Nobel Prize for that. He actually got a Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect, which is one of four papers he wrote in1905. The photoelectric effect impacts the fact that every molecule has a specific vibrational frequency, and it's at that frequency that it can only absorb heat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other law that I used last night was Wien's Law. That describes the frequency at which the CO2 molecule will emit heat. As I pointed out last night, that law says that carbon dioxide only emits heat at 192 degrees Kelvin, which is negative 80 degrees Celsius. So the only place where carbon dioxide will actually release heat is either at the bottom of Antarctica or about 10 kilometres up in the troposphere. This matters because this disproves the science; the science is bogus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll continue. What I have here is an energy budget from the Australian Academy of Science. They want you to believe that downwelling radiation averages on a 24-hour period over 342 watts per square metre. Funnily enough, the CSIRO says that the downwelling radiation from CO2 is 333 watts per square metre. That is a difference of nine watts per square meter. What does that tell you? These guys can't measure downwelling radiation. They can't even measure it. We're told the science is settled, but they can't even measure it. Guess what? The IPCC says that the increase in downwelling radiation since 1750, from the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, is only two watts per square metre. Get this. Their error in measurements has a margin of error of 400 per cent. You can't even properly measure what it is you're supposed to be spending billions of dollars on. How is that going to work? Not too well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the other crazy thing. They want you to believe that the downwelling radiation from carbon dioxide is actually stronger than the incoming solar radiation from the sun. That's absurd. As we know from Plank's law from 1902, solar radiation effectively has a higher frequency of about up to 100 times in the ultraviolet range and the visible light range—the visible light range is about 30 times stronger than 14.8 microns in the infrared range. They want you to believe that infrared has more energy than ultraviolet and visible light. This stuff is pathetic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the real doozy. What's missing in this energy budget, people? I will tell you what it is. I'll give you a bit of a clue here. A bloke by the name of Isaac Newton hypothesised this back in the 16th or 17th century. That, of course, is gravity. These guys want you to think that photons aren't influenced by the gravity of the earth, which happens to be 5.6 trillion billion tonnes. They seem to think that that's not going to have a pull on a photon. So the whole thing is totally debunked. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the minister is: why are there 40 different models to calculate net zero, if the science is settled? That came from the head of the CSIRO, who said there were 40 different models used to calculate net zero. The science is not settled if the head of the CSIRO in this country says there are 40 different models. Which model are we going to use here in Australia, and how do we know there isn't going to be arbitrage with the different models between different countries to exploit the confusion in climate change and to milk Australia dry? </span>

But he's asked particularly what's been provided to him in this chamber, and it has been engaged with on many occasions in the chamber as well. With the agreement of the Senate I would like to table just one contribution, which is a speech I made in 2016, funnily enough in response to a request from Senator Roberts that we put the science on the record. On that occasion I read through the names of the 20 most cited peer-reviewed papers about climate change and its effects, which was compiled by Thomson Reuters. I made the observation at that time that there were, in 2013, 4,000 papers that expressed a view on climate change. There are vast quantities of scientific information available to Senator Roberts; the problem is that Senator Roberts cares not to engage with them. That is the problem with this argument. There is nothing that can be provided in response to this request for more information that will ever satisfy Senator Roberts.</span>

                    </a>  No wonder it has taken a Labor government to land a climate policy and an energy policy. The previous government was so racked by division and dysfunction, so unable to agree amongst themselves, that nothing was ever able to be done, and the cost of that is being felt by the Australian people. It's being felt by an energy market that is experiencing real challenges. It's also the opportunity cost of the jobs in regional Australia, a part of Australia that the National Party claim to be so concerned about, for young people leaving school now which might have been developed in new industries or for the future that were stymied, not developed, because of inaction and uncertainty. Time after time business came before us and said: 'What we're looking for is certainty. What we're after is a clear policy that will let us make final investment decisions and let us plan for the transformation of our businesses to meet a low-carbon future.' So little of that was possible, so much of it impeded, by the chaos, division and dysfunction, and it's why the bill that's before us matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment before the Chair from Senator Waters seeks to change the target. I don't think it will come as a surprise to Senator Waters that we will not be supporting this amendment, and I want to step through why. We have a mandate for the targets proposed in this bill. They are ambitious targets, and they are responsible targets. It's a policy we sought a mandate for during the election. We have talked about it after the election and consulted further with our community, and we will be sticking with that policy. It's a mandate we respect. It is a significant step up in our ambition. It is an achievable and responsible contribution to global efforts to keep to 1.5 degrees of warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The net zero by 2050 target is consistent with the Paris Agreement global temperature goal to hold the global temperature increase to well below two degrees and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1½ degrees. The bill does emphasise the importance of climate science. Its object clause refers to the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. It requires that the Climate Change Authority's advice to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy on targets must explain how the targets have taken into account the matters set out in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, including the global temperature goals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As set out in clause 10 of the bill, this is a floor in Australia's emissions reduction ambition, and not a ceiling. Our aspiration is that the commitments of industry, states and territories and the Australian people will yield even greater emissions reductions in the coming decade. The Australian government outlined in its updated nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, on 16 June 2022, that this is our approach. And, in addition, each successive target must be more ambitious than the last, as required by the Paris Agreement. The government must consider independent advice from the Climate Change Authority prior to making each new nationally determined contribution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding—and I expect Senator Waters wishes to make another contribution—I will just respond to her question about the way that the government deals with proposed projects in the oil, coal and gas sectors. Essentially, there are, as you have observed, a range of projects that proponents have flagged as possible projects in the future, and they are at different stages of development. As you all know, the economics of resource projects are changing. The projections that are developed by the Australian government are regularly updated. They incorporate the emissions associated with the anticipated demand for Australian exports, and that is something that is updated on a regular basis. </span>

                    </a>  I withdraw this truth. In 2022 to be trying to debunk climate science in 10 minutes is why Australians are so frustrated. The arguments we're hearing are about increasing Russian gas prices, which is thanks to the two major parties not actually having good policy in place to prioritise Australians, and that's why we're actually subject to export prices. Let's keep that in mind when we hear the talk of Russia: we don't import gas from Russia. Why are we subjected to those prices? We've heard about how 43 per cent is ambitious, yet there's modelling showing that, if you add up all of the states and territories' commitments, that potentially gets us to 42 per cent. If one per cent is ambitious, I think Australians are going to be asking questions. </span>

In Australia we don't have a cap-and-trade framework, and these reductions in emissions will come from more targeted policies. With this complexity, there's the potential for uncertainty around investment decisions, particularly investment in renewable energy. I'd like to ask the minister: is the government prepared to consider a process that would set out the emissions reductions expected of each sector? </span>

I'm happy to confirm that this government is not scared of accountability in providing detailed information on our emissions and policies across sectors. Under paragraph 12(1)(d) of the bill the effectiveness of the Commonwealth's policies in reducing emissions in the sectors covered by each policy must be included in the annual statement, and the government will meet this requirement. For example, the safeguard mechanism has a particular focus on reducing industrial and fugitive emissions. Our national inventory reports, quarterly updates and the official projections of emissions under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement already detail sectoral emissions. For example, our last quarterly report, released last week, found that, for the last full year of the previous government, emissions for the year to March 2022 are estimated to be 487.1 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1½ per cent increase in emissions over the year to March reflects annual increases in emissions from stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and agriculture sectors. The report details the emissions of each of these sectors as well as electricity waste, industrial processes and land sectors. Our official projections look at changes in these sectoral emissions over time and at our challenge of reversing the decade of inaction, secrecy and denial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sectoral emissions and projected changes will also be clear in the annual climate change statements. We are already working with the policy frameworks for key sectors, such as our National Electric Vehicle Strategy and National Energy Transformation Partnership with the states and territories. The issue of sectoral emissions will also be a key issue for the Climate Change Authority's advice on future targets, including the 2035 target.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the minister for almost answering my questions, but I'm going to have some more questions about this. There are 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline, and I did ask whether or not the modelling that underpinned the 43 per cent target, which I understand was prepared by RepuTex, factored in those 114. My understanding is the answer is no, but I think the minister actually shared some information about departmental modelling for future coal export demand. So my first question is for the minister to explain what question she thought she was answering and for her to then answer my actual question.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some supplementaries as I fear the diatribe of climate denialism will resume if I sit down. So I'll ask all of my questions whilst I have the call, lest I not have an opportunity in the future. The International Energy Agency, in their <span style="font-style:italic;">Coal 2021</span> report, showed that Australia has more new coal export mines than anywhere else in the world. So I want to know how the government thinks it can meet the 43 per cent target while opening these new coalmines? I note that the New South Wales and Queensland governments have approved three coalmines since this bill passed the House of Representatives, and I'd like to ask whether the government intends to reject approval for those coalmines?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that BHP has just put in an application to run a coalmine until—I don't even know how to say it!—2113, which is insane. How is that consistent with the government's climate bills? So I'm really keen for the minister to respond to how on earth we have a chance of meeting this inadequate target whilst opening and considering opening 114 new coal and gas projects.</span>

                    </a>  I want to note that I'm flattered by the questions from the opposition about cost of living and global progress. I fear they're actually not genuinely asking for me to respond, but the answer, of course, is that if we don't act on the climate crisis the cost of living will absolutely dwarf everything else—as every thinking person understands. This bill does not even get us close to the Paris Agreement, so it is clear that Australia is a global laggard. So with that done, Minister, I'm interested in using the committee stage for its appropriate purpose.</span>

This is an issue that has been well litigated inside this chamber and outside of it, but I will go through our approach again. Business, industry and investors all say the same thing: domestically, we need to upgrade the transmission, upgrade the grid and inject more firmed renewables. The government agree that this is what is required. We are not unrealistic about the role of gas in our energy mix. We understand that gas plays an important part in powering communities by firming and peaking electricity, and as a feed source and a source of heat for industry and for manufacturers. Any new large-scale coal or gas project will automatically come under the remit of Labor's reformed safeguard mechanism. This is the way that we will be reducing the emissions of Australia's biggest emitters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not an overstatement to say that this is a workplace entitlement that will save lives. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While family and domestic violence affects everyone in our community, it impacts on women most severely. First Nations women, younger women, women with disability, and women in remote and regional areas in particular face acute and significant challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The facts set out by the Fair Work Commission in its recent review are frightening. Since the age of 15, approximately one in four women experienced violence by an intimate partner. First Nations women are 32 times as likely to be hospitalised due to family and domestic violence than non-Indigenous women. On average, one woman is killed by her current or former partner every ten days in Australia. The prevalence of family and domestic violence has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Family and domestic violence devastates the lives and livelihoods of those who directly experience it; and its damaging impacts reverberate throughout our communities, our workplaces, and our national economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unacceptably, rates of family and domestic violence are not declining in Australia. For many women, the most dangerous place in Australia is her home, and this must change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is putting forward this Bill because as a nation we can and must do better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An urgent, whole-of-community response is required, and workplaces have a key role to play as a source of critical support for people experiencing family and domestic violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Frontline workers have told us that there are two issues at the forefront of the minds of women seeking to escape from violent relationships. First, they are worried about disruption to the lives of their children. Second, they are worried about disruption to their income and employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More than 68% of people experiencing family and domestic violence are in paid work. However, many can't leave violent situations without risking joblessness, financial stress, homelessness and poverty, leaving workers having to choose between their safety and their livelihood. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Getting out is hard, really hard. Reporting is hard, really hard—and turning up to court can be another trauma altogether. This Bill makes everything just that bit easier. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Getting out will still be hard. But it will be less likely that getting out makes you unemployed or poor. People in family and domestic violence situations have enough challenges already. This Bill says you will no longer have to ask "can I afford to be safe". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill sends a clear message that family and domestic violence is not just a criminal justice or social issue, but an economic and a workplace issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Frontline workers have told us that leaving violent relationships costs time and costs money. People leaving relationships often become sole parents; they have to find a new place to live and new schools for their children. People often leave a relationship with just the clothes on their backs, and have to start from scratch to build a new life. The economic impact on these workers and their families is nothing short of devastating. Paid leave provides the financial support and employment security these individuals so urgently need to help them leave dangerous situations safely and rebuild their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The principle behind this paid leave entitlement is simple—getting out shouldn't mean losing pay. Normally, leave entitlements are at the base rate of pay. But applying the principle that getting out shouldn't mean losing pay requires a different approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new leave entitlement will be paid at the rate people would have received had they not taken leave, not just at their base rate of pay. Once in place, the 10 days' leave will be provided upfront, allowing immediate access to the full entitlement from commencement of employment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In its review of family and domestic leave, the Fair Work Commission recognised that family and domestic violence erodes women's access to work, career progression and financial independence. By reducing these negative impacts, paid family and domestic violence leave will help to reduce the gender pay gap, support gender equality, and increase women's economic security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An increasing number of employers—both large and small—are already providing a range of support to their employees experiencing family and domestic violence leave, including access to paid leave. All states and territories now provide their employees with access to paid leave to deal with family and domestic violence. These efforts are to be commended. This Bill will enshrine family and domestic violence leave as a minimum employment standard for all, ensuring that wherever you work and whoever your employer is, you will be guaranteed access to this lifesaving entitlement if you need it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This entitlement will be enshrined in the National Employment Standards and cover up to 11 million employees. It will be a lifeline when women most need it, allowing workers to take necessary steps to stay safe, while retaining their jobs and their income. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Normally casual employees do not have access to paid leave. But applying the test—"getting out shouldn't mean losing pay"—takes you to a different conclusion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill provides a paid entitlement to family and domestic violence leave for all employees, including casuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently 2.6 million casual employees in Australia. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Family and domestic violence doesn't pick and choose based on whether you are a permanent or casual worker. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Casuals are not spared from family and domestic violence. In fact, women who are experiencing or have experienced family and domestic violence have a more disrupted work history, and are more likely to be employed in casual work, than women with no experience of violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Casuals are already dealing with the consequences of being in insecure work and are unable to access other forms of paid leave, making them more vulnerable when they are dealing with the impact of domestic violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Bill, casual employees will be paid for rostered shifts, including where a shift has been offered and accepted, providing employers with certainty about the rate of payment for casual employees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Employees facing family and domestic violence will no longer have to ask—"do I have leave to help me get out?"—the answer for every employee will now be "yes". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be no gap for any employees who are not eligible for this paid leave entitlement. Casuals who are not rostered will still be entitled to be absent from work without pay for 10 days per year to deal with the impacts of family and domestic violence, without having to worry about losing their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are increasingly living in more diverse living situations. First Nations families and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities also have familial responsibilities, households, and relationships that must be captured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Violence can be and is perpetrated by unrelated people who live in the same household. In a tragic recent example, a woman at the Sunshine Coast was killed, allegedly at the hands of her unrelated housemate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People increasingly live separately to their intimate partners; young people in particular. The amendments made to the definition of family and domestic violence will ensure that violent or abusive behaviour in intimate relationships—whether or not the partners cohabit—will also be captured, and employees can take paid leave to seek necessary assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some might suggest that these additions broaden the definition too much. During the two extensive hearings on family and domestic violence leave conducted by the Fair Work Commission, there was no evidence whatsoever of any misuse of paid family and domestic violence leave. This is just not an entitlement that employees rort. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unless we include intimate partners in this way, we are left with a situation where a person suffering violence or abuse at the hands of an intimate partner needs to move in with their abuser in order to access paid family and domestic violence leave to seek assistance. This would be an absurd outcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People experiencing violence in their home or at the hands of an intimate partner should have access to paid leave to escape or deal with such situations, and the changes made to the definition of family and domestic violence will ensure this is the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Employers are bearing the significant costs of family and domestic violence leave in the form of reduced productivity caused by absenteeism, recruitment and retraining costs. The costs to the national economy are huge, with estimates ranging between $12.6 and $22 billion per year, with the cost to employers being about $2 billion per year. Paid family and domestic violence will assist to reduce this cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that business will need some lead-in time to adjust their payroll systems to ensure this entitlement can be provided confidentially and appropriately to employees. The Government recognises that small businesses face a number of unique challenges. They often have lower cash flow and lack the sophisticated human resources capacity to administer this new leave entitlement and manage associated sensitive issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Support for small businesses is essential. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has consulted with business representatives on implementation. To assist business, the entitlement will have a phased commencement, with most businesses having around 6 months from the date of introduction, and small businesses will be afforded an additional 6 months to prepare. We will also be consulting on a package of implementation support measures for small business to assist with rolling out this entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a fair question to ask why the government is providing these lead times for business. Truth is, we wish the starting date was years ago rather than next year. But we need to ensure the entitlement is understood by workers and employers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We don't want a worker being refused leave simply because the employer didn't understand the new entitlement. We want there to be a chance for business to work through essential principles such as, how to describe this on a payslip without using terms that could make an awful situation worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We will work with businesses, large and small, so they will be equipped to have a sensitive conversation with their employee, understand their obligations, and have appropriate mechanisms and payroll practices in place to sensitively manage leave information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Gender equity, women's safety and women's economic security are at the heart of this Government's agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are serious about tackling family and domestic violence in Australia. In addition to paid family and domestic violence leave, our commitment includes measures to bring about long-term cultural change to tackle entrenched discriminatory attitudes and behaviours, as well as ensuring supports are in place to help people safely leave abusive situations. We are establishing a new Family, Domestic and Sexual Violence Commission; investing $77 million in high quality consent and respectful relationships education in schools; and delivering more safe and affordable housing to assist women fleeing violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is an important part of that framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government might be introducing this Bill—but it didn't start with us. This Bill is the result of the tireless efforts of frontline workers, unions and gender equity advocates who have been campaigning for this entitlement for close to 15 years. In 2009, a group of experts from the Domestic Violence Clearing House at the University of New South Wales approached the trade union movement in NSW to discuss the possibility of a ground-breaking new paid leave entitlement to help workers impacted by family and domestic violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge and thank one of those experts, Ludo McFerran, for her vision and her leadership on this issue over the past 15 years. Ludo drafted the first ever paid family and domestic violence clause. That first clause did not get up, but it set in train a nation-wide community and union campaign—a campaign which ends here today with this Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2010, the Australian Services Union and the Surf Coast Shire Council in Victoria negotiated a collective agreement providing access to 20 days paid family and domestic violence leave for staff of the Council. As far as we know this was the very first example of this kind of entitlement anywhere in the world. Linda White was the Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Services Union at the time of this ground-breaking achievement, and is now a Labor Senator for Victoria. We acknowledge and thank her for the key role she has played in the development of this life-saving entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the first clause was negotiated in 2010, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and its affiliates, including the Australian Services Union, which represents frontline family and domestic violence workers has led a national campaign to have the entitlement rolled out in more and more workplaces; with the mutual benefits for workers and employers increasingly recognised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">About 1.13 million employees now have access to paid family and domestic violence leave through collective bargaining between workers and employers. This legislation will take the figure from just over 1 million employees, to 11 million employees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We would like to acknowledge our incredible frontline workforce who strive day-in and day-out to support and assist individuals and families impacted by violence; including our paramedics, doctors, nurses, police officers, community legal centre lawyers, educators and community sector workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We also acknowledge those in our community who have lost their lives due to family and domestic violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We recognise those we've lost, those who've survived, and those who still feel trapped. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is for you. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You have asked us to do more to help and we are here now getting this done for you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will not by itself solve the problem of family and domestic violence; but it does mean no employee in Australia will ever again be forced to make a choice between earning a wage and protecting the safety of themselves and their families.</span>

I have three very simple questions, one that leads from the other. It has been reported through Climate Analytics and Climate Council and widely reported in the media that the ALP's 2030 target of a 43 per cent emissions reduction is consistent with two degrees of warming globally. Do you agree with that characterisation, Minister?</span>

We've been very clear that the targets that we have adopted put us on a path to meet our Paris objective commitments. As you understand, the Paris Agreement asks the world to contain warming to less than two degrees and to leave open the possibility of containing it to 1½ degrees.</span>

My colleague Mehreen Faruqi said publicly that your target failed the Paris Agreement. That was fact checked by AAP, who found that she was indeed correct, that your 43 per cent target is consistent with two degrees of warming, which is above the 1½ to well below two degrees of warming that is the Paris target. I'm going to assume that the two degrees is uncontroversial.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, my second question to you is: do you also agree with the IPCC forecasts first released in November 2018? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change differentiated between 1½ degrees and two degrees in their impact on the ocean. It said that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees would likely be the difference between the survival of the Great Barrier Reef coral and its complete decline, according to the United Nations assessment of the climate science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report basically said that if global warming reaches two degrees, which is consistent with your target, more than 99 per cent of coral reefs were projected to decline this century, and indeed an annual bleaching event was expected on the Great Barrier Reef and the world's coral reefs. Minister, do you agree with the science and that characterisation by the IPCC? </span>

We are committed to the Paris Agreement. We are not only committed to reflecting those commitments in our own approach to policy here in Australia, but we are committed to participating in the global conversation to make sure that the world can reach those objectives because there is no disagreement between us on the questions you raise. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A warming world is dangerous for people and damaging to ecosystems. We have to do everything we can, as a country and as a globe, to contain warming. The Paris Agreement gives us the best chance of doing that. You will know better than I that the world has been through stops and starts in our ability to generate global momentum. It mattered a great deal to strike the agreement that was struck in Paris, and it matters, too, that at Glasgow the level of ambition globally was increased. It matters that businesses in Australia are being encouraged by investors globally to set their own targets. There is a momentum towards change and there is more that is going to need to be done.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, Senator Whish-Wilson, I think where you are really going to is a question about our target. And I've answered that question already in response to questions from Senator Waters. We went to the election and sought a mandate, and we did it in a particular context. We did it in an environment where this country, under the government of those who now sit opposite, was unable to land an energy policy and unable to land a climate policy for nine years—a period in which almost nothing was done by the Commonwealth government on decarbonisation, where the heavy lifting was left to other people, to local communities, to businesses, to states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to an election and receiving a mandate, a wide mandate, to begin a process of change led by the Commonwealth is no small thing. You may think it's a small thing, and that's fine for the Greens. But for a party that seeks to be the party of government, taking a commitment to the election, having it scrutinised in the context of an election, having it debated with those opposite—who, as we've seen this morning, want to deny the science and want to dispute the objective of net zero emissions, as Senator Canavan did—means something. And it means something to walk into a room and to update your nationally determined contribution in the presence of AIG, the ACTU, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Clean Energy Council. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building consensus, and bringing people with you, matters. We have a mandate for the target that is embedded in this legislation. We are pursuing the policies that we took to the election. That is actually more important than you appear to be willing to acknowledge.</span>

In response, at the end of her last contribution, the leader of the Australian Greens said she was flattered by the question, but she declined to answer. All I asked was what modelling, if any, existed. None has been provided, so I can only assume there is absolutely no regard for what impact this would have on household budgets. I presume that is the standard that we are now setting. We will just focus on one side of the equation and not the other.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made the point earlier on, and I think it's not an unreasonable one, that in every decision we make we should balance the economy and the environment, which are two very fragile things. We would never make a decision purely on economic grounds, and nor should we ever. The days of those decisions are long gone, thankfully, but we should balance those decisions. The Greens do need to be held to account for such propositions. They aren't the party of government—and I hope they never will be. But when you come in here and try to alter legislation which, I believe, will have a very negative impact on something as simple as household power bills, you should answer the questions being asked about the amendment being put forward. I know that no modelling has been done. They refuse the answer the question. Let that be known publicly. So I will then ask the minister: what modelling has been done on the impact on household power prices of your 43 per cent target?</span>

There are a couple of things. Senator Duniam, the 75 per cent target is not controversial. It's been modelled by the IPCC. It's well recognised that that is what is necessary for us to meet the Paris targets. This goes directly to this debate that we're having here today and this amendment before the chair that was put by Senator Waters. Seventy-five per cent is not controversial. And I wonder whether you have modelled the impact on power prices of the climate emergency in the next 20 or 30 years, from extreme heatwaves and extreme cold and floods. I bet you haven't thought about the cost of inaction, have you? Anyway, I do digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to get back to my question to the minister. Minister, we also have a mandate—the Australian Greens. We have the balance of power in the Senate because millions of Australians voted for real climate action. It's entirely legitimate for us to be in here fighting for our mandate, as it is for Senator Pocock, for the people who voted for us and for climate action and the one in three Australians who now vote outside the two major parties. It might seem like a small thing, 1½ to two degrees. But Minister, I'm confused about your response here today. Regarding your target of 43 per cent, regardless of whether you feel you have a mandate for that—that's not the issue before the chair—the question is: does 43 per cent equate to an ambition of limiting global warming to two degrees this century? It clearly does. Two degrees is different to 1½ degrees. In fact, all the things we've seen, especially in the past decade—the extreme weather events we've seen in Australia, the fires, the floods, back-to-back bleachings on the Great Barrier Reef, a bleaching during a La Nina year, record La Nina weather in the past nine months—are all happening on one degree of warming above preindustrial levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about trying to hold that to 1½ degrees. To put that in perspective, that is 50 per cent warmer than the planet is right now. Your bill here today will double the amount of warming captured in this atmosphere this century—a 100 per cent increase. An ambition of 43 per cent by 2030 means a 100 per cent increase in warming on this planet. So, the difference between 1½ and two degrees is so material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question to you is, do you agree with the IPCC assessment that if we can't limit warming to 1½ degrees then we will see an annual bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef and the loss of 99 per cent of the world's corals probably in our lifetime? That's how serious this is. This is not climate ambition. This is not what I've been fighting for in this place for the past nine years, during the swamp and desert years of the LNP, as they sat back and watched the fire burn the house down. This is not the climate ambition that Australians voted for. So we need to be very clear here. Why, Minister, are you, for example, opening up 46,000 square kilometres of new ocean acreage to oil and gas companies to explore for the exact product that, when they burn it, is killing our oceans and warming our planet and condemning future generations on this planet? Can you please explain to me—and I'm asking this in relation to the second reading amendment that was moved last night in here by my colleague Senator Shoebridge—why you are opening up new areas of ocean to oil and gas exploration in a time of climate emergency while you are trying to limit emissions and Australia's emissions ambition?</span>

You asked a specific question about acreage release, and I will answer that, perhaps by saying that we're fully committed to delivering on our 2030 and 2050 climate targets. It's why we're here today and it's why we're debating it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The release of offshore areas for greenhouse gas storage and petroleum exploration is an annual process. While we are quickly scaling up renewables, other forms of energy, such as gas and oil, continue to play a part in our energy mix. Our approach is to reduce emissions while growing the economy and supporting key industries, and we are working with industry as a partner on our journey. We understand that gas is not a low-emissions fuel, but it does play an important part in helping to power communities by firming and peaking electricity and as a feedstock and source of heat for industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, we understand the changing and reduced role that fossil fuels, like gas, will play in a decarbonising global economy. But the truth is that the best way to drive down emissions is with policy certainty, and that is the purpose of the legislation that is before us today.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  Firstly, Minister, I agree with you that there is evidence of confusion besetting the coalition. It has been doing so since John Howard's prime ministership in the early 2000s, when he changed his mind on climate and later admitted that he was agnostic on the climate science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I will be reading your papers yet again, but let me ask you—because you have still not answered—what is the specific quantified effect of carbon dioxide from human activity on any climate factor? I would like to know that number. That is fundamental to the basis of any policy or legislation. No-one has provided it anywhere in the world. This is your bill. You need to provide it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I only need that specific, quantified effect of carbon dioxide from human activity. If you provide it and it's accurate, then I'll be silent. This issue long ago became a matter not of science or of the environment; it became a matter of integrity. We've got hypocritical parasitic billionaires doing a reverse Robin Hood, stealing via a highly regressive tax from the poor and the vulnerable—and you endorse that. We've got a Paris Agreement that is not an agreement. In the Paris Agreement they agreed that each country would do whatever it wanted to do. China said, 'Up yours; we're not doing anything!' India said the same. But Australia said, 'We will gut our economy.' And now you're going to ramp it up even further.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like your view on this, Minister. Senator Whish-Wilson said that his party has a mandate. Mandates do not supplant science. Mandates based on positions that are based on lies are not mandates. Until you provide this Senate and the people of Australia with the specific quantified effect of carbon dioxide from human activity on the climate, or any climate or weather factor, you will not have a mandate.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. The late Maurice Strong was the first Director-General of the United Nations Environment Program, a position that he created for himself after he formed the UN Environment Program. He became the first Secretary-General later on that year, in 1972. Maurice Strong is the concoctor of climate alarm. After forming the IPCC in 1988—at his instigation—he wanted to create an aura of scientific endorsement. Never has the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provided any specific quantified effect of carbon dioxide from human activity on climate—never! He created an aura of scientific endorsement. He entrenched climate alarm through fermenting the staged illusion of grassroots movements and UN conferences, including Rio in 1992, which formed Agenda 21; Kyoto in 1997, which formed the UN Kyoto protocol; and Paris in 2015, just after he died.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, Strong built systems to drive behaviour and enrich himself. Maurice Strong formed and part owned the Chicago Climate Exchange for global trading of carbon dioxide credits. Al Gore invested in that. In 2007 Kevin Rudd, as Labor leader and predecessor to the current Prime Minister, brought Gore to Australia to peddle climate alarm with the intention of starting Labor's emissions trading scheme, involving carbon dioxide credits that would ultimately be traded on Maurice Strong and Gore's Chicago Climate Exchange.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Separately, law enforcement agencies have reportedly sought Strong for alleged serious criminal charges and then reportedly he exiled himself in China. This is the man who created climate alarm. This is the man on who your policies are based. Strong had been the under-secretary-general of the United Nations and used that position to push unfounded climate alarm via the United Nations and later combined with the World Economic Forum. He was the founding executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, responsible for the deaths of 40 to 50 million people from malaria when the United Nations Environment Program drove the ban on the insecticide DDT, and did so contrary to the science. That man had a track record of contradicting the science, vilifying the science, usurping the science and then claiming the science. He's basically been responsible for the deaths of millions of people and now wants to impoverish the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He made two stated aims of his life. His first was to put in place an unelected socialist global governance, which we can see the evidence of almost daily around the world and particularly in this country. His second objective was to deindustrialise Western civilisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The senior level of many of the leaders of the United Nations have said that they want to put in place a new world order. That's what this is about. It is about control of energy, control of property, control of water, control of resources. It's control of society through the United Nations environmental program and then through the United Nations Agenda 21. Are you aware of these facts, Minister?</span>

I haven't made a contribution to this, but I asked a couple of questions of the Greens, of Senator Waters and the amendment she moved. Very briefly and quickly the questions were: is there any escape clause, if you like, for Australia if other countries don't act and reduce their emissions to the proposed 75 per cent? Can we not go through with it or are we locked in? The other question was: why are the Greens expecting a different outcome in Australia than in the UK, who have committed to a 78 per cent reduction by 2035—a very similar target—and are in a complete and utter mess right now, at least in part thanks to that target?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only have I not received answers to those questions; the leader of the Greens in the Senate, Senator Waters, had the temerity to stand up and dismiss it and say, 'We don't need to answer that, because this is about a government bill.' She's too good to answer questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's very important to point out that the Australian Greens are very good at asking for transparency and information from other groups, from the government and from us when we are in government, but when the shoe's on the other foot and they are moving an amendment and seeking to change our nation's laws—it's their proposal, not anyone else's—they refuse to answer basic questions about their own proposal. If nothing else, that is why we should vote this down, because they are not a responsible political party. This is clearly a stunt from Senator Waters, not a sensible and realistic attempt to change these laws, because she won't even answer basic questions about her proposals. I give respect: at least the government minister has answered a number of questions in this place through this committee process. But this is a committee of the whole; it's not a committee just to look after the government. It's not Senate estimates. It's a committee of the whole. If you are going to come into the committee of the whole and move amendments, you should be expected to answer questions about the amendments you are moving. If you can't answer those questions, we certainly should say no to this amendment. That's what we should do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I briefly want to take issue also with the many interjections—the remarks might have been in contributions, but at least in interjections—saying, 'You're just in the pockets of the fossil fuel companies.' Apparently we're all funded by the fossil fuel companies. We all know, don't we, that there's no money in renewable energy! No-one makes any money out of renewable energy! It's all a charitable act! We know all the companies in the renewable energy space, and they're all doing it out of the goodness of their hearts! They don't make money, they don't have dividends, they don't have shareholders—it's all just charity! I just want to pay tribute and respect to all of those hardworking Australian investors out there who are building wind turbines and putting up solar farms and don't expect anything in return! They don't expect anything! All those people importing solar panels made from Uighur slave labour—they're good, charitable organisations! I will not stand here and have a word said against them!</span>

                    </a>  Actually, I think the difference between us and them is that when senior people on that side said, 'We will try to resolve the debate,' my people did the right thing. Whereas, on your side, when your people say that you are going to try to move to the next amendment, you all jump. I understand there's a lot of division inside your party room. Can I make this point: this is a debate where people have very different views. I accept that and I respect that. I disagree fundamentally with the position Senator Canavan puts. Nothing I say will change his mind, and nothing he says will change mine. We do have some new crossbenchers in here, including Senator Pocock, who do wish to have the opportunity to move their amendments and speak to them. So I would ask the opposition and the crossbench—</span>

We support these amendments, which improve the Climate Change Bill and are consistent with our intention to both legislate the targets and make the government accountable for meeting them. We consider that the risks to Australia from the impacts of climate change are real. We have to reduce emissions to avoid the worse of these impacts. But we're already living with the impacts of climate change, and making progress on climate adaptation is one of the key issues that I will be progressing for the government. The amendments also ensure that the authority must consult on climate change statements, while recognising that consultation for this year is difficult in the time available. They also ensure that the authority's advice on the annual statement is not hidden when the statement is delivered to the parliament. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we also support the amendment that you have circulated on sheet 1620 in relation to the prescribed functions of ARENA. We established ARENA when last in government to support renewable energy, and we have opposed numerous attempts by the previous government first to abolish ARENA and then to make regulations to force ARENA to invest in the then government's pet projects such as fossil fuel based hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Your amendments are important in clarifying the functions of that organisation. More broadly, we thank you for your engagement—or I should say, through the Chair, we thank Senator Pocock for his engagement with us and his work to improve the bills. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, when I look at the nationally determined contribution, which was changed, rightfully, on your government winning the election and having a mandate to change our ambition as a nation on climate change, one of the first things you did was remove from that document a five-yearly review of the impacts of our climate ambition on rural and regional Australia. We have heard time and time again, in the inquiry and in this place and out in our communities, that, yes, on a pathway to net zero by 2050 there will be opportunities for our communities and our industries. But you're kidding yourselves if you don't think there are going to be challenges for these industries and these communities. It is not just the National Party that is saying it; it's the union movement as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of our role as legislators is to think about, when we implement these policies, making sure we mitigate some of the negative impacts on those communities. We all know who they are, and we all know where they are. It is why our government, in securing a pathway to net zero, combined that with over $20 billion of new money to support these communities, to seize the opportunities that a pathway to net zero by 2050 would bring, but to help them overcome the challenges. You are choosing to legislate your target, which you didn't have to do. You yourselves have admitted that it is unnecessary and largely symbolic. It'll cause a whole heap of unintended consequences, and I outlined some of those in my speech last night in the second reading debate. But, in setting that ambitious target without putting in place significant support and programs and projects to support rural and regional communities, you're setting them up to fail and you are causing an incredible amount of stress and concern in our mining communities, our agriculture communities and our manufacturing communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to you—and I have a range of them—is: why did you remove the five-yearly clause that we got written in so that future governments, before they update our nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, have actual data, not just on the benefits but on the impact? Even if you look at Europe and what they're going through at the moment, it's not all going to be plain sailing, so we need to be cognisant and aware of that so we can assist our communities on this journey.</span>

I find myself unable to agree with your characterisation of the regime that is being legislated. The Paris Agreement in fact requires signatories to update their contributions every five years; it is baked into the Paris Agreement. The regime that we are implementing requires government to seek independent advice on every occasion, in each of those five-year intervals, when we seek to update our agreement. So it meets the objective that you establish, which is that the benefits and impacts of the targets that are adopted by the Australian government be independently considered and advice be provided, both to the minister and publicly. That is the nature of the regime that is being proposed in the bill before you today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most curious, though, about this is that when a specific proposition was put in the other place, your colleagues in the Liberal and National parties not only voted against it but called for a division so they would be on the record as voting against the amendments that were put in the other place to ensure that the interests of rural and regional communities were considered in that advice. I find that very strange, actually almost incomprehensible. So, yes, we do think that regional economic development is important, and our policies are expected to result in an additional 604,000 jobs to 2030, with five out of six of those jobs being in the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is harder to understand is why the National Party and the Liberal Party teamed up in the other place to prevent an examination of those issues in the reports provided by the Climate Change Authority to the parliament. </span>

Somebody had to come in and help the Albanese government appreciate that their ambition was going to impact the regions. You needed to just check with the AWU. They would have been very, very happy to tell you what that impact would have been. You raced off to update our nationally determined contribution, and I'm happy to table your 2022 change to our NDC where you explicitly remove what we had put in, which was the five-yearly updated review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You stand up here today and you make an argument like it was all Albo's and Bowen's kind of plan the whole time to make sure that the impact on rural and regional Australia would be part of your plan, but it wasn't. Getting the climate authority to do this and only look at the benefits is the concern that mining communities—Labor towns—around the country have with your bill. A much more rigorous, authentic and genuine way to address that concern would be to have a five-yearly review by the Productivity Commission. If you were serious about actually genuinely understanding the impact, and therefore ponying up on levels of support for those communities, then you would be supporting our amendment around the Productivity Commission. I think it's the height of cheek to come into this chamber and make out like it was always the Labor Party's plan, because it wasn't. If you read what you put forward in our nationally determined contribution, there is no mention of a review and there is no mention of analysis specific to rural and regional communities, and that's just a fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question to you is: given that the impact is unquestionable, the desire to move on a pathway to net zero by 2050 is occurring, what guarantee will rural and regional Australians have in your October budget around the programs that our government put in place to support those communities around the country—over $21 billion of new money? What guarantee do those communities have that your government recognises that there will be benefits and challenges for different places in our country?</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there may be changes in some communities. No-one denies that. And had Liberal members of your government decided to attend the Jobs and Skills Summit, they would have observed a very extended discussion between a range of stakeholders about the way that we will support communities to transition. At least part of that response lies in the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, which will provide various forms of support for new jobs and industries with a focus, in part, on clean technology and with a strong focus on regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the actual consequence of the policy settings that have been in place for the last nine years, under the previous government—your government—have meant that regional communities have not been able to benefit from the scale of investment that would otherwise have occurred had there been certainty for investors about the energy transition underway. We know that because during the period of your government, those investors, those businesses, came before parliamentary committees over and over again and said to us that this was the case. They said to us that the consequence of having 22 different energy policies, none of which was ever landed, was that a whole series of investments didn't take place. That has direct costs, but it also has downstream costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During that same period, four gigawatts of capacity left the energy system, and only one gigawatt was invested to replace it. That makes a real difference to manufacturing operations; it makes a real difference to power prices; it makes a real difference to the capacity of the National Electricity Market to perform its functions, and all of those challenges are on your head.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Australians find themselves in a very difficult situation, and we are working methodically and carefully with industry to resolve it. Providing business certainty about our approach to climate and to energy is part of the repair job that is currently underway.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  Minister, I know it's part of your talking points to talk about a decade of delay in this policy area et cetera, et cetera, but you're in government now. We heard, through the Senate inquiry, the real impacts—positive and negative—that this change will have on rural and regional communities, on working-class people across this country. So for you to stand up and look backwards when you're about to bring down a budget—it was a very simple question: will you guarantee the projects and programs that were the first tranche of investment that our government put on the table while on a pathway to net zero by 2050? Things like $1.5 billion to diversify the Pilbara. Things like $2 billion for our Regional Accelerator Program for the regions, where communities that had the ambition to grow and diversify were going to be supported through developing and harnessing manufacturing capability and the like. Things like $750 million to diversify the Hunter. Things like over $2 billion for the Northern Territory. Actual money on the table for things to assist these communities and their working families to deal with what is legitimately coming. We've all got on the same page. Everybody had been talking a big game that there was not going to be anybody seriously impacted by this, but you were kidding yourselves. You are finally able to admit that, and I thank the union movement for assisting with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is, when you look at the EU on this question, they put hundreds of billions of euros on the table to help regions overcome the challenges and seize the opportunities. It is a pretty simple proposition. The money was budgeted for, over $20 billion specifically to this end, in the last budget. Will you guarantee that money will continue to flow? We care about these communities. We thought very long and hard about the types of projects and programs that would help them over the next four or five years with this transition.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  Minister, the Senate committee that inquired into this bill heard stark evidence of how the burning of wood from native forests for energy can in no way be considered renewable and in fact very clear evidence that burning native forest wood for energy actually emits more emissions than coal. So I'm pleased that in your speech last night you committed to the Senate committee recommendation to review the renewable energy status of wood from native forests. I note that Labor rejected classifying the burning of wood from native forests as renewable in both 2011 and 2015. I urge you and the government—and scientists and forest protectors are urging you—to make this change as a critical part of protecting our forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to go more broadly to the importance of protecting our forests and the link with acting on climate and to bring to your attention the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's assessment. They found in their Sixth Assessment Report earlier this year that the protection, improved management and restoration of forests and other ecosystems have the largest potential to reduce emissions and/or sequester carbon and that safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilience development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I've got two questions that I want to ask you, and I'm going to ask them both at once in the interests of time. Firstly on that latter point, in light of those findings from the IPCC, I want to know what work the government is doing or is intending to do on the bigger picture to assess protecting Australian forests for their value in carbon sequestration and storage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second one, then, is asking whether you could give us some more details, please, on the process that you outlined last night, where you said that you were going to 'release a consultation paper, consider next steps in light of the results of that consultation and look to make any necessary changes to the regulations by the end of the year'. But then you committed to 'exploring further amendments to primary and subordinate legislation to embed the targets and the Paris Agreement into a wider set of relevant legislations and schemes'. So I want to know the potential of embedding protection of forests and not considering wood from native forests as a renewable in further work down the track.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I want to return to the amendments before you, Chair. Senator David Pocock has suggested some amendments to provide for a review mechanism of certain particular impacts. An amendment that dealt with similar issues from Dr Haines went through the House, and it was very general. I note Senator Pocock has been a little bit more specific with his proposal. The Haines amendment was quite general. So I wanted to ask the government: to what extent would the Haines amendment, if you like, and the reviews now contained in this bill before us allow and provide for a benchmark of electricity prices over the next decade against what was promised in the Labor Party's Powering Australia plan?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before this place is one element of the Powering Australia plan that the Labor Party took to the election, and in that plan they made very specific promises about what Australians could expect from the implementation of their climate policies. In particular, I read from—I'm just finding the page number, but there are no page numbers! Sorry, it is page 4; it's just landscape. Thanks for clarifying that. On page 4 of the Powering Australia plan it says, 'It'—with 'it' being their Powering Australia policy—'will bring down household power bills by $275 in 2025'—just three Christmases away—'and $378 in 2030.' We've heard about the $275, but we don't hear as much about the $378. The Prime Minister mentioned the $275 20-odd times during the campaign.</span>

                    </a>  Ninety-seven times. Thank you, Senator Duniam. Nearly 100 times, the Prime Minister promised the Australian people before they voted that he would lower their power bills, by implementing these policies, by $275 a year. Their policy said it would be by $378 by 2030. We all know that since the election, since people have been hoodwinked into voting for this plan, the Labor Party hasn't mentioned the $275. It won't come from their mouths. Hopefully Senator McAllister will inform us about this $275 promise where the Prime Minister has refused to provide clarity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do now have this review mechanism. Because of the Haines amendment there is a review mechanism, and Senator Pocock is suggesting it go a little bit further and be more specific. So my question is: will the Haines amendment and/or the Pocock amendment allow for the benchmarking of the promise made to the Australian people? Will we see through these reviews what has happened to power prices and how it compares to what Labor promised their climate policy would achieve?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there already has been substantial criticism of the Labor Party's modelling of that figure. They released a related report on their Powering Australia policy, a modelling report by RepuTex, but by modelling report standards it was fairly skinny on detail. It didn't provide much detail on the assumptions that were made going into this report, nor did it include any related spreadsheets or tabulation of these figures. It would seem that the Labor Party has made a schoolboy error here, for want of a better term, on their calculations. Perhaps it explains why they are so shy about repeating a promise that they made very prominent in their campaign, and which presumably did influence a number of Australians about how they voted. I know that, at the election, living costs were a major issue for people, and the Labor Party were out there, saying: 'Hey, we're going to save you nearly 300 bucks. Vote for us!' But now they won't speak that number.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The modelling from the Labor Party showed, or purported to show—like all modelling, it's not gospel—that if you implemented the 43 per cent target and a range of other policy measures that Labor had promised, wholesale power prices would fall by 30 per cent. What the Labor Party seems to have done, from the skinny amount of detail we have, is that they've taken the 30 per cent drop in wholesale prices and said that retail prices will also drop by 30 per cent, giving you the $275 figure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, business is not the Labor Party's strength. We all know that. But even if you didn't know a lot about the electricity market, you'd probably know that the wholesale cost of something typically is only a proportion of the retail cost of something. In the old days, if you had a Campbells cash carry card, you could go down and buy a bunch of red frogs at a cheaper price because the wholesale price was cheaper than the price in the retail store. That's how the electricity market works. The wholesale costs of power, which are traded on a 30-minute interval every day, are paid for by the large retail companies, large customers who are buying a lot of power, who then on-sell that power to others. So the wholesale costs generally, to simplify matters, are the price of power as it leaves the power plant, as it leaves the solar farm. That's the cost up to that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course we don't hook our electrical appliances into a coal-fired power plant. We don't hook them straight into a solar farm. Power then has to be transported over large transmission lines. The voltage has to change, it has to go to distribution networks, and the retail companies themselves have costs and overheads associated with billing and customer management et cetera. The wholesale prices typically are only about a third of the total cost that you pay or a household pays in your electricity bill every quarter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Labor Party are only out by a factor of three. They have estimated that the wholesale power costs will come down by 30 per cent. Then they promised the Australian people: your power bills will come down by effectively 30 per cent—the $275 figure. But they forgot to do the calculations in between—it should actually be a 10 per cent reduction, roughly, in power prices, not a 30 per cent reduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've never really come to answer the question about these criticisms. As I said, these criticisms have been public and well known in the economic modelling community, which I used to sometimes be involved in. RepuTex, Labor's modellers, have been very scant in replying to these criticisms. But it is the modelling that the Labor Party stood behind and that they promised to the Australian people, so I think it is absolutely relevant for the minister here to tell the parliament and the Australian people: were there mistakes in the Australian Labor Party's modelling? Do they stand behind that modelling? Do they accept the criticisms that have been made about the mistake that seemingly was made between wholesale and retail power costs? Do they accept that? Do they stand behind everything that RepuTex says? We deserve to know that before we vote on this plan. It may have been a mistake to defraud the Australian people; it would be a catastrophic error to defraud the Australian parliament as well. That's what is before us here right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know the Australian people have been hoodwinked on this issue, but it's our job here in the Senate to scrutinise and evaluate the detail of the government's plan. Because of these unexplained errors that have been identified, I think it is very important, before we vote on this legislation and/or Senator Pocock's amendment about reviews, that the minister and the government come clean on their modelling and these issues that have been raised in a way they have refused to in the public domain. They have refused to answer these questions properly out in the public. But it is our job here—we should sit here as long as we need to. I'm on the clock for the Australian people. I'm happy to stay here as long as we need to, to get answers for the Australian people. As I said, this was not a little issue. This was not a non-core promise. This was a key part of the Labor Party's election platform, which they have walked away, ducked and weaved from being held to account for. Well, now is the time, before we vote for this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other senators, particularly new senators, like Senator Pocock: don't let the government get away with this. You have the power here to hold the government to account to provide a detailed and sufficient explanation to the Australian people about their election promises, about the work and analysis that was done to make those promises, before we vote on anything. As I said, we can stay here as long as we need to, to get these answers. Let's do that. Let's actually do our jobs as senators. Let's not be a rubber stamp; let's actually be a magnifying glass that gets to the fine print in the Powering Australia plan and identifies a number of deficiencies in this Powering Australia plan that the Labor Party released. We deserve to know the extent of those deficiencies before we vote on the plan here.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">NICK</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I'm pleased to continue this discussion. Senator Canavan made some very excellent points about modelling. But I'm not here to talk about modelling. I actually want to talk about measuring—about measuring data. Senator Canavan is an economist; I'm an accountant. The difference between economists and accountants is that we accountants actually have to count the real numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that in my first ever Senate inquiry—it was a Senate inquiry into the Great Barrier Reef—my first ever question, to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, was: 'Do you have a database of all the health KPIs relating to the reef that demonstrates a change or a trend from 1980?' That's when they first started recording data, or pretended to record data. The lady who was the head of the Australian Institute of Marine Science at the time spent the next seven minutes avoiding answering the question. All I wanted to know was: are these so-called scientists actually recording and measuring things like coral cover, things like coral growth rates, things like dissolved nitrogen, things like seagrass? And the answer is no. This is the problem. They make these extreme statements, like Senator Whish-Wilson did before, about how the Great Barrier Reef is dying. That's completely wrong, because the recent data has shown that coral cover is now at record highs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important to look into the detail of how this stuff is measured. Take coral bleaching, for example. They do these runs over the coral where they've got about a 50-metre boom on the back of each side of the boat, and that runs for about a kilometre. If they happen to find one little bit of bleaching on any coral, that entire area is then deemed to be bleached. That is so, so misleading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later that afternoon, the Queensland department of natural resources turned up. One of the great things I love about our federation is there's always a wrangle between the two levels of government. The Queensland department of natural resources is responsible for measuring run-off from the waterways on our big rivers, especially our big rivers in North Queensland. I asked them what the margin of error was and what their confidence interval was in terms of their measurements of dissolved nitrogen as it ran out of the river. Their response was—and I have to say I was quite shocked—between 60 and 90 per cent. In other words, their accuracy isn't even much better than a coin toss. This is something we see quite a lot of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we jump to our old good friends at the Bureau of Meteorology. I'm not sure if the people upstairs understand that we actually have three databases of temperature in this country. We have the raw data set, we have the ACORN-SAT 1 and we have the ACORN-SAT 2 dataset. Most people don't realise that when the media now report the change in temperature over the last hundred years they're actually reporting using the ACORN-SAT 2 dataset. The Bureau of Meteorology themselves admit that they fudge their numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you one example, which is Marble Bar. There've been 13 adjustments. Don't laugh, Senator McAllister; this is serious, and you need to take note of this, because this will be a question. There've been 13 adjustments to Marble Bar. Seven of them are statistical. In the little sub-footnote they say, 'We don't have to provide any documentary evidence for this.' So, out of the 13 amendments—and some of them are valid, like you move a weather station, so you may have to adjust for different things. I get that. Sometimes you have to homogenise data, or at least try to work out what it would have been had you not moved. One thing they didn't do I'll touch on in a minute. But of course, they won't do that. They just go: 'We don't have to provide data.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with that is they have a supercomputer that homogenises the data. The Bureau of Meteorology have admitted to me in estimates that this supercomputer has made 450 million iterations to the maximum temperature at Marble Bar and 250 million iterations to the minimum temperature at Marble Bar. What sort of a clown show are we running in this country when we're spending billions of dollars to try and control the temperature or limit the rise in temperature, and the way the actual temperature is being measured is being manipulated by a supercomputer that makes 450 million iterations? And when you actually want to then go and dive down into the detail, they say, 'We don't have to provide any documentary evidence.' If I did that as an accountant, if I went back and amended prior year records of a set of financial statements, I'd be thrown in jail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just have another shot at Senator Canavan here: economists can change their models all the time. That's the thing with models, you can change models all the time, but when it comes to real data, when you take that temperature measurement—</span>

                    </a>  That's true. With models you just fudge numbers, you change your assumptions, blah, blah, blah. But you don't get to do that. If I say I've got a million dollars in the bank or I've got shares in a company and it says you've got a million dollars in the bank, you'd better have a million dollars in the bank. You can't just go around fudging real data. I've asked the ABC about this in estimates, as well, because they report what the bureau calls homogenised data, what I call fudged numbers. If any other organisation did it they'd be thrown in jail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not saying the way the temperature was measured a hundred years ago was always accurate, either, but the way you report it is with a margin of error. You can't just go and change the number, because you don't know how much it's changed in the last hundred years, so you're guessing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, I want to talk about one other thing, this whole idea of job creation in the regions. Let me tell you that that is not the case. I happen to come from south-western Queensland, and the devastation to four great rural communities—Cunnamulla, Quilpie, Charleville and Thargomindah—because of the laws around mulga clearing has absolutely gutted that part of the world. The mulga blocks are being bought by foreign corporations, and they're being locked up for carbon storage. When the farmers sell out, they move out of the shires, so those regions are suffering because their populations are declining. You've now got unmanaged mulga, and, let me tell you, you have to manage your mulga. You have to constantly push it. It used to be a lot of Mitchell grass—it wasn't always all Mitchell grass—but you need to keep it relatively open. What we've now got means we're going to have an overrun of feral pigs and feral goats. Dingos are getting out there again, and that's not good. Then it will eventually be a fire hazard—heaven forbid. Luckily it's acacia and not eucalypts, but it can burn and, if it gets going, it will burn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to talk about my home town of Chinchilla and how you're going to create jobs. I note Senator David Pocock said, because he listens to ABARES, that farmers' incomes are off 20 per cent. Well, I tell you that's not due to climate change. That' due to all the red tape and green tape around climate change. I know one farmer who bought a property at Chinchilla recently, and he had to find out what he can do in cultivation. A little part of it was zoned a blue zone, so he went to confirm this with the department of natural resources. He also had to confirm it with another department in Queensland, the environment department. Guess what? They came back with a different definition of what the blue zone was. Then this farmer had to employ a consultant to go back to the bureaucrats to get them to work together to define what the blue zone was, because of these stupid arbitrary laws that the government makes up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This sort of constant red tape and green tape out there is absolutely killing our farmers. These guys are the backbone of the country. I note that we've got 40 different models to determine net zero and all these arbitrary crazy models on different regulations—they discount coal, for example, at 14 per cent but they discount renewables at seven per cent; that's a great way to fudge a set of numbers. That's what we see. My question is: what dataset will the Labor Party be using? Will they use the dataset that's recorded at the time the temperature is measured, or will the Bureau of Meteorology continue to go back and change prior years' data in order to push their narrative and the Labor Party's narrative? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and E</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">nergy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  There are a number of questions asked by senators, and I thought it best perhaps to let people get their questions out before taking up any more of the Senate's time. I'll start with the questions that Senator Rice asked me. Her primary interest was in understanding more about the government's response to the recommendation made by the Senate committee when they were reviewing the bill, and in particular the recommendation that goes to the eligibility requirements for native forest wood waste in the Renewable Energy Target. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We accept this recommendation, and I made a few remarks about this last night, but I will put it on the record again. The concerns raised—and I understand the committee heard a good deal about this—relate to a decision by the Abbott government in 2015 to change regulations and put native forest wood waste back into the scheme. That was a decision that we opposed at the time. As the minister said in the House of Representatives, and recently in the media, we are happy to consider the concerns raised. The government will consult on changes to the relevant regulations. The issue raised is a technical issue with eligibility requirements under the Renewable Energy Target. Our response to that recommendation shouldn't be understood as a reflection on the government's general support for sustainable native forest industries and the workers who depend on those industries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the industry is generally looking for higher-value uses for native forest products and electricity generation, and we note the evidence from the Clean Energy Regulator to the Senate inquiry that the use of this particular fuel source is not economic, with only one small project currently registered. Nonetheless, we do agree that consultation on this issue is important, we want to make sure that any changes are understood by stakeholders, and we want to make sure that issues for the existing project could be considered. We would aim for any necessary changes to the regulations as a consequence of that consultative process to be made before the end of the year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rice also, I think, noted the recommendation from the committee report which asked the government to undertake further consultation on possible legislative amendments and appropriate policy responses. The government has already committed to this. We intend to look at additional amendments to legislation or subordinate instruments over the next year to further embed the targets and the Paris Agreement into relevant schemes. We're happy to do so, and we look forward to consulting with interested stakeholders during this process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I note Senator Rice's advocacy for the significance of native forests as an opportunity for sequestration. The government is of course interested in opportunities to maximise sequestration. The land use sector is a core part of our response to climate change. It offers very significant opportunities, and I note that there are many in the agriculture sector who are looking to take advantage of those opportunities under schemes that have been in place for quite some time now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions from the opposition are a little different in character, because, again, we have had contributions that essentially dispute the value of pursuing a net zero objective, despite the fact that this appears to be an opposition policy, but that is of no concern to Senator Canavan. And then there was a series of objections from Senator Rennick, which are a little harder to get one's head around, shall we say, in this environment. The curious thing is that on these questions the coalition seem to be increasingly isolated from the stakeholders that they claim to represent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the National Farmers' Federation say to the Senate inquiry about the matter before us? The National Farmers' Federation said that they recognise that this is framework legislation that embeds a national 2030 and 2050 target in legislation and makes consequential amendments to related acts and this provides a level of business certainty that is otherwise absent. </span>

They talked a lot, actually, about how industry was ahead of the government that you all participated in. They said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the Farmers Federation talking about the industries in their sector, all of which are on a journey to net zero. But we have the National Party questioning whether making that transition is something that should be happening. It's already happening. It's already happening in the industries that you claim to represent, and it speaks to the isolation and the strange position that you have all got yourself into. So determined were the coalition through your last decade in utilising this issue in a base way for narrow political purposes that you actually lost track of the people that you're supposed to represent. It was all on show. It's all been on show in the Senate inquiry and in the discussion around this bill and this process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan put a series of questions about power prices and his views. Of course, the entire country is still coping with the mess left by Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor as energy minister presided over an utterly chaotic energy policy that left investors and businesses totally confused about their obligations. I can't tell you how many private conversations, how many people, have offered up the insight that they are relieved to be in a position where they can actually talk about the climate transition, the challenge facing their business and the way that business and government will partner to meet that great challenge.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm reluctant really to contemplate in any serious way the contributions from a group of people who appear unclear about who they represent and who appear to be unwilling to concede the mess that they left for the sector. However, I will go to the specific issues that were raised by Senator Canavan. He speaks, of course, about our proposals for the power sector. The modelling suggests that, if we pursue 43 per cent and we implement the arrangements around transmission, we will see a significant increase in the penetration of renewables. The facts are that that will put downward pressure on power prices, because any assessment that examines the levelised cost of energy will show that firmed renewables offer the cheapest possibility to put new-generation capacity into the system, cheaper than any of the proposals pursued by you and certainly cheaper than the propositions that you never implemented for new generation—billions of dollars promised for new generation; none of it ever actually delivered under the programs championed by the National Party—downward pressure on prices as a consequence of the program that we are implementing. I know they don't want to hear it, because the mess that they left behind is embarrassing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  Thank you, Madam Chair. I hope so. Minister, there was a lot of rhetoric around that last answer, particularly invoking the entire nation of farmers and primary producers as somehow only supporting the Labor Party. We in the National Party and rural and regional Liberal members have been very, very public about supporting industries' goals for zero emissions. The cattle industry made a decision, without a government mandate, to move towards a net-zero position for the beef industry by 2030—knock themselves out. What we're discussing here in this chamber today is the government legislating it. For you to stand up and make out that we don't accept that the Australian people voted for you to have the right to change our nationally determined contributions to 43 per cent by 2030, on a pathway to net zero by 2050—they did. You have that right. You changed the document. What we're discussing here is not climate change action or no climate change action. What we're actually talking about is legislating a target and what implications that has for our communities and our people—above symbolism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the questions that the farming community raise—they are very concerned, particularly the cattle industry and the livestock industry more generally—is: by legislating this target, are we going to see the Albanese government sign up to the Global Methane Pledge? That is a significant issue. You make out like they're all singing kumbaya with the Labor Party. They're not. They are great stewards of their land. They tread lightly. They were conservationists before you all thought it was a thing, because they are intergenerationally linked with their environment and they care for it. They take is seriously. But they did not sign up to the UN methane pledge. I am very interested in whether this government is going to make our nation head down that path. I want you to rule that out. On behalf of Australia's livestock industry, I want you to guarantee that you won't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also the shadow minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development. One of my roles is to look after Infrastructure Australia, one of the14 agencies that legislating a target will actually be captured into. They will now have to assess infrastructure projects in this country according to this target. I had severe concerns when I was legitimately asking these questions—so I could understand it—of the agencies before the Senate inquiry: 'What's going to be the impact of legislating this target? Is it going to be negative? Is it going to be positive? What is it going to mean for the list that you give to the infrastructure minister? Does it mean that rail, road and bridge projects in rural and regional Australia are going to fall down the list because public transport projects in Sydney and Melbourne are going to suddenly go up the list because of this target being legislated?' I have severe concerns about that. You know what? They couldn't answer the question. They had no idea how they were going to do it. They couldn't actually tell the Senate what the impact of this legislation would be on their decisions and, therefore, on the infrastructure projects that are going to be delivered across our nation—$120 billion worth of spend. They didn't have a clue. Minister, I hope you've got a clue. I hope you can enlighten me on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third issue and question I have is around the concerns about increased vexatious green lawfare as a result of legislating, not as a result of your right to go and change our nationally determined contribution. Forty-three per cent by 2030—knock yourselves out with a suite of policies to get there. We will hold you to account on the way. What we've seen in Germany and the UK is that there has then been a slew of organisations—similar to the Environmental Defenders Office and Friends of the Earth—taking national governments to court about much-needed projects such as the third runway at Heathrow. They're holding that project up. It's defeated. It can go. It can stop. It can start. It can stop. I note the finance minister is in the chamber and she is very concerned about how we actually maintain our productivity as a nation going forward if we aren't going to be investing in these types of infrastructure projects, which is how we're actually going to drive our productivity across our economy. Yet today we are looking at legislating a target which is going to increase lawfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate inquiry we asked every single one of those NGOs: 'In legislating this target will you guarantee you won't be taking the Albanese government to court? Do you guarantee you won't be taking any future federal government to court as a result of legislating the target?' Do you know what, Senator Duniam and Senator Canavan? No, they wouldn't rule it out. They can't wait to take you to court on every single infrastructure project that will come under this bill. Recognising that you have a mandate for a 43 per cent target is not the same as baking it into the way we run this joint and planning projects for the future so that they are not held up in court, so they are not blowing out the time lines for critical nation-building infrastructure—Inland Rail and airport runways in Melbourne, which will be critical to driving our critical infrastructure going forward—and we should all be bipartisan about that. They refused to rule it out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I have three questions. On the methane pledge, what is the methodology of the 14 agencies whose assessment you are going to make subjected to this legislated requirement? How are they going to do it? What impacts will that have for rural and regional Australians and for infrastructure in our communities? What are you going to do when the Friends of the Earth come for you, just like they have in other jurisdictions that have chosen this path, that have chosen to seek grandstanding symbolism over actual action on climate change? You don't need a legislated target; you can just get on with the job. Stop talking about it; get on with the job. As this will probably be my final contribution to this debate—</span>

I would really encourage the government, as they head into their ERC process for budget, to be serious about supporting the regions, keeping the programs and projects that we handed down in the March budget—the additional $20 billion—that were specifically to support these communities on their journey to net zero, to not only seize the opportunities but importantly overcome the challenges that are coming their way. You are naive if you think that's not happening. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I have three quick answers. I'm very conscious that Senator Pocock is seeking the call and Senator Roberts was seeking the call at some earlier point. On methane, we have spoken about this publicly, but I will reiterate it. The government is in the process of careful consultation with Australian farmers and the resources sector regarding the global methane pledge. We are working with key industry stakeholders and peak bodies, and that process is led by my colleagues Minister Watt and Minister King.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is fundamentally committed to working in a collaborative and genuinely consultative way. I reiterate again that there has been an enormous sense of relief in many of the stakeholders that I have spoken to that that is the case with this government because it wasn't their experience with the last.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Infrastructure Australia, the consequential amendments bill amends the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to allow Infrastructure Australia to take account of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets when conducting audits of nationally significant infrastructure, developing plans and providing advice. This does not preclude other relevant issues being considered, including in relation to climate risk and adaptation. It is merely an additional feature of the things that that body may consider when they are undertaking their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Senator McKenzie asked about lawfare. This was the subject of some discussion in the inquiry process. There were a number of quite interesting submissions. The Wilderness Society gave evidence that the nature of the bills do not give rise to actions that can be taken against the government. The Australian Forest Products Association explained that lawfare is already prevalent in forestry operations; therefore, they do not expect that this legislation will have any additional material effect. BP said: 'Our hope is that by legislating the target and by providing a transparent and accountable framework for its delivery, the legislation might even reduce the uncertainty that can sometimes be a driver for litigation.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The clear message coming through from business in that process and more broadly is that certainty helps. Comparisons between this bill and legislation in other countries don't assist us in this case because the legislation before us is quite different to the form of the legislation that is in place in other countries. The evidence that was provided to the committee was that this was an unlikely outcome of the legislation that the committee was examining. I hope that that provides assistance to Senator McKenzie.</span>

But I would like to point out to the Senate that this is already happening. We've seen young people take the former government to court, saying that they have a duty of care to future generations. We are seeing at the moment Tiwi Islanders and Gamilaraay people taking Santos to court over fossil fuel projects. Lawfare is happening. Litigation is happening.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my sense that that happens when the government's not actually doing what the Australian people want and not actually making decisions that are in the best interests of all of us. It seems to me that this bill before us is a way to begin to do that, to turn another page in terms of climate change, and to say that we're actually going to get serious about this and we're going to deal with the challenge at hand. The battle should be about how we act, rather than if we should act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that in mind, I would urge the Senate to bring a vote on the amendments that I have put forward. I note that there are other amendments that we are yet to get to, and I'm sure that will provide Senator Canavan with opportunity to ask more questions of the minister and others. In the interests of time, if it's okay with you, Chair, I thought I might speak to the amendment that I hope to move in the next section.</span>

                    </a>  I'm talking about the amendments on sheet 1619. The first amendment requires that the annual climate change statement address Australia's progress in reducing scope 3 emissions, which we know dwarf our domestic emissions. Fossil fuel exports account for more than double our direct emissions. If we are to take climate change seriously and commit to climate action we have to reduce the source of the majority of our emissions, which is exports. I'm not saying we shut it down overnight; I'm simply saying we don't open up new projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment requires that the Climate Change Authority consider the best available scientific knowledge in advice on emission reduction targets. We have ignored scientists for far too long. Science has to guide our policies on climate, and it makes sense to me that any advice given to the minister would be based on the best available scientific evidence that we have, given the wealth of knowledge in the scientific community, including a number of pre-eminent climate scientists across Australia and in the ACT.</span>

I think Senator Canavan asked some very important questions, not dissimilar to the questions I asked, around what modelling has been undertaken on the impact that a 75 per cent reduction in emissions would have on power prices. I did not get an answer to this question, because apparently it's not worth answering, and we don't need to be accountable on those sorts of suggestions.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                    </a>  Not from you, Senator McAllister, but from the leader of the Australian Greens. I don't think it is right that an answer was not given to Senator Canavan around the $275 promise made by the Australian government nearly 100 times in the lead-up to the election. In the answer you gave, you made no reference to that promise at all; you just talked about downward pressure. I don't think it is unfair for us to ask—on behalf of the Australian people, some of whom are in the gallery today—whether that promise is going to be delivered. Is the $275 figure, which was specified nearly 100 times in the lead-up to 21 May, going to be delivered as a result of all of this? I think a direct answer on that would be good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can go to the matter of lawfare and the issues Senator McKenzie raised that have also been touched on by Senator Pocock—you have provided some response to that, as well. I note in your answer you gave to Senator McKenzie you talked about how the legislation here takes on a different form to that of legislation passed in other countries; I presume the United Kingdom, Germany and France. I am interested that, regardless of the form of legislation, the end result is a target enshrined in legislation, which is what we will have here. At the end of the passage of this bill, 43 per cent will exist in legislation. What analysis or advice was considered in the development of the government's view on this issue that it will not pave the way to greater lawfare? We heard only earlier this week—it might have been Monday—the Greens environment spokesperson say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The climate wars will not end this week with the passage of Labor's climate bill …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was a direct quote from Senator Hanson-Young. They're upfront, they're open and they're honest about it, and that is the position they are going to take. This bill will pass, but there's a guarantee that, should new coal and gas projects be opened up, the wars are still on. What advice or analysis, based on the legislation that has been drafted, was considered—are you able to take us through that?—in order to back the guarantee you put in place before, given the legislation here in Australia we are currently debating in this Senate is in a different form to that of legislation passed through other jurisdictions and put in place? If you can't provide that guarantee, I think it will just end up as a matter before the courts and we will see perhaps a torrent of legal action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wilderness Society, along with other organisations who are defenders of the environment, as they say, suggest there's not going to be an issue: 'Don't worry; this will not pave the way to greater lawfare.' The point has been made that these things already happen. AFPA, the Australian Forest Products Association, a great organisation, weren't waving away concerns that this might pave the way to greater lawfare. The fact that it already happens is not a good reason to give those who seek to cause these issues a bigger platform to stand on. To that end I think we need to take seriously these concerns and provide a guarantee, so we have some sort of intent expressed on behalf of the government, around what it is that this law should and should not enable to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of overseas examples I turn to the United Kingdom and specifically the case of the Transport Action Network, who took action against the UK Secretary of State for Transport and the Highways England company. In referring to this case, in the statements of facts and the grounds for the case the Transport Action Network stated that the UK Secretary of State for Transport failed to take account of the impact of the UK government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Road Investment Strategy 2</span> on achieving specific climate change objectives, in particular the carbon budgets that were set by the government pursuant to section 4 of the Climate Change Act 2008 and the targets set by section 1 of the Climate Change Act for the net UK carbon account to be zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At least the second of those elements sounds pretty similar where we're going to end up, bar the detail of the specific number, after the passage of this legislation. According to the Transport Action Network in their case, new road infrastructure projects result in the loss of vegetation and of soils. There's embodied carbon in concrete, asphalt and raw materials which lead to higher vehicle speeds over time. It also allows for more traffic. So, given that sort of case that has been presented in the United Kingdom, on the basis of the facts I've just read out to you, what guarantee can you give us? Again, you made a statement earlier suggesting that, because the legislation here takes a different form, we won't have the same issues they have had in the United Kingdom, putting to one side the cases we've seen in France and Germany, where we have the judiciary directing the legislature and the executive on how to deal with carbon emissions and laws around that place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'd be keen to understand that, on behalf of those people we are enacting these laws on behalf of. Again: power prices, the $275—a direct answer on that—and 'lawfare'. What guarantees exist from the government around what is going to happen once these laws are passed?</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally: sadly, this is what happens when we guillotine debate. The coalition would happily sit here tonight until this debate is exhausted. Instead, we are dealing with one of their signature pieces of legislation in a couple of hours; all these amendments, on which many of the crossbenchers aren't going to be able to speak because of the fact that time is running out. This is what happens in this brave new world of Labor-Greens politics: we've guillotined the debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I will proceed. I am just conscious that Senator Roberts has sought the call a couple of times. It may be that he seeks to remind me that he asked me a question about net zero, and I thought one of the things I could do in this contribution would be to respond to that question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But first I will step through the amendments that Senator Pocock foreshadowed in his earlier contribution and indicate that the government will not be supporting these amendments. Amendment (1) on sheet 1619 is the amendment that goes to scope 3 emissions. We do not support this amendment because our plan is focused on the framework set out by the Paris Agreement, and that agreement sets out obligations to reduce Australia's emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment on sheet 1619 asks the Climate Change Authority to explain how it has taken into account best available scientific knowledge in preparing advice. We essentially do not support this change because we consider it redundant. I should clarify, though, that—unlike the previous government—we are in no way afraid of science, or scientists or independent advice. We've already amended the bill in the other places to reference the best available science. It's in the objects clause. The objects clause also makes explicit reference to article 2 of the Paris Agreement. That includes the global temperature goals, which are science based. For that reason we do not support further amendments to duplicate the existing provisions of this bill. However, as I indicated earlier, we support some of the other amendments moved by Senator Pocock that are before the chair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think they're both of the matters that are dealt with on sheet 1619. Senator Duniam asked that I step through the legal advice. I think Senator Duniam will appreciate that it is not common practice for governments to make explicit or public the legal advice that they rely upon. But I can perhaps provide some information. The purpose of the legislation is to create a framework for private sector investment and to provide policy certainty. We have canvassed this already, and that is what business tell us that they need. The bill's development was informed by legal advice, including regarding potential litigation risks. Neither bill limits, constrains or directs how the government's policies are set or how the government would consider approving new resource or infrastructure projects, and the bills impose no legal obligation on any minister to make decisions on such projects in a certain way. It's on that basis that the department's advice was that there is no reason to expect that this bill will result in increased successful litigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jurisdictions like Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Mexico, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and Victoria, where similar legislation—but not the same legislation—already exists have not seen an increase in successful litigation against the government. But they have seen increased investment and reduced emissions. That is part of the reason the government supports the bill as international best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Senator Roberts asked about what net zero emissions means. Perhaps the best thing to do, Senator Roberts, is refer you to article 4 of the Paris Agreement, which talks about that. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases …</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  Balance between sources and sinks—wonderful!—and no impact of costs on the economy. So let's have a look at another aspect of this. You're not aware of net zero—it took you a long while to come up with that—and the best you can do is go to the United Nations, a fraudulent organisation, and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Senator Wong couldn't do it yesterday, so let's consider another agency that you rely on, the CSIRO. From September 2016 to March 2022 I've cross-examined the CSIRO and the previous Chief Scientist on climate science. CSIRO's climate science team made three presentations to me and my Senate office team, each about 2½ hours in length, and the first one was attended by the Chief Executive, Dr Larry Marshall. During the CSIRO's presentations, Minister, they made these facts, they stated these statements or they failed to confirm. Are you aware of these? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, I must say that the CSIRO has been the primary reference for the Greens, the Labor Party, the National Party and the Liberal Party in government for their positions on climate change. The CSIRO admitted in its first presentation to me, under my cross-examination and my team's cross-examination, that it has never stated that carbon dioxide from human activity poses a danger. So we asked them, 'Where did the politicians come up with the pronouncement that you have stated that?' They said, 'Well, you'd better check with the politicians.' This is a political issue. Statements of danger came from politicians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point: the CSIRO never quantified, in any of their three presentations or in Senate estimates since, any specific impact of carbon dioxide from human activity on any climate or weather variable such as temperature, rainfall, droughts, storms, ocean alkalinity, ocean salinity—nothing. Yet this is the fundamental basis that the National Party, the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the Greens and Senator Pocock rely upon as a basis for climate and energy policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the CSIRO admitted—admitted—today's temperatures are not unprecedented. Today's temperatures are not unprecedented—CSIRO admission. CSIRO has failed to provide any logical scientific point showing that carbon dioxide from human activity causes climate change and needs to be cut. CSIRO relied instead upon unvalidated, erroneous and discredited computer models, which is what you're relying on now to squeeze the Australian people. The CSIRO has failed to provide any statistically significant evidence of any change in any climate or weather factor. They've never provided the empirical data or the logical scientific points on that. CSIRO initially relied upon one discredited paper on temperatures, Marcott 2013—one paper, after 48 years of so-called climate science. We demolished that—in fact, it had been demolished when it was first released. CSIRO has failed to actually counter what we've said about Marcott. They ran away from that discussion and stopped talking about it. Then they presented Harries 2001, a sole paper on carbon dioxide. They could not refute our criticism of those papers. Then they presented Lecavalier on temperatures. They have failed to produce any response to that—any response at all. That Lecavalier paper on temperature was in 2017. And, on carbon dioxide, they came out with Feldman 2015. Again, that was shown to be completely irrelevant, and the CSIRO has failed to come back to us again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are fundamental things. The CSIRO admitted that it has not done due diligence on data that it's brought in and relied upon from external agencies. CSIRO admits to not doing due diligence on reports from external agencies or on supposedly scientific papers it has provided. This is what this bill is based on. CSIRO revealed little understanding of papers it cited as evidence. CSIRO allows politicians and journalists to misrepresent CSIRO without correction, and the CSIRO has misled parliament. Minister, are you aware of these fundamental facts?</span>

I again refer to my previous answer and make the point that no announcement was made. As I said to him yesterday, I answered a question about Australian electoral assistance in the Solomons, which has been ongoing for 20 years. I am surprised that the opposition continue, knowing as they do, having been so recently in government—and Senator Payne, I'm sure, can advise Senator Birmingham about the challenge of a greater contest in our region—to want to press this. I was very clear—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hope that there would be bipartisanship around what is occurring in our region. The government has been very clear about the importance of both the Pacific and South-East Asia. The Prime Minister, Minister Conroy, I and others have been in the region. We have increased the assistance through the development assistance program. We have shifted on climate, which is the first national security priority of Pacific island nations. And what I would say to the shadow minister for foreign affairs is that it might be best to leave behind some of the mistakes that were undertaken in government and perhaps work in a bipartisan way to strengthen Australia's security position in the Pacific.</span>

And I have to say I find it passing strange that I'd get a question about engagement from a government that had so little engagement, both before and after a security agreement with China was entered into, and whose best response was to send Minister Seselja.</span>

Unlike for many years, we actually have visited—I think the last Australian foreign minister to visit was Ms Bishop—and I had very good private discussions as well as public engagement with the President and with my counterpart, the Minister for Finance. The issue that concerns Timor-Leste, correctly, is the economic and fiscal difficulties they see into the future as the Bayu-Undan field and the Petroleum Fund diminish and the fact that the Greater Sunrise project has been stalled for years. Unlike your government, we will work with them to try to resolve that issue.</span>

For many people in this chamber—regrettably, not those opposite—this day is a day that has been a long time coming, a day on which historic legislation has been passed in response to one of the most urgent and pressing issues of our time: climate change. It is no accident that the bill that the Senate has just voted on was one of the first pieces of legislation introduced by the Albanese government, because we know that Australians deserve and our nation needs overdue leadership in this area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the passage of the legislation in this place, can I first acknowledge those who worked with the government constructively on sensible amendments, and can I also acknowledge the support from the business community.

                <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation brings Australia a step closer to ending the so-called climate wars, which have been counterproductive and served as a handbrake on progress towards decarbonisation and have slowed our economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Farmers Federation said in evidence to the Senate inquiry that the bills are 'framework legislation that can provide business certainty'. I know it's hard for the National Party to realise that their base is not with them on this. I know that's hard, but they are not. The Investor Group on Climate Change talked about the opportunity to 'unlock hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of investment in climate solutions'. It is those opposite who are out of touch.</span>

The rest of the world does watch closely what Australia does on climate. As well as lifting our international competitiveness, the passage of this legislation is a watershed moment in Australia's international standing. Countries of our region in particular look to Australia as a member of the Pacific family to act with respect for their existential interest in action on climate change. If the shadow foreign minister actually wanted to ensure we had stronger relations with the Pacific, he would not have voted against action on climate change, which is precisely one of the disadvantages to our national interests that the former government continue to hold on to. It is simply not good enough for senators to say, 'Well, this country isn't doing enough,' or, 'That country isn't doing enough.' Our Pacific family expects more from us.</span>

Whether it's former senator Barnaby Joyce or former senator Abetz in the past or Senator Canavan, Senator Rennick and so many others today, too many senators have been part of the problem, not part of the solution. Unfortunately, some senators still persist. We see Senator Rennick now. We see people who refuse to listen to the Australian people. They refuse to acknowledge the message at the federal election three months ago. So far, it has been more of the same for them. They opposed the climate bills before they saw them. What is most extraordinary is they just ignore the message of the Australian people. They just ignore the message of the Australian people. You're not content with losing touch with Australians in Boothby, Curtin, Goldstein et cetera. You're just out of touch— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I did remind senators yesterday, and I'll remind senators again today, that when you call a point of order you simply state the point of order and then not get into argument or other statements. I do believe that the minister is being relevant. He has just started answering the question. There were a lot of interjections the minute he stood so it's quite difficult to hear him, but I am listening carefully. </span>

What I do remember is the now opposition copying the policy of Labor, then opposition, when it came to child care, but not delivering that policy in full, and for that reason, that policy—what was then your policy—left a lot of Australian families much more out of pocket than ours will.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the other point to be noticed here is that, as we have consistently said, child care is not simply a social welfare program. Child care is not simply about economically supporting families who receive childcare benefits, as important as that is. Increasing childcare payments is an important economic policy of this government to broaden, in particular, women's participation in the workforce. Having affordable child care, regardless of income, is an important measure for this government to take to increase women's participation in the workforce. It is a shame that the former government didn't take the opportunity in any of the nine and a bit years that it was in government to do the same thing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, yesterday's national accounts showed that profits share of national income hit a new record high and that wages share of national income hit a new record low. This means that, in the 60 years that the national accounts have been kept and published, never have business owners been getting a bigger slice of the pie and never have workers been getting a smaller slice of the pie. Will your government now finally accept that in the domestic context it is corporate profiteering that is a key driver of inflation and that wages are actually not driving inflation?</span>

That's why we have done absolutely everything we can since coming to government to make sure that we are supporting sensible and reasonable wage increases, particularly in areas like the minimum wage for working people on the lowest wages in the country and also in the area of aged care, where we're supporting the Fair Work Commission. </span>

I remember the governor making comments about wanting to see wage increases with a 3 in front of them. My recollection is he said that at a time when inflation was sitting below three per cent, probably in the order of 1.7 per cent. My recollection of that is that the governor was saying that wages were a handbrake on the economy, or slow wages growth was a handbrake on the economy, and he wanted to see them get moving. We are now, of course, in a different environment, and I've only had a short opportunity to look at Governor Lowe's remarks in his speech today. But I think that in his speech he went through that and explained. I think he used the word 'surprised' around the increase in the rate of inflation, and he certainly went through the unexpected nature of that inflation surge and some of the reasons behind that in detail. I think his record on wages has been— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

I think the review that's underway is useful, and Governor Lowe has made comments on that today. I think the Reserve Bank is doing the work that it needs to do to bring inflation down, but the review will certainly assist all of us to ensure that the Reserve Bank remains fit for purpose. And I think the governor has been accountable for the comments he's made and some of the decisions the bank has made, particularly in the last few months, in raising interest rates. I understand he's given his speech today, he's given a long press conference afterwards, so, in that respect, he has been accountable for those decisions.</span>

As senators may be aware, across the government—whether it's the Prime Minister, myself or other ministers both within cabinet and within the portfolio—we are obviously actively engaging in the region. What we hear from other nations in the region, from friends and partners, is the value of genuine engagement, of respect and of listening. Most importantly, we want to engage in a region that recognises that our futures are shared. These are challenging times in the world. We all understand that. But it's best that we navigate these challenges together—stronger together—with our friends and our partners in the region. The region does value partnership, and that is the approach that this government will continue to take.</span>

APRA's review of super fund marketing expenditure found that 12 funds spent $87 million on marketing between 2018 and 2020. Funds have a legal duty to spend members' money in a way that financially benefits the members. The regulator found funds had a lack of evidence that this spending can be justified. But, instead of cleaning up this apparent waste of money, your government is cutting back on transparency over how this spending gets disclosed. Why are you making it easier for funds to spend the retirement savings of everyday Australians on billboards and TV ads promoting themselves when the regulator clearly says this money isn't delivering benefits to members?</span>

Labor is committed to delivering accountability, transparency and good governance in every part of our financial system. Our world-class superannuation system is a massive success story, delivering $3.4 trillion in national savings and better retirement outcomes for Australians. I think Senator Lambie is referring to the regulations that will come before this Senate around some changes that were being made to streamline disclosure requirements for superannuation funds and aligning those with the national accounting standards. The new regulations will still require superannuation funds to disclose, in particular in relation to any political donations, and they will ensure that the new regulations will have a high level of meaningful transparency for superannuation members.</span>

So here's my question: how much extra would it cost, exactly, for funds to tell people what numbers they added up to get to their final figure?</span>

But I do understand that there is a view that aligning some of the requirements or reducing red tape around them, but still allowing requisite information that members will be after, is behind the regulations that the minister has made. I should say that the regulations still do require a level of information to be provided through these annual members' meetings. I see, and the government sees, no reason for any reduced transparency for members. This allows streamlined reporting in line with some of the other arrangements, including the Australian Accounting Standards.</span>

This is because, unlike those opposite, we recognise the potential and, frankly, at times the inherent conflict of interest in ministers in a cabinet making decisions whilst owning shares. So we have set a higher standard, and I appreciate that the opposition want to probe the merits of that. We do think it's appropriate.

I would say to him that it is not a highly contested position by most who look at the energy market in Australia that the cheapest new form of generation is clean energy. In fact, there is a live market experiment for that, and that is the state of the electricity market today. We had four gigawatts exiting, one coming in, during the life of the previous government. Those are the figures that I recall. Senator McAllister will tell me if I'm wrong. They reflect the lack of certainty in the market, as a consequence of the failure of those opposite to deal with their internal divisions, as is the case today.</span>

That is an unremarkable proposition—a proposition that is shared by those who manage our electricity system as well as the business community. I respect that Senator Canavan is very clear in his interjections about his views on this issue. They're not shared, as I understand it, by the remainder of the coalition.

I'm not sure where you got to at the end of the question. But I think I understand the argument of the question, and if I don't then I'm sure the senator can follow it up with a supplementary question. But the proposition that we can simply stay with the old coal-fired power electricity generation and that that's going to give us cheaper energy is just no longer the case. And do you know how we know that? It is because no private sector entity wanted to invest in the new coal-fired power.</span>

That is why we went to the last election with a position to strengthen the Modern Slavery Act and regulation within our economy, because whether it's from Xinjiang, as the senator has referenced, or elsewhere in the world, you know from the work that Walk Free and others have done that forced labour, which we regard in our heads as something of the past, is something of the present. We should do what those opposite failed to do in government—in fact, they voted against provisions to strengthen the Modern Slavery Act here in Australia. We should be clear about ensuring that we require companies to be far more careful in assuring their supply chains and that we do not allow our purchases unknowingly to condone forced labour anywhere in the world.</span>

In recent years we've seen the increasing impacts of climate change on our communities and our environment, from the most savage bushfires our country has ever seen to some of the most devastating floods on record. As our climate changes and natural disasters become more common, the way in which we manage our emergency response needs to change as well. Unlike those opposite, we are committed to acting on climate change, both through reducing our emissions and by supporting those communities most impacted by the effects of climate change. The bill we have just passed today is an important part of reducing those emissions, and better preparing for future disasters also protects communities as well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country and a government, we need to be better prepared and we need to respond more quickly to natural disasters. Unfortunately, when those opposite were in power they did neither, and that left Australians exposed. If we are asking Australians to be better prepared for natural disasters, then our government needs to do the same thing. That's why, last week, I formally launched the National Emergency Management Agency, or NEMA, bringing together the capabilities of Emergency Management Australia and the National Recovery and Resilience Agency into a single agency. NEMA will bring together the capabilities of both agencies to provide support, prepare for future disasters, lead the response when disaster strikes and remain deeply connected with communities during recovery. It simply made no sense to have two separate disaster agencies in two different departments reporting to two different ministers, which was the situation we had under the former government. Bringing these agencies together as one, NEMA, will provide better coordination at a national level and ensure that we are better prepared for natural disasters and that we respond more quickly.</span>

Yesterday in the House of Representatives the Albanese government introduced amendments to the Disaster Ready Fund legislation. These amendments will ensure that $200 million a year allocated in the fund is spent on disaster mitigation while maintaining our commitment to support communities as they recover from disasters. I think members on both sides of this chamber will remember the comments that I had to make about the former government's Emergency Response Fund, set up over three years ago with the support of the then opposition with $4 billion in it. It was set up to spend money every year on disaster mitigation and disaster recovery. By the time we got to the election, after three years it hadn't built a single disaster mitigation project and hadn't released a single cent for disaster recovery. We're determined to change that, and I'm happy to report that this legislation has been welcomed by stakeholders across the community, from the Insurance Council of Australia and Suncorp to the RACQ and the Local Government Association of Queensland.</span>

I've recently been briefed by the Bureau of Meteorology about what they are forecasting for the upcoming high-risk weather season, and members of parliament and senators were invited to a similar briefing this week as well. It's true that, while there is a very high chance of a third La Nina this summer bringing more rain and flooding to the east coast states—and we need to be ready for that—in addition, in Central and Western Australia communities are facing increased chances of bushfire.</span>

That may well include the redeployment of some aerial firefighting units to the west. Also last week the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System was launched. This is a once-in-a-generation change to how the sector forecasts and warns about fire danger. Unlike our predecessors, the Albanese government is looking over the horizon and ensuring we're better prepared.</span>

There was provision made for some of this by the previous government when you lot were in power. There was some money put aside in the budget. We expect that there will be some additional investments—we see them as investments, rather than costs—that go to making sure that we do this properly, that we bring people together, that we unite the nation and that we do it properly. That is why so much work is going into the engagement mechanisms and making sure that the working group is able to have all of the conversations they need to have to bring people together, to make sure that we do this in a way that unites the country rather than divides it. If there are additional costs, they will be in the budget.</span>

I'm advised that a family with one child earning $60,000 a year currently faces out-of-pocket costs of $2,430 a year. Under Labor's cheaper childcare plan they will pay only $1,620 out of pocket per year. A family earning $400,000 a year with one child faces current out-of-pocket costs of $16,000, and under the Albanese government's plan they will pay about $12,000. Under the government's plan, 96 per cent of Australian families with children in child care will be better off. This is a cost-of-living measure with an economic dividend. It will help get women back into the workforce, unlocking an army of skilled workers our economy is crying out for. It's good for kids, it's good for families and it's good for the economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Might I say that I'm absolutely gobsmacked by what is transpiring as we sit here today in the lower house with respect to the investments and the disclosures made by the Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus MP. What is happening in terms of this issue in the lower house is absolutely extraordinary. There was, in history, a famous affair called the Dreyfus Affair, in relation to a Captain Dreyfus, who was wrongly accused of doing the wrong thing in the turn of the 20th century, but it will be very interesting to see how this unravels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're finding out is that the Attorney-General appears, through his self-managed super fund, to have held a material interest in a managed fund called Greencape, which holds just over nine per cent of the shares or about $100 million worth of a company known as Omni Bridgeway, which provides class-action litigation funding. This is extraordinary—absolutely extraordinary! The Attorney-General!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked a question of Senator Wong in relation to the definition in the ministerial code of conduct, where it clearly says that the fund or trust must not invest to any significant extent in a business sector that could give rise to a conflict of interest with the minister's public duty. The Attorney-General is not permitted, under the ministerial code of conduct, to have an interest in a fund which invests in an entity which has a material potential conflict with the discharge of his duties. Here we have the Attorney-General of the country, through his self-managed super fund, with an investment in a fund called Greencape, which actually has a material interest in a class action litigation funder. This is extraordinary stuff. This could be the end of this Attorney-General. It is extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this as someone who in a previous life was a company secretary and used to have responsibility of oversight of the company share trading policy. I can tell you, in terms of interpreting 'significant extent' from a general application in the corporations world, an interest of five per cent is considered material. In fact, any increase over five per cent in increments of one per cent has to be released to the Australian Stock Exchange through an announcement. It's considered a substantial shareholding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a situation where the federal Attorney-General, through a self-managed superannuation fund, has an interest in a fund which owns nine per cent of a litigation funder. This is extraordinary. I don't see how he gets a way out of this. I don't see a way through this for the Attorney-General. On a plain reading of the ministerial code of conduct, he's in clear breach. This is not de minimis, this is not a few hundred bucks—a little one per cent here or there—this is an interest in his self-managed super fund which holds an interest in a fund that holds nine per cent of a litigation funder. The Attorney-General—you don't get away from that. Of all the ministers, I can excuse to some extent Assistant Minister Ayres, but for the Attorney-General to appear, on the face of it—and I'm looking at the article from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> newspaper by James Massola on 8 September 2022 at 2.42 pm—this is extraordinary. The Dreyfus affair—this will be known as the Dreyfus affair. Just as Captain Dreyfus ended up on the literal Devil's Island in French Guiana, I suspect Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus is going to end up in the Devil's Island of the ministerial code of conduct. You don't come back from this. This is a material interest. This is a significant interest. That's what the code says. Senator Wong said it's all about intention. Yes, it is. It is, and I expect the Attorney-General, the first law officer in this nation, to actually discharge his responsibilities and understand the significance. Nine per cent? He owns an interest in a fund that owns nine per cent of a litigation funder. Absolutely extraordinary. The Dreyfus affair 2022.</span>

                  </a>  No, I'm quite happy to. I don't want to be interjected on while I'm making my remarks, through you, Mr Deputy President. We have looked at this debate. These questions that have been asked of Mr Dreyfus—he has disclosed in his member's interests register everything that is required of him. On the other hand, we have seen countless episodes from members in the Liberal Party where we've been unable to even have a public debate about the nature of a conflict of interest, because they have squirrelled and hidden away their interests and their vested interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mark Dreyfus, our Attorney-General, has been absolutely clear and transparent about his interests, and he has said very clearly that he expects to have to divest those interests if—if!—it should be satisfied that there is a perception of a conflict of interest, according to the requirements of the code.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This high standard that the Attorney-General has set and that this government has set is not a standard that those opposite were ever prepared to hold themselves to. There was not even a provision in the code of conduct of the previous government that would see someone divesting themselves of shares because of any perceived conflict of interest. We've seen this over and over again. Those opposite have had inherent conflicts of interest as ministers in the cabinet, making decisions whilst owning shares.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have set a high standard, and there's nothing wrong with probing the merits of that here in question time. That's fine. That's appropriate. But we have a collective responsibility in this place—be we senators, members of the executive or not—to bear in mind what has gone on for decades before. We are pursuing, under the Prime Minister, a divestment process where these matters are ultimately asked about, and that is indeed what is taking place. Those opposite never held themselves to account in such a way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong, in responding to those questions, was very clear in what she said. The minister outlined that those questions have been asked about a number of ministers in the House this week and that they have been appropriately answered, based on the accountability of the ministerial standards. I liked the colour and flavour in Senator Wong's answer, where our leader said, 'That doesn't satisfy your thirst for some political chutzpah, that we should have such straightforward, clear, transparent processes.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all very well for those opposite to seek to get some political mileage out of this, when they have never ever sought to set a decent standard at all. To that end, under the last government we did not ever see a national anticorruption commission that could also have oversight of such matters. We are very clear and positive in our duty to introduce legislation to establish a powerful, transparent and independent national anticorruption commission in the next session of parliament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But in the first hundred days it seeks to abolish the mechanism for establishing integrity on our construction worksites. It says: we're going to abolish the construction industry watchdog. Then it says it's going to remove measures of transparency introduced by the coalition over the superannuation industry. On one day they want to be committed to integrity, but on the following days, by their actions, they remove mechanisms of integrity in our country. Wow!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had three parliamentary sitting weeks—just three parliamentary sitting weeks—and we now have five ministers, including assistant ministers, who are in breach of a ministerial code signed by the Prime Minister himself. We are seeing a conga line of Labor ministers in breach of the ministerial standards: in this place, Senator Ayres, the Assistant Minister for Trade; in the other place, Mr Bill Shorten, the Minister for Government Services and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We've heard comments in regard to the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care. Add to that the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories. Just three weeks of sittings, and already it is one, two, three, four, five ministers—five members of the executive government. Add to that Senator Scarr's contribution on the latest development, in just the last 45 minutes, with regard to the Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus. Labor said at the election that it would make permanent and much-needed changes to standards of integrity and accountability in government. Labor said it would have the lowest tolerance for core integrity standards in government. Judge Labor not on what they said but on what they now do.</span>

Well, the measure of integrity is not what you're going to do but the standard that you apply to those new measures. Mr Albanese, as the new Prime Minister, would do well to learn the lessons of past leaders in our country. And we would hope—it is our great ambition—that every day, every week, every year the standards of integrity in our parliament and our community are lifted. But these breaches of the ministerial code are a dangerous precedent, and they deserve a stronger response from the Prime Minister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  It never ceases to amaze me that senators from the opposition can come in here and try to lecture the new Labor government about integrity. The previous speaker talked about learning from past leaders. Well, I can say one thing for sure—that those people on this side and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will not take any lessons from Scott Morrison, from Malcolm Turnbull or from Tony Abbott. We have set a very high standard when it comes to the ministerial code of conduct. We also have set out to the Australian people our plan when it comes to legislating a national anticorruption commission. We will deliver on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's not forget that the integrity of a government doesn't lie just with a ministerial code of conduct. Let's not forget the waste and rorts—and that's clearly what they were; they were rorts by the former government. So, the hypocrisy of those on that side—to come into this chamber and try to sing their virtues: 'We did nothing wrong.' Let's also talk about the dishonesty they perpetuate in this place in relation to the trillion-dollar debt they have left. This hasn't just been left to the Australian government, to the Albanese Labor government. This is a debt that has been bestowed on the Australian people. To come into this chamber, as they do, trying to say that this was all about the pandemic, is quite wrong. It is in fact a lie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's also not forget the $20 billion in JobKeeper money that was paid to companies who profited. Let's not forget about the lack of integrity and honesty of those opposite when they were in government in relation to the billions of dollars spent on the French submarines—but there were no subs. What they did deliver was a blow to the French government and the relationship between the two countries. Again, because of our government's integrity, because of the leadership of the Prime Minister, we have gone about renewing and restoring that relationship. Let's also not forget—because I think this is one that will stay in the Australian psyche for such a long, long time—the $660 million car park rorts. Those opposite were going to build these car parks where there were no trains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to come in here and lecture us about integrity and standards, then I would say that people in glass houses should not throw stones. Let's also go back to—what was it?—the $100 million sports rorts. These are the same people who come into this chamber to lecture us, as they did today in question time. I know there'll be a further contribution from those on the other side, but let's get real here. Do you really think that the Australian people are going to put their faith in what you say on the standards that your government set and that they would want to measure ours against those? Because they will not. They will not. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it takes a little while to get used to being in opposition. Those opposite are not very happy because today we have passed climate change legislation—another election commitment that we took to the federal election—and so they're all a bit sore and a bit narky today. I guess it's been another long week. The former senator reminded us that we've only had three sitting weeks. The reality is the Albanese Labor government are setting a very high standard, and we will work to make sure that our standards are upheld. But our standard is so much higher than anything that those opposite had when they were in government, and even that very low standard was never, ever met. </span>

When I first came into this place in 2019 what we saw on the other side was—how did Senator Cormann put it?—the seven stages of grief being displayed each and every day. What you can say about this side of the chamber is our tails are up. We're positive. We're fighting. We're holding this government to account, every time, every day. If we had more sitting days, you'd see them being held to account even more. Today people ask: why do you need to hold them to account? Well, we just learned of our fifth example today. </span>

                  </a>  It would go down in writing and then be codified in very many places in law. You'd think that our primary, our No. 1, legal officer in the land would have some idea of what 'significant extent' means. It's talking about materiality; it's not talking about, 'Oh, a little bit here or a little bit there.' It has an actual meaning, and that meaning is written in the ministerial code that the Prime Minister himself has signed, as my good friend Senator Smith has shown us today.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other side keep on talking about integrity, but talk is cheap, and we're seeing that daily from this government. They want to talk about integrity, they want to talk about parliament being a better place and they want to talk about it being more family friendly, yet last night we saw, with the help of the Greens, that they guillotined debate. The Greens even guillotined their own disallowance motion. They just got rid of their own disallowance motion. Really? This is transparency and a better parliament? I don't think so. Even the comments of my good friend Senator Hughes today in question time agreed that the way this government is acting towards people, particularly women in parliament, shows no respect. There's no respect even for their own code of conduct.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just an incredible show of hubris. They come in here and talk about this code and transparency and integrity, and, apparently, we're going to see an integrity commission come before the parliament sometime soon. Do we know when? We don't know when. They signed an agreement with Timor-Leste yesterday. I tried to get a copy of that cooperative defence agreement. It's not available. There is no transparency from this government, let alone with what's happening with their ministerial code of conduct, which seems to be—what did they say in the <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">irates of the Caribbean</span>?—something you lean to rather than something to be observed in the obvious.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're not going to take lectures from those on that side about integrity. We will look not at what they say; we will look at what they do. We will ask them to be transparent—we will demand that they're transparent—and we'll hold them to account in question time, in take note of answers and, in a few short weeks, in Senate estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Budget estimates, I might say, have been cut down from the normal two weeks, or eight days, to five or six days. They're not even going to allow us to hold them to account during Senate estimates. I'm just waiting for them to cut the hours of Senate estimates as well, to be a little bit more family friendly. But it won't be transparent, and it won't be integrity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher, to a question without notice I asked today relating to the national accounts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the ABS released the national accounts and the national accounts showed that the profits share of national income hit a new record high and that the wages share of national income hit a new record low. These are astonishing statistics. In the more than 60 years since records have been kept, never have businesses been getting a bigger slice of the pie and never have workers been getting a smaller slice of the pie. Workers are back, in terms of their share of national income, to where they were 60 years ago—60 years, and no progress. What did the RBA governor have to say about this astonishing statistic in a speech he gave today? Nothing—absolutely nothing. In fact, the word 'profit' wasn't even mentioned once. Instead, what Dr Lowe did is do what he's been doing so well this year, and that is running cover for corporate Australia. Here's what he said in his speech today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… business people are able to stand in the public square and say they are putting their prices up, and they can point to a number of reasons why. The community doesn't like it, but there is a begrudging acceptance. And with prices rising, it is harder to resist bigger wage increases, especially in a tight labour market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is truly gobsmacking stuff from Dr Lowe. You've got corporate profits at record highs, you've got wages at record lows, yet Dr Lowe is making up excuses for businesses to put up prices—just another high priest of neoliberal economics, as my colleague Senator Steele-John says. Dr Lowe, at the same time, is selling the fantasy of wage increases coming down the line. I wish he were right, but I don't expect that he is. He's blabbing on about the RBA's business liaison program, and he's ignoring the fact that wage rises are a fantasy, in part because he himself spends a fair bit of his time jawboning down wages. In July this year, he told workers they need to anchor their wage increase expectations at 3½ per cent, while at the same time saying inflation was going to be higher. Well, real wages are where they were 10 years ago in this country, and you've got the RBA governor out there making a case for real wages to go even further backwards. This is truly <span style="font-style:italic;">Alic</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Wonderland</span> stuff. It's hard to make sense of at times. But I did see one distillation of the situation that I thought had significant merit. It was a tweet from Mr David Taylor, who's a reporter with the ABC program <span style="font-style:italic;">The Drum</span>. Mr Taylor tweeted this out after Dr Lowe's speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How did we get to the point where it's OK for the RBA governor to warn publicly against rising wage growth without mentioning record profits</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We know profits are contributing to the vast bulk of inflation—real wages are going backwards</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I just don't get it</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Mr Taylor, I just don't get it either. And do you know who else I reckon doesn't get it? That's the vast majority of the Australian people, whose purchasing power is going backwards, and yet they just got smashed by a 50 basis points interest rate rise from the Reserve Bank, smashing mortgage holders, smashing renters, smashing small-business owners, to allegedly try and get on top of inflation, which is actually not being driven domestically by wages. It's being driven by corporate profits. I asked the minister today to acknowledge—and not for the first time, I might add—the role corporate profiteering and price gouging is playing in driving inflation, and yet again the minister would not, in her response, acknowledge the role that corporate profits are playing in driving inflation. We need truth and we need accountability in the system, and we're not getting it.</span>

These changes reduce the need for senators and staff to attend into the evening unless they are directly involved in the matters being debated. The committee also agreed that sittings should start at 9 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Private senators' bills will be dealt with on those mornings, with Monday mornings reverting to government business time. </span>

The motion I have moved would make the relevant amendments to the standing orders effective from October sittings. I commend the report to the Senate. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243273" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  Today I want to inform the Senate of an extraordinarily inspiring event that I was privileged to be part of this morning. This morning, seven-year-old Jeremy Carr from North Brighton in South Australia addressed the Power of Speech Breakfast here in Parliament House. He told us that he loved skateboarding and BMX. He plays soccer. He loves baking zucchini muffins. He wants to be a car designer when he grows up, preferably for Lamborghini. He spoke for five minutes with no notes. For any seven-year-old this is a pretty extraordinary accomplishment, but the fact that Jeremy was born bilaterally and profoundly deaf makes his story one of the most extraordinary stories of courage and immense inspiration. He won the Prime Minister's Award for Courage for his outstanding speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jeremy was joined by a number of other young people who were very inspiring in their own stories: Matthias Berndt from New Zealand, an incredibly articulate young eight-year-old; twins Evie and Lilla Harmsworth from Western Australia, who entertained the audience with a double act of comedy that was absolutely entertaining; Audrey, a bubbly, bubbly young lady from Queensland who wants to be a singer; Harper Rollinson from New South Wales, who lost her hearing as a result of treatment for cancer but who certainly hasn't lost her sense of humour; and Abigail Loganathan from the Northern Territory, a cheeky and talented eight-year-old.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories that these kids told us were absolutely inspiring to hear. They're real-life examples of the ways that good policy and focused investments can allow people to better connect with the full scope of life's opportunities and interests. That's because all of these children are cochlear implant recipients. The children spoke at the Power of Speech Breakfast here in Canberra, which was hosted by First Voice and sponsored by Cochlear. It celebrates the remarkable outcomes for cochlear implant recipients. The event was MC'd by Rosie Gallen, herself a beneficiary of cochlear implants. I give a really big shout-out to First Voice and its chair, Jim Hungerford, for their longstanding commitment to improving and enriching the lives of children who are deaf or hearing impaired. Their strong advocacy, their leadership and their role in informing meaningful public debate and health policy have changed the lives of so many young Australian children. I extend the same gratitude to Cochlear for its work as a global leader in hearing solutions, having provided over 600,000 implantable devices that are helping people of all ages live full and active lives. Thanks to Cochlear, the lives of children with hearing impairment are a world of possibility, not one of limitation as they used to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a message from the kids to Cochlear. They really want the new and improved version of the implants to be waterproof, because they really love swimming. So, if you could just do that, you'd make it absolutely perfect. But I have to say that was the only thing that the kids were asking for. Their lives have been changed. They acknowledge it, and they were so happy for the experience that they now have that enables them to hear like other kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the role of governments to invest in medical research, supporting early intervention to ensure that those born with hearing impairment can get the best out of life. I strongly believe in the importance of looking to people's ability rather than disability, and these children should be our inspiration in ensuring we support Australians through our investment in the NDIS and how we ensure its viability into the future. Thank you, Jeremy and all the other kids, for inspiring us to keep focused on that goal.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  I seek to speak to the government response to the Intelligence and Security Joint Committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim </span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">inquiry into extremist movements and radicalism in Australia</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has responded to the recommendation that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security consider an inquiry into extremist movements and radicalisation in Australia. The growth, in particular, of right-wing radical extremism in Australia has been a matter of very real concern, I know, to my party and to many people in the community that we speak to. It is particularly troubling, though, that this inquiry will be done under the cloak of the secrecy of this committee, without the broad representation that is necessary to deal with the threats of extremism. This will, of course, go to the club that is the Parliament Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—the club that's been established between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party; the club that has fed the beast that is the growing surveillance state, the growing security laws, the increased resourcing and empowering of security and intelligence agencies in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, that growing body of laws, agencies, budgets and staff that is there, apparently and purportedly to keep us safe, has been conspicuously failing to deal with the growth of right-wing extremism. We have seen repeated calls from across the community for some of the most offensive right-wing extremist organisations to be dealt with as terrorist organisations, as they have been in other, comparable countries. But there is the inexplicable refusal of the previous government or this government to step up and do the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we know from this very brief interim report into extremist movements and radical movements in Australia? Well, we know—and this is from the Director-General of Security—that, in the two most recent annual threat assessments and, in fact, as recently as March of last year, the director-general stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the enduring threat from religiously motivated violent extremists is a growing assortment of individuals with ideological grievances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I stop there to ask: why is it 'so-called'? It just is right-wing extremism. It's not so-called right-wing extremism; it is right-wing extremism. But I continue:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">So-called right-wing extremism has been in ASIO's sights for many years, and last year I called out what we have been seeing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I'm just going to stop there. It may have been in ASIO's sights, but there's no evidence that, having viewed it, ASIO has taken the steps appropriate to deal with it, or, if they have, they haven't persuaded the government to make adequate responses, having observed it. I go back to the comments of the director-general, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since then, ideological extremism investigations have grown from around one-third of our priority counter-terrorism caseload, to around 40 per cent. This reflects a growing international trend, as well as our decision to dedicate more resources to the emerging domestic threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in February 2022, the director-general stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The most likely terrorist attack scenario in Australia over the next 12 months continues to be a lone-actor attack—and that fact weighs heavily on my mind and the minds of our staff …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He then says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most of the radicalisation occurs online …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is inexplicable, in those circumstances—given the threats of right-wing extremism and given the appalling attacks we've seen on democracy and on civil society by right-wing extremist elements—that, whilst Canada and New Zealand have moved and listed the right-wing extremist organisation Proud Boys as a terrorist threat, there's been zero action from the Australian government. Indeed, when this government was in opposition, as I'm sure you will remember, Acting Deputy President McGrath, we heard a lot of noise from the then Labor opposition shadow, saying: 'Why isn't the government listing these extremist right-wing organisations? Why haven't they taken action?' Where's the action from this government? New Zealand and Canada have listed Proud Boys. We're still waiting. Right-wing extremism is growing, our security agencies are not addressing it and this government, to date, has been silent.</span>

This report is pretty damning of the last lot, isn't it?

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of these missed targets, the underestimations and the untimely planning is 14,214 deaths from, or with, COVID-19. That is 14,000 people taken far too soon from their families with a virus that could have been stopped had the previous government acted in time and if they had listened to the warning signs given by the disability community, who knew from day one of this pandemic that there was the most mortal danger that we would be left behind by a government that so continually failed to incorporate lived experience into its planning processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is 14,000 people gone, including people like the incredible disability advocate and leader John Moxon, whose loss has devastated our community this week. I want to take the opportunity to offer my sincerest condolences to Margaret, to Bruce and to everyone who loved him so dearly. Rest in power, John. It's one of the great regrets of my life so far that I didn't get a chance to know you more than I did or to learn from you more while you were with us than I had the opportunity to. We have lost so many people it is often too hard to think about. COVID-19 isn't close to being over. How is it that our state and federal governments have become so good at ignoring the reality of this deadly situation? Everyone deserves to be able to participate in society safely, comfortably and fully, and the Australian government should be working towards this end.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report sets out in writing what so many in our community already know—that the previous government had no previous serious plans to provide vaccines to those who needed them. The previous government clearly and evidently mismanaged the rollout. They underestimated the entire process, and only when we were already in the thick of it, with vaccines having been available for months, did they start to make any kind of decent progress for those who needed these vaccinations the most. I urge this government not to do the same now as we face the continuation of this virus and of long COVID and the extensive symptoms and suffering for thousands.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by speaking directly to anybody—in fact, to the tens of thousands who I know in the disability community are immunocompromised, who feel as though the nation, the conversation, has left them behind and is quite happy to see people pass away from COVID-19, as long as the rest of the business community is no longer inconvenienced. I want you to know that the Greens understand that for you this pandemic is not over, that COVID-19 is still keeping you in your homes. I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise to speak to the Auditor-General's <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">er</span><span style="font-style:italic;">formance audit: Australia’s COVID-19 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">vaccine rollout</span>. I have to say I was shocked when I heard that the Auditor-General had even done a report into the rollout, because the Auditor-General wouldn't know what he's talking about. We should also remember that the Auditor-General is an ex-Labor staffer who has been shown in the past to be partisan, as we saw with the Leppington Triangle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make this very clear. The World Health Organization came out in September 2020 and said that the vaccine would not be ready for another nine months because there needed to be greater safety testing. They needed to do much more safety testing of the vaccine. Lo and behold! Six weeks later, about a week after President Biden was elected and after trying to find a vaccine for 40 years, three different pharmaceutical companies had suddenly found a vaccine. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a bit too much of a coincidence for my liking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Senator Steele-John to be saying that the Morrison government didn't do everything it could to roll out the vaccine in time, when just six weeks earlier the World Health Organization had been saying that the vaccine wouldn't be ready till June 2021, is complete rubbish. How can you make a plan when there hadn't been a vaccine, when a vaccine hadn't even been invented? They had been searching for a vaccine for up to 40 years, and they certainly have never used an mRNA encased in a lipid at all. So to suddenly blame the Morrison government for not rolling out a vaccine that wasn't properly tested on immunocompromised people—remember that, Senator Jordon Steele-John? It wasn't tested on immunocompromised people. It wasn't tested on people who were getting anti-immune tablets at all. So for you to be claiming it wasn't rolled out fast enough isn't actually true at all. As it turns out, we still have had one of the lowest COVID death rates in the world—not because of the vaccine, I might add, but because we kept the country locked down for two years.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best part of the country was locked down for two years, and you're still complaining—you and your mate the Auditor-General, who we know can't be trusted because he couldn't actually know the difference between an agricultural zone and an industrial zone and he ran partisan politics. I will be writing to the Auditor-General about his inability to remain impartial. Why would he suddenly find the urgency to have to do a report into the rollout of the COVID vaccine? This guy would not have a clue, and we should also point out that he never once talked on what the TGA did. I will quote that Pfizer never tested the spike protein in humans. How can you roll out something that's never been actually tested on somebody and then say it's safe and effective? But did the Auditor-General raise that? No. I would suggest that the Auditor-General should really take a good look at his own position. I don't think it's right that he stays in this position, given than he's an ex-Labor staffer. He was a staffer back in the late eighties for a Hawke-Keating government minister. I think, because he's meant to be impartial, he should reconsider his position. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHOEBRIDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I wish to continue my remarks on the interim report of the Royal Commission on Defence and Veteran Suicide. The royal commission's interim findings are both shocking and sobering—deeply sobering. What they show is a system that is failing veterans. The Australian government has spent some $14.4 billion on wars in the Middle East, including Afghanistan, since 2001. That includes $8.5 billion on military operations just in Afghanistan and more than $4 billion on operations in Iraq. While the country is spending billions of dollars to send mostly young people off to fight wars in far-off countries, we are failing to properly support veterans when they return home, fundamentally changed and, in many cases, deeply traumatised by their service. It's a tragic fact that more current and former ADF members have died by suicide than in combat in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission in its interim report—and I commend the commissioners for the work they have done, for the sensitivity of their report and for their survivor focused approach to the royal commission—identified over 50 previous reports, conducted since just 2000, that are relevant to the topic of suicide and suicidality amongst serving and ex-serving members of the ADF. It also noted more than 750 recommendations and found that most of these recommendations have not been implemented. Indeed, the royal commission was limited in how it could review particularly reports of this parliament because of the operation of parliamentary privilege, and has made urgent recommendations to the government to seek to lift parliamentary privilege to be able to appropriately scrutinise and reflect upon the reports and recommendations of committees of this parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen since 2000, in those 50 previous reports and 750 recommendations that were largely unimplemented, is, in fact, two decades of failure. As the commissioners noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have been dismayed to come to understand the limited ways that Australian Governments have responded to these previous inquiries and reports</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And dismayed they were. The royal commission has heard damning evidence demonstrating that the system that's meant to be there to help veterans is, instead, too often harming them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't hold the current government responsible for the mess that the system is in. They've inherited it. Yes, there may be some culpability going back over a decade, but the veterans I've spoken to don't hold the current government responsible for the mess. But I and they do hold the government responsible for stepping through and fixing it and responding with urgency to the recommendations from the interim report of the royal commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way the Australian government is currently dealing with veterans' claims for compensation and rehabilitation was found by the royal commission to be a contributing factor to defence suicides. Let's just pause and reflect on that for a moment. The system that is meant to be there to help veterans is instead contributing to veteran suicide—a double failing of the duty that we have to those people who have served. That's a shocking conclusion. Indeed, as the interim report shows, there are currently some 41,799 outstanding claims. Some have been outstanding for well over 300 days. Indeed, that number has almost doubled in less than two years. Yes, some efforts are currently being made by the department to increase staffing and respond to that. But the backlog doubling in just two years and the delay that that causes in veterans getting urgent treatment and having their health prioritised is a significant part of the harm that has been delivered to veterans. Veterans are too often left to deal with the traumatic experiences of war and then are further traumatised by the system's failure to appropriately respond, compensate and, importantly, rehabilitate them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As one veterans advocate said, this waiting time is the damaging fact for a lot of veterans. They're sitting there hanging on, waiting so that they can go to the doctor and find out exactly what's wrong with them and get it paid for and get looked after. This is what they're waiting on. They're waiting on treatment. They're waiting on being helped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Survivors of abuse within the ADF face similar injustices and interminable waits, sometimes stretching out five to 10 years. They struggle, equally, against broken systems and a culture that permits abuse and exacerbates trauma by obstructing calls for support, fair compensation and accountability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can and must do better. The government can and must urgently respond to the recommendations of the interim report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians will see this new approach right across government—and the Treasury space is no exception. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that Australian businesses are desperate for clearer guidance on reporting the climate risks impacting their operations. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's why we are working closely with regulators to develop a standardised approach to climate disclosures for businesses—for a framework that is clear, credible and globally comparable. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And, importantly, our Government will restore the Treasury's role in modelling climate risks and opportunities for the Australian economy—rebuilding this capacity after it was left to decay by the previous government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Treasury modelling will help make sure we are charting a path that grabs the opportunities for growth and jobs that climate action offers. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill implements the Albanese Government's election commitment to provide a fringe benefits tax exemption for eligible electric cars that are made available by employers for employees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986</span> to provide an exemption from fringe benefits tax for this purpose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The exemption applies to battery electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars that are below the luxury car tax threshold for fuel efficient cars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The exemption will apply to fringe benefits arising from the use or availability of an eligible electric car from 1 July 2022—provided that the car was first made available for use on or after that date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will ensure that employers providing employees with an eligible electric car will not have to pay fringe benefits tax on that car—and the cost to employees of entering into salary sacrificing arrangements in order to lease an eligible electric car will now be less than it previously would have been. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a model valued at about $50,000 is provided by an employer through this arrangement, our fringe benefits tax exemption would save the employer up to $9,000 a year. For individuals using a salary sacrifice arrangement to pay for the same model, their saving would be up to $4,700 a year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fringe benefit tax exemption for eligible electric cars will be implemented as an ongoing measure. It will be reviewed after three years, in light of higher rates of electric car take-up, to ensure it remains effective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fringe benefit tax exemption is one component of the Government's Electric Car Discount, and forms part of our Powering Australia Plan—being delivered by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Electric Car Discount also includes the removal of five per cent tariffs for eligible electric cars with a customs value below the luxury car tax threshold for fuel efficient vehicles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Electric Car Discount package aims to help encourage greater take-up of electric vehicles and reduce transport emissions—as part of the Government's broader climate action agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures help reduce the upfront and ownership costs of electric cars, addressing a significant barrier to buying electric cars in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Electric Car Discount is one of the first new initiatives in the Government's plan to improve electric vehicle uptake, with further measures to be delivered as part of the National Electric Vehicle Strategy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This includes a $500 million investment to boost electric vehicle charging infrastructure right across Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our Government has also committed to ensuring 75 per cent of new Commonwealth fleet purchases are electric by 2025. This will increase the number of second-hand electric vehicles on the market, providing more options for consumers and driving down prices in the coming years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The transport sector is one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions in Australia, and the stronger uptake of electric vehicles can make a substantial impact in our efforts to tackle climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet right now, Australia lags far behind our international peers when it comes to electric vehicle use. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">About 15 per cent of cars sold in the United Kingdom are electric and plug-in hybrids. In Australia, it's only about two per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Obviously, we are very different countries in terms of our transport networks and needs—but even so, two per cent is much, much lower than it could be, and should be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More and more Australians are interested in the benefits of owning an electric vehicle—but they remain unaffordable for many motorists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are only 10 electric and plug-in hybrid cars on the domestic market selling for less than $60,000—whereas in the UK, there are about two dozen under this price. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because they have policies and incentives to help increase the take-up of electric vehicles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And now, Australia does too. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Accelerating electric vehicle uptake will help pave the way for a lower-cost transition to our emissions reductions targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is good for motorists, good for employers and their workers, and good for climate action. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wester</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">n Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I rise today to make a contribution on the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. This matter has a lengthy history. A decision was made in this place 25 years ago to pass the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, which amended the right of Australia's territories to legislate in this space. The intent of this bill is to undo that decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament has seen nine separate attempts over the last 18 years to hand the territories power to legislate assisted suicide. The first was in 2004, and the most recent was just last year. The bills were either voted down or scrapped. It must be pointed out that this bill has made another comeback under the guise of restoring rights to territorians. But ultimately it cuts through one of the very core values of our country which have been held since Federation: the sanctity of life. This bill is only about giving those living in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory access to assisted suicide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally I will not be supporting this bill, and that position comes from a deep and personal conviction. Under no circumstance could I ever support a human being ending their own life, whether it's sanctioned by the government or not, and it simply does not sit right with my conscience. I believe life is sacred and life should not end on anyone's terms: not your own, not the doctor's and not the government's. The outcome of signing a paper by a doctor is the same as dying by any other method. Euthanasia is a relatively new practice in Australia, and it is one that is changing the way we view health care. Instead of investing in better palliative care in Australia, this bill puts that very thing at risk. If we continue to view euthanasia as a palliative care alternative, we will discourage further investment and research and better care for those who need it. In 2018 my colleague Senator Patrick Dodson told this place:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… more needs to be done to ensure that First Nations people are receiving palliative care within their communities. Where First Nations people are already overrepresented at every stage of our health system, it is irresponsible to vote in favour of another avenue to death. Paving the way for euthanasia and assisted suicide leaves First Nations people even more vulnerable, when our focus should be on working collectively to create laws that help prolong life and restore their right to enjoy a healthy life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Dodson reflects on the grave disadvantages of euthanasia for Indigenous Australians, but these issues apply to all Australians. If we choose euthanasia as an acceptable palliative care option, then over time it will depreciate the value that we place on life. Intended or not, once you start something it always finds a way to advance itself. I do not believe that the sponsors of this bill intend to cause any harm, but over time as more people access euthanasia, Australians will become desensitised to its use as a genuine end-of-life option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Netherlands made euthanasia legal in 2001, and in 2005 they became the first country to decriminalise euthanasia for children. In Belgium, euthanasia was made legal for adults or, under rare conditions, emancipated minors in 2002. In 2014 they amended euthanasia laws to allow voluntary child euthanasia without any age restriction. The child can request it and verify that they understand what they're asking for, and with the parents and doctor's consent the child is euthanised. Over 27,000 people have been euthanised in Belgium since the laws were passed in 2002, and almost one in five of those were not expected to die of natural causes in the immediate future. People are now accessing euthanasia for psychological conditions, and this extract is drawn from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Journal of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Medicine </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy</span>, volume 46, 2021:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another point of controversy is the fact that the Belgian Euthanasia Law allows euthanasia for both physical and psychological suffering, but does not specify how the difference between the two should be conceived. The absence of any consensus or legal guidance on how to define psychological suffering makes it possible to use the concept in an increasingly broad way. Available empirical evidence and reports show that euthanasia is performed increasingly frequently in cases of psychological suffering (e.g. for schizophrenia, borderline disorder, or depression)</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These mental health issues are, sadly, increasingly common here in Australia. However, what's distressing is that these conditions are treatable but the Belgian government allow these patients to euthanise themselves in the name of compassion or human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think anyone here would want to see Australia go down this path—the path towards an on-demand assisted suicide. But I remind this place that the territories do not have the same degree of checks and balances as the states do. We must ask ourselves: if we allow the territory authorities to pass assisted suicide laws, can we guarantee that the appropriate safeguards and checks will be in place to protect Australians? No, we cannot. The Australian Capital Territory government is the first and only government to have decriminalised the possession of small amounts of illicit drugs like ice, heroin and cocaine, the drugs that have caused so much pain and destruction in our community. How can we ensure that Chief Minister Barr does not take legislation of assisted suicide to the extreme, like we've seen him do with his drug laws?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking past my personal objections, our Constitution grants powers to the Commonwealth to make laws for the government of any territory. We've been given a great responsibility over our territories to make sure that there is a sufficient level of accountability. Passing this bill and granting the territories the right to legislate assisted suicide laws with limited accountability, in my view, is a risk far too high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to remind the chamber that, only two years after the Hon. Kevin Andrews introduced the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, the Northern Territory held a referendum to decide if it should become a state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It's pertinent to note that the Labor opposition of the day supported the 'no' campaign. Accordingly, the good people of the Northern Territory narrowly voted it down, and the result of this referendum meant that the Commonwealth continued to retain its oversight of this matter. I do not support this change. Do not pretend that this bill is about giving the same rights that states have to territories when the Northern Territory had the opportunity to have those rights but declined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having listened to the other contributions when we started this debate earlier in the week, I want to reflect on the fact that this debate has been engaged in in a very respectful way. I understand that there is a real diversity of views on this matter. People will come at this from all sorts of different perspectives, and I respect the fact that we are able to have a debate as important as this and do it in a respectful way. The discussion on this matter is of course very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I encourage all senators to truly consider what's at stake here. Do we want to set ourselves on a path that could lead us in the same direction as that of other countries around the world—I cited the situation in Belgium—where we end up providing euthanasia, assisted suicide, for people with clinical diagnoses of depression, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses? As we've seen, there are countries where children are able to access these services. There's no law in Australia right now in any state that would allow that, but that's the point. The passage of this legislation here would enable the ACT and the Northern Territory to put in place laws without the same checks and balances that there are in the states, which could quite easily allow for an even greater move towards use of those services without limitations. I don't think that that is something that we'd want to see. So I urge senators, when you consider where you're going on the conscience vote that's appropriately before us here, to consider all of these matters, and I urge you to vote against this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  If I can begin by making a couple of comments about Senator O'Sullivan's contribution on the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, I want to make it very clear that I've done a lot of work over many years with both Palliative Care Tasmania and Palliative Care Australia. The issue in this debate is that palliative care and voluntary—I underline 'voluntary'—assisted dying are not mutually exclusive. In fact, palliative care can be a great resource in the area of voluntary assisted dying. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my Labor colleagues in the House who introduced this bill: the member for Ballarat, Ms King, and the member for Eden-Monaro, Ms McBain. It's hard to believe that it is now 27 years since the Northern Territory parliament passed the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. It was the first state or territory in Australia to legislate for and regulate the process of voluntary assisted dying. It's not euthanasia and it's not suicide; it's voluntary assisted dying. After the act was passed and before it was overridden by the federal parliament, seven people sought assistance to end their lives under the act. All seven had advanced stages of cancer. Of the seven, four were able to use the provisions of the act to end their lives. Another two sought assistance but died before the act became law, and one died after the act was repealed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory's act had been in force for almost two years when the Australian parliament passed the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997. The federal act prevented not only the Northern Territory but also the ACT and Norfolk Island from passing laws to allow for voluntary assisted dying. Since the bill was introduced there have been many attempts in this parliament, through private members' and private senators' bills, to repeal the provisions of the Euthanasia Laws Act and restore the rights of the territories. I won't at length go into those various attempts to do that, but I will say this: in 2016 a bill was introduced, this time a collaborative effort between Senator Di Natale and Labor Senator Gallagher, but, like most of the others, wasn't proceeded with. In 2021, during the last parliament, Nationals Senator Sam McMahon introduced the Ensuring Northern Territory Rights Bill. While there was some progress on the second reading debate, that bill did not come to a vote. The one bill that did make it to a division, Senator Leyonhjelm's bill, was negatived by a margin of only two votes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we've been grappling with the issue of the rights of the territories to legislate for voluntary assisted dying, we have had extensive debates on the issue in all state parliaments. I think Senator O'Sullivan comes from Western Australia. In fact, Western Australia has voluntary assisted dying laws, so it's alright for the state that he lives in to have it. We didn't get a say in this chamber on whether or not Western Australia got to do that, but, when it comes to the territories, we have to treat them differently. Every state parliament has now passed laws to provide some regulatory framework for suffering terminally ill people to seek assistance to end their lives. As I said, this chamber did not get a vote to determine what every state did, so why do we have to do that for the territories? These laws take effect in various states and are already in effect in two of the six states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Tasmania, the legislation which passed was developed by Legislative Council member Mike Gaffney, after a very long and very extensive community consultation process. This consultation process allowed the legislation to be very thoroughly scrutinised to ensure that the language was consistent and correct and that the checks and balances against misuse were watertight. The End-of-Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Act 2021passed the Tasmanian parliament last year and commences operation on 23 October this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will notice from the titles of the various repeal bills put forward in federal parliament that there have been a lot of terms used and bandied about, and, as I said, some of these are inappropriate. It's really important that we get the terminology correct. We're talking here about voluntary assisted dying. We're not talking about euthanasia or suicide, as I've mentioned. Those against it use that language to run the emotive argument, and I find that not tolerable. You have to understand the bill. You have to understand what the word 'voluntary' means. We're not forcing anyone to do it. You hear all these horror stories, but I don't understand why it's alright for all the states to be able to do it and not the territories. If anyone can explain to me why that's alright and give me a logical argument, I'm happy to listen, but I haven't heard a logical argument about it yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ending one's own life by suicide is usually the result of mental ill health such as psychosis or severe depression. Suicide is a tragedy—don't get me wrong—and every possible measure should be taken to reduce the incidence of suicide until we eliminate it entirely. By contrast, voluntary assisted dying is a rational act made by someone whose life-limiting illness is causing them intolerable pain or physical discomfort, and as a result they have no prospects for quality of life. Suicide tends to be preceded by isolation and loneliness—not always, but usually—whereas voluntary assisted dying usually brings patients closer to family and loved ones. As for euthanasia, this is a procedure used to kill someone painlessly to end their suffering. With voluntary assisted dying, the doctor provides the patient the means to end their life and thereby end their suffering, so ultimately the power to make the decision remains in the patient's hands. It's important we make these distinctions clear when we talk about voluntary assisted dying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Years ago I was actually opposed to voluntary assisted dying, but my views have changed. Some recent experiences, of course, have had a profound effect on my thinking about the topic of death and dying—how I die, how much dignity I have when I die, and how I may want the choice to be mine. I mean, I might get run over by a bus tomorrow! Heck, wouldn't there be a whole lot of people interested in my position? But if I've got the choice, and I'm in such severe pain, with no quality of life, then I want to be able to make that choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a few years ago I stayed for two weeks by the bedside of a very close personal friend who was dying in a palliative care suite. I'd known my friend for over three decades. We were partners in crime together for over three decades. I'd witnessed her cognitive decline over several years resulting from early-onset dementia. At the beginning of those two weeks she lost the ability to swallow, and the doctors expected her to only live for one other day. She held on for two weeks, receiving regular pain medication. It was a great relief to her loved ones when the suffering finally ended. I'd changed my view on voluntary assisted dying before this incident, but it had a profound effect on me nonetheless, and probably just served to reinforce my views.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing people die or dying changes your perspective on death. I used to be a nurse. I've seen people die. I've laid out the dead. I've seen people have to hang on, being kept alive with no quality of life, and I cannot accept that that has to be the way for the people in the territories if it doesn't have to be the way for the people in the states. But we've got a bit of a culture in Australia where we treat death as a taboo subject. We don't talk about it nearly enough, whereas in other cultures they're much more open about the subject. We even seek to substitute straightforward words like 'death' and 'dying' with euphemisms like 'passing away' or 'passing'. I'm committed to turning this around, as a lot of people in this chamber know. As co-convenor of Parliamentary Friends of Palliative Care for a number of years, I've spoken extensively about the need to plan for and discuss our end-of-life wishes in order to have a good death. We do it when we're having a baby. We have plans to have babies. People want women to have a good birth and a good experience. When it comes to dying, we should have the same respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of our discomfort with the idea of assisted dying is probably brought about by our discomfort with the idea of death generally and our reluctance to discuss it openly. I'm sure more people would be open to the idea of voluntary assisted dying if they openly discussed the topic of death as well as what their dying wishes are. That's why I love the idea of death cafes, an initiative that's gaining popularity, in which people get together over tea or coffee and have a frank, open discussion about death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More discussion about death would also help to overcome the pervasive misunderstandings about palliative care. I am disappointed to hear people voice suggestions that arguing for investment in quality palliative care is somehow an excuse for not rendering assistance to terminally ill patients to end their own lives. As I said, they're not mutually exclusive. It frustrates me because I'm both a supporter of voluntary assisted dying and a strong advocate for quality palliative care. I speak to palliative care people regularly, so I know they understand that palliative care can assist with voluntary assisted dying. As I said, it's not an either-or proposition. I do suggest, as I have earlier in my contribution, that these views are put forward by people who quite often have a very narrow understanding of what palliative care is. So, while I'm here, let me bust some of the myths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Palliative care is not just pain management and other care at the very end. It's not just for dying people in a hospital bed, and it's not just for old people. Palliative care is for anyone of any age, including children, who has a life-limiting illness. It can be provided to people in the final days or the final years of life. It can be provided in any setting: a hospital, an aged-care facility, a home or even out in the community. It addresses the physical, social, emotional, psychological, cultural and even spiritual needs of the patient. For example, if you've got a life-limiting illness and your dying wish is to go bungee jumping, having someone to take you bungee jumping could be a form of palliative care. For anyone listening, I hope this example helps to broaden your perspective on palliative care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having conversations about our dying wishes and investing in quality palliative care in Australia are two ways we can ensure that people with life-limiting illnesses have the best end-of-life experience possible. Isn't that what we want for them? Shouldn't we all want that for anyone with a life-limiting illness? Regardless of how good palliative care is, we know it will not end all the pain, all the suffering and all the discomfort. There is a need for other options for people whose quality of life cannot be assured. For many patients advocating for voluntary assisted dying, just the knowledge that this option is available gives them comfort and lessens their fear, even if they may never exercise that option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While in this contribution I've spoken at length about voluntary assisted dying, let's be clear that here we are debating not whether to legislate for assisted dying here but whether to allow the territories to do so, just as we allow the states to. This is not fundamentally a debate about voluntary assisted dying but a debate about territory rights. That much is made clear by the title of the bill. Going back to Senator Leyonhjelm's bill, I spoke in the debate on the second reading of that bill four years ago. I want to quote a paragraph from that speech. I said then:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I do not believe it's for me as a senator elected to this place to determine whether the Northern Territory or the ACT should legislate for voluntary assisted dying, just as it's not for me to determine whether Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales or Queensland should. It's not for me to decide whether the safeguards of the Northern Territory's or the ACT's assisted dying legislation are sufficient. I support this bill because I do not see it as fair to treat territorians as second-class citizens and to say to them: 'The states are mature enough to govern themselves, but you need federal oversight.' That is essentially what this parliament did when it passed the Euthanasia Laws Act in 1997.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to my speech, my fundamental objection to the Euthanasia Laws Act is that it created two classes of citizens in Australia: those who are governed on state matters by their state parliaments, and those who have federal oversight on matters that would normally be dealt with by their territory parliaments. I understand that the Constitution gives this parliament the power to deny territorians certain powers that are afforded to the states, but I see no compelling reason whatsoever for asserting those powers. As far as I'm concerned, doing so treats territorians as second-class citizens and it smacks of paternalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Constitution was adopted over 100 years ago. It's imperfect, but improving it is a difficult and expensive process. One way we can improve the operation of our Constitution without the expense of a referendum is through the conventions we choose to follow. I believe that giving the territories the same legislative powers as the states is a convention that we should agree to adopt and uphold, even if our Constitution allows us to do otherwise. It's worth noting that other speakers during the debate on Senator Leyonhjelm's bill supported the bill despite their personal opposition to voluntary assisted dying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge anyone in this place who opposes voluntary assisted dying to consider upholding the principle that territorians should have their own right to decide. After all, imagine if the tables were turned.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  This bill has challenged my thinking very deeply. I've come to this parliament to consider every piece of legislation that comes before us, and it is my obligation to the people of this country to pursue a deeper level of understanding of argument for and against each piece of legislation, never taking anything for granted, especially on an issue as serious as permitting society the ability to end human life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard very shallow arguments from my fellow federal Labor colleagues from the Northern Territory and our very own Northern Territory Labor Attorney-General, who claimed: 'This is purely about giving Territorians rights, and anyone who opposes this is effectively denying our rights as Territorians to make our own decisions.' In my opinion, taking a human life is far more serious an issue, deserving profound consideration, as opposed to political pointscoring or gaslighting to elicit a supporting vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given our Northern Territory Attorney-General, Chansey Paech, our Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, and the member for Lingiari, Marion Scrymgour, are of Aboriginal heritage, I would have hoped that they would consider the possible consequences for, and the current deeply held concerns of, the Territory's Aboriginal population, who are some of our most marginalised Australians. The Northern Territory has the highest proportion of Aboriginal Australians in the country, at 30 per cent of our population. The majority of this population consists of those whose first language is not English and who experience the lowest levels of education, the highest levels of unemployment and welfare dependency, the lowest life expectancy, the highest rates of domestic and family violence and the greatest health challenges in the nation. Voluntary assisted dying is incompatible with the Closing the Gap health and wellbeing targets of closing the gap in life expectancy within a generation by 2031, and significant and sustained reduction in suicide of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people towards zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory government are also charged with the responsibility of protecting the lives of Territorians, but have recently acted contrary to this duty, instead using human rights as the basis for their argument to allow alcohol to be consumed again in remote communities. They've argued that an alcoholic should have the right to drink themselves to death. And if that alcoholic is also a violent perpetrator, their potential to commit violence has been prioritised by this Territory government over the rights of the perpetrator's victims to live a life free from all forms of violence. It is a human right for every man, woman and child to live a life free from any form of violence, including alcohol related violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite desperate pleas from vulnerable community members and leading Aboriginal health and legal services, this Northern Territory Labor government, who now seek the right to debate voluntary assisted dying, completely ignored these pleas. I now field distressing calls on a regular basis from people who are experiencing the immediate consequences of the Northern Territory government's actions. These individuals and their communities are retraumatised by the alcohol fuelled violence that has returned to their communities. In two communities in central Australia, families have fled due to feuds. Children's lives are disrupted, as are the lives of those now being displaced. This is contributing to the gangs of children now back on the streets of my hometown, who are not attending school and who have no adult supervision. So you can forgive me for having no faith or confidence that this current Northern Territory Labor government is capable of determining legislation that lends itself to ending the lives of human beings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My other concern speaks to cases I have come to learn of in other countries like Canada, where laws allowing assisted dying have seen individuals who have been misdiagnosed with a terminal illness end their lives wrongfully; or cases where a prognosis has been delivered to a patient estimating they only have months to live, when, in fact, they have had years left, but the consequences of the initial prognosis has brought their lives to an end prematurely. There is the mental capacity of individuals seeking assisted dying to be considered. There have been cases of individuals who have ended their lives without involvement of family members, who, sadly, learned only after their loved ones had passed away that they had sought assisted dying. The mental capacity of these individuals was not known or considered by treating doctors, yet if family had known they still would not have been able to challenge their loved ones' request due to the legislation's determinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a niece in her early 30s whose kidneys collapsed some years ago. She has two children in their early teens. She decided recently that she no longer wanted to live and ceased attending her dialysis appointments. It was deeply concerning to us as a family that she had come to this conclusion. It was very likely the fact that the increased level of toxins in her blood due to avoiding dialysis was contributing to her inability to make sound decisions about her health. As her family, we did everything in our power to keep her alive. We had her committed to care and arranged counselling for her to better understand the need for her to keep fighting for her life and continue to be dialysed. Her children needed their mother. This is why I fight for better life outcomes and a better quality of life for all Australians, especially our most marginalised—to respect the sanctity of life by fighting to save lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I acknowledge that the other 70 per cent of the Northern Territory is not Aboriginal, I have a responsibility to all of our Territorians. The proposed repeal of Kevin Andrews's bill does not create equality between states and territories, as the following points show. First, territories and states are fundamentally different. The Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978, or NTA, is an act of the Commonwealth parliament and can be changed as parliament sees fit. State constitutions subsist under section 106 of the Constitution and are protected by it—they cannot be changed by the Commonwealth parliament. Second, the Commonwealth parliament has plenary power over the territories under section 122 of the Constitution. That can't be changed, save by referendum. By contrast, the Commonwealth parliament may legislate in matters affecting states only within the powers granted to it by section 51 of the Constitution or exclusive powers like defence. Third, the administrator of the Northern Territory is appointed by the Governor-General; state governors are appointed by the Queen. Fourth, by virtue of subsection 53(5) of the NTA, the Northern Territory parliament does not have power to confer on courts or tribunals powers to resolve employment disputes. That restriction remains. Finally, and importantly, under section 72 of the NTA the Commonwealth indemnifies the Territory in relation to any claim for damages which, but for the NTA, could have been brought against the Commonwealth. That means that the Northern Territory does not stand on its own two feet but is supported by the Commonwealth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, the Constitution demands that every one of us, the elected members of federal parliament, take greater responsibility for the territories within our nation than for our states—whether we like it or not. But if this bill is to pass, because of my very grave concerns I would urge any Northern Territory government that wishes to debate legislation for voluntary assisted dying to undergo thorough consultation with Territorians of all backgrounds—especially our most vulnerable constituents. I would also especially urge those who argue this bill is about supporting only the rights of Territorians that once you've determined the legislation you put it to the vote of the people of the Northern Territory so that it may truly reflect their wishes and rights.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I have thought more deeply about this issue than any other issue I have thought about in this place. I have changed my view from a past time, when I may have taken a more classically liberal approach with respect to matters such as this, to one where I reflect deeply on the threat to the most vulnerable in our community in relation to the passage of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill, the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, was only about the rights of territorians, it would not be a conscience vote. Recognition of this as a conscience vote includes a recognition that it is about something more than just the rights of territorians. I do not believe that the ends justify the means, nor do I believe that you should focus entirely on the means and disregard the ends, or the results of what happens. Hence, when I come into this place and consider an issue such as this, I consider it in terms of protecting the vulnerable. I consider the consultations with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, our First Nations people. I consider the unintended consequences of this legislation. I consider all of those issues. And in terms of those safeguards, in terms of consideration given to those issues, I see there is barely a page of consideration to those matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the Constitution of Australia places an obligation on us to consider whether or not the legislation that was introduced by a previous parliament should be repealed. We have the power therefore we have the responsibility, and it's up to each and every one of us to determine how we discharge that responsibility. And I pay tribute to Senator Nampijinpa Price with regard to her position, her ethical position. It would not have been an easy thing to do that, being a senator from the Northern Territory, and it has echoes of the great Edmund Burke who, when he had to speak to his constituents in Bristol in that famous speech, said: 'When I come to parliament I'm not just here as your cypher, I bring with me my own conscience. I have to apply my own wisdom to that which is before me.' I really do congratulate Senator Nampijinpa Price on that speech. I have material concerns in respect of voluntary assisted dying, and the more I look into it—and I have looked deeply—the more concerned I am across a number of bases. I think Senator Nampijinpa Price, her comments in respect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are very, very important to consider, and I'll be making some comments in that respect as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first point I want to make is that voluntary assisted dying is not entirely a private act. This is not like freedom of speech or freedom of religion because, by its very nature, in terms of the processes initiated through voluntary assisted dying, if you choose to go down that path you are involving others. You're involving the medical profession. You're involving the state, which has to have checks and balances to try to assess whether or not a person's consent is valid or invalid. You're placing obligations on a whole range of people. It is not just a single private act; this is broader than that. I will seek to bring that into stark relief shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also has national significance. We have international human rights obligations, which we have entered into, including in respect of the disabled that have been entered into by our country on a national level. We are the provider of the NDIS, which we hope provides services to our disabled such that they never get into a position where, because they haven't received adequate services, they are forced to choose—a Hobson's choice that the only way they can end the suffering because they haven't been provided adequate services is to go down the voluntary assisted dying route.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're the provider of health services. Palliative Care Australia, after the most recent election, wrote to the new government and said, 'Congratulations'—as they should do, as each association would do—'we hope you look at the shortage of palliative care services in this country.' So we are all put on notice. Everyone in this place is put on notice that there are inadequate palliative care services in this country at this point in time. What if a person is in that invidious position of trying to get access to palliative care services, concerned, scared of the pain, scared of the suffering when they haven't got access to that service? I say to you: we should make sure they've got access to those palliative care services first. That should be our primary responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to read to you from a very disturbing article from Canada, a First World country that in many ways is very similar to Australia. I make this point first. In Canada's annual report on medical assistance in dying, they give the statistics for the rates of medically assisted dying in Canada between its introduction in 2016 and 2021. The number of people accessing voluntary assisted dying in Canada has increased from 1,018 in 2016 to 10,064 in 2021, a tenfold increase. So let's have a look to see what is actually happening Canada. I quote from a very recent article by Maria Cheng, a medical writer with Associated Press:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">TORONTO (AP)—Alan Nichols had a history of depression and other medical issues, but none were life-threatening. When the 61-year-old Canadian was hospitalized in June 2019 over fears he might be suicidal, he asked his brother to "bust him out" as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Within a month, Nichols submitted a request to be euthanized and he was killed, despite concerns raised by his family and a nurse practitioner.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've got all the safeguards in Canada. We can have pages and pages of safeguards in legislation, but we have to ask ourselves: what is the practical reality? The article continues:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nichols' family reported the case to police and health authorities, arguing that he lacked the capacity to understand the process and was not suffering unbearably—among the requirements for euthanasia. They say he was not taking needed medication, wasn't using the cochlear implant that helped him hear, and that hospital staffers improperly helped him request euthanasia.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening in Canada, a First World country, at this point in time. I'll give you another example from this article on what is actually happening on the ground in Canada:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government provided Tagert, who had Lou Gehrig's disease, with 16 hours of daily care at his home in Powell River, British Columbia. He spent about 264 Canadian dollars … a day to pay coverage during the other eight hours.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"I know I'm asking for change," Tagert wrote in a Facebook post before his death. "I just didn't realize that was an unacceptable thing to do."</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It contains an extract from a written statement by Chips Mackinolty to the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs inquiry into euthanasia. Chips Mackinolty was charged by the Northern Territory with the obligation to go around to different Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory and consult with them in relation to the legislation which had been imposed or brought into effect in the Northern Territory. Following that consultation, even though personally he supported euthanasia, he was desperately concerned that voluntary assisted dying was inappropriate in the Northern Territory context. He was desperately concerned.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He found that out, of the 900 First Nations people he consulted with, only two gave any support to voluntary assisted dying. What was most troubling was the fact that he believed it could be totally counterproductive and that Aboriginal people might not attend health clinics because they'd be concerned with respect to what was associated with the health clinics. It could actually lead to that sort of additional dysfunction in that context. I'll quote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is worth noting, in this context, that private Aboriginal owned clinics have demanded, and received, written undertakings from staff that they will not participate in euthanasia so as to reassure patients that these clinics are 'safe' to attend. Legal and other reasons preclude this occurring in government clinics, and an attempt to amend the … legislation to exempt Aboriginal community clinics from participating in euthanasia failed to pass the NT Legislative Assembly.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  Four years ago, in August 2018, I stood in this place and spoke against a private senator's bill, the Restoring Territory Rights (Assisted Suicide Legislation Bill) 2015. That legislation failed, and not just because I voted against it. Now we have the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022 to consider. This bill will remove constraints on the legislative powers of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory—constraints that were enacted in 1997 in order that the Commonwealth overturn Northern Territory legislation which was the first in the world to legislate euthanasia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Four years ago—that is, more than two decades after the NT legislation was cancelled—euthanasia was legislated elsewhere across Australia. The Victorian parliament passed voluntary assisted dying legislation in November 2017, but it would not come into effect until June 2019. My home state of Western Australia was next. Legislation was enacted in December 2019, and I protested about that. Today every state in Australia has voluntary assisted dying legislation, although in some places the laws are yet to come into effect, so the landscape now is markedly different from that of four years ago. Euthanasia will soon be able to be practised in all parts of Australia—apart from the ACT and the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory legislation, back in the mid-nineties, was called the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act—ROTI was the acronym—and four people took advantage of it before the Commonwealth intervened. I recognise that the legislation before us now, the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, does not automatically revive the Northern Territory ROTI Act, but, as the explanatory memorandum spells out, it will ensure that the ACT and the Northern Territory parliaments will be able to allow their citizens the same rights as people living in the six states now hold. If the two territories want to follow suit, they will have the benefit of lessons from the legislation that the states have already worked upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally, I still hold the same reservations that I held four years ago about laws which license euthanasia or assisted dying, especially as they may affect First Nations peoples. But in the end I see euthanasia legislation as whitefella law, to be used by the non-Indigenous population. It's worth recording the research that was quoted previously by Senator Scarr. The research was into Aboriginal views on euthanasia, which was commissioned by the Northern Territory government when its ROTI Act was passed. The research team conducted 21 meetings across the Territory, involving 900 Aboriginal people from around 100 communities. They found that at least 90 per cent of those Aboriginal people opposed the legislation, as distinct from the 70 per cent support nationally for euthanasia. Palliative care was universally supported by Aboriginal people as the way people were traditionally cared for under their law, and that's still our way. We nurse our elderly into their death in our own communities, sometimes at great personal sacrifice. And remember this: in remote communities, as has already been alluded to, there aren't the palliative care services available that are supported elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in this place four years ago, any proposal by the Northern Territory to reintroduce assisted suicide legislation must occur in consultation with First Nations health services and communities because First Nations peoples are at a higher risk of being in a situation where assisted dying might take place. I said that four years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have pondered deeply how to approach the legislation before us now and, in spite of my fundamental spiritual opposition to euthanasia, I have never held to the slippery slope argument. I accept that adequate safeguards have been written into the laws that now prevail in the six states. They may not be adequate, but they're better than what was proposed. For that reason, and in recognition of the widespread non-Indigenous support for voluntary euthanasia, I intend this time to abstain from voting. I would not want to be the one person whose no vote sank this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about other factors that have come in to weigh upon my deliberation. Many of you here would have been lobbied by faith based organisations to oppose this legislation. Some of those lobbyists have invoked my advocacy—in particular, about the anathema of euthanasia in First Nations people—to support their cause. The Australian Christian Lobby, for example, has campaigned against this legislation under the headline 'Protect Indigenous lives'. Yet this very same organisation, which purports to be concerned about First Nations peoples, has been peddling offensive propaganda which scoffs at the Aboriginal spiritual beliefs and belittles arguments for a First Nations voice to this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Martyn Iles, the managing director of the Australian Christian Lobby, harangues his followers with video clips called 'The truth of it'. In an 18-minute rant back in June he railed against the Uluru Statement from the Heart as a 'pagan document', which he screwed up and tossed at the camera. A voice to parliament, Iles asserts, is 'the agenda of critical race theorists' who want to divide people on the basis of their skin colour and to implant, in his words, 'some kind of trouble, some kind of cancer' into an otherwise good system. Iles compounded his offence in another video only a couple of weeks ago when he said he eschews the welcome to country because it 'affirms paganism and entangles one in false spirituality'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been distressed by these scornful, hateful diatribes from so-called Christians, who are prepared to recruit First Nations peoples to support a campaign against euthanasia yet won't allow them a seat at the table. Those sorts of diatribes are injurious to respectful discussion. They have no place in our national discourse as we progress towards a referendum to entrench a voice in the Constitution. Those opponents of the Voice to the parliament say that it will be divisive. Those same opponents fail to recognise that their argument is in itself divisive. I say that rather than dividing us a voice will be an instrument of healing and reconciliation, a first step in the journey to resettle our relationship.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  I want to start by acknowledging the respect and consideration that has, in large part, been shown by others during this debate. As in all conscience debates, these are decisions and thoughts that weigh heavily upon us all, I'm sure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to discuss greater rights for the Northern Territory, but I have sincere reservations surrounding the possibility that euthanasia legislation will be a consequence. And while, as a North Queenslander and a northern Australian, I do have enormous sympathy for the cause of Territorians having greater autonomy without needing approval from the Commonwealth for the decisions they make, this is of course a result of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022 asks for more decision power on land acquisitions and employment disputes. I would normally think that this is an excellent move that would streamline the administration of the Territory and encourage productivity gains and development. But, as I said, I have sincere concerns with the other aspect of the bill, which will repeal the Commonwealth's rejection of the Territory's ability to legalise euthanasia. In all good conscience I cannot agree to figuratively hand a gun to someone knowing it would be used to end a human life, no matter the watertight legality of that person's being able to hold it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have reservations about assenting to this bill in its entirety until there is a much more serious discussion about the options to improve the range and availability of palliative care in the Northern Territory. Just this year, famed Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil was forced to undergo palliative care in South Australia, far from his Arnhem Land home, due to a lack of services. His family has described how distraught he was at not being able to die on country. It has been reported that this is a wide-ranging problem throughout the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In January this year, the ABC reported that the then federal government had pledged to improve care options across remote Australia but had stopped short of outlining any specific future plans. The Northern Territory government is also reluctant to promise any new facilities for palliative care in the Territory bush, but said they've recently improved the end-of-life care services in Alice Springs and Darwin. The spokesman also said that the Northern Territory government would support patients who wish to die at home on country, including with transport back to country if that is the request from patient and family, but a study into remote area palliative care by research body BMC Palliative Care found that Aboriginal people have a growing need for palliative care but struggle to have convenient access to it or even information about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to wonder exactly how much consultation euthanasia advocates have done with the Territory's population broadly and the Aboriginal population specifically. In the 1996 study by Territory government researcher Chips Mackinolty, referred to earlier by Senator Scarr, revealed that while so-called right-to-die advocates, of which he admits he was one, believed they could just travel around Indigenous communities educating people and be hailed as heroes, the results were the exact opposite. Twenty-one teams of researchers were tasked by the government with canvassing 900 Aboriginal people in the Territory. Of those 900 people, just two responded favourably to adopting the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. The main reason given was superstition based on tribal belief that killing someone, even via a medical procedure sanctioned by somebody wanting to die, was abhorrent. Furthermore, they feared that if killing someone with doctor administered drugs was made legal by the government, those drugs could be used by others, either by sinister people with evil motives or kadaitja men and sorcerers to commit murder. I appreciate that this is not a view held right across the Northern Territory, but I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we are protecting everyone—most importantly, the most vulnerable in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The findings also stated that allowing medical professionals, usually the most trusted in Aboriginal communities, to end life would erode that trust and lead to people delaying treatment or seeking alternative remedies. Indeed, once the concept of euthanasia was explained to them, many Aboriginal people stated they would not feel safe going to the doctor anymore, even for minor ailments. The report author, Mr Mackinolty—again, a staunch advocate of euthanasia—made the sobering conclusion that the Northern Territory was certainly the wrong jurisdiction to legalise assisted dying. He did not say 'arguably' or 'possibly'. He was unequivocal: 'The Territory was certainly the wrong jurisdiction.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What price do we pay for people delaying treatment, and ultimately becoming terminally ill, when early intervention could have saved their lives? How can we celebrate the Northern Territory having more of a say over its own destiny by knowing its most vulnerable people would be adversely affected by this aspect of the change?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other grave concern I have is that we are simply offering a solution that is easy compared to the much more difficult task of ensuring terminally ill Territorians can access all treatment options. The Northern Territory has the lowest life expectancy in the country—an average of 74 years, compared to 80.5 years right here in the ACT—and its population is spread out far and wide from main population centres. It should be a matter of human decency and responsible government to ensure that seriously ill people have the choice of a full suite of treatments, not influenced simply by where they live or their personal finances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I point the house to a recent development in Canada where reports have surfaced of people being encouraged to undergo euthanasia because they couldn't afford expensive treatment. In one case reported in the media, a war veteran with PTSD and an acquired brain injury was offered the following choices: undertake long-term and expensive treatment or euthanasia. How has the situation gone from 'we just want people to die with dignity' to 'maybe you should agree to be euthanased instead of paying all these nasty medical bills'? His conditions were serious but not considered terminal, and yet medical staff reportedly offered medically assisted dying as a money-saving option. I've heard from people concerned their loved ones could be convinced to end their lives by unscrupulous family members or spouses. So-called elder abuse isn't just limited to financial scams; it can manifest as physical harm and mental degradation, to the point that sufferers make major decisions that make no sense to their families. It is a great worry to people that greedy people will take advantage of sick, elderly relatives' fragile mental states to get them to agree to end their own lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A big part of improving medical care and treatment options is improving the Territory's economy, and one way to do this is to open up the vast gas reserves in the Beetaloo basin. A major reason for the Northern Territory's status as a nonstate is its reliance on Commonwealth funding to administer itself. Its population is small and extremely spread out, and many people live in the most remote part parts of Australia, which increases the cost to government to provide services. The obvious answer to the Northern Territory winning full statehood is for it to reduce its reliance on federal funding and to become more self-sufficient. The quickest way to do this, as I've said, is to unlock its vast gas and mineral deposits in areas such as the Beetaloo basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory Labor government is in financial dire straits. Its net debt as a percentage of GDP is the highest in the country, and, even with its impressive tourism offerings, a handful of operating mines, vast cattle stations and busy live export port, there are just not enough people and not enough money coming in. As long as the Northern Territory needs the federal government to pay the bills, the federal government will continue to have a say over its affairs. Meanwhile, right under its feet are some of Australia's largest deposits of oil and gas, namely in the Beetaloo and Georgina basins, worth billions of dollars. There is opposition to that from cattle producers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups, but, if a comprise can be found, the Territory could drastically improve its chances of self-determination as a state. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would call on this federal government to continue the momentum gained by the previous government to revitalise the Northern Australia Agenda. The Territory is in dire need of more people, more industry and more development, and it beggars belief that, while the Labor Party thought floods in Sydney and Brisbane deserved instant action, large parts of the Northern Territory are cut off during every wet season, leaving people isolated and without access to fresh food. The Territory cannot grow and cannot determine its own destiny without federal attention and real, practical help. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory is truly special to Australia. It deserves to be granted more autonomy, but we must be mindful of unintended consequences. Specifically, I would ask that, before there be any further consideration given to allowing for euthanasia to be granted in the Territory, the people of the Territory ask themselves: Do they have suitable alternative care? Do they have end-of-life provision for palliative care? And is this something that they would truly want to contemplate, or are we just exposing the most vulnerable parts of our community to another risk? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  A few weeks ago, on 23 August, Torres Strait Islander regional leaders came together on Masig Island to mark an important milestone, the 85th anniversary of the first ever Torres Strait Islander Council Conference. As a senator for Queensland, I feel lucky to serve such a culturally rich community. The Torres Strait is made up of hundreds of islands in the strait between Cape York and Papua New Guinea. There are 15 unique communities represented by the Torres Strait Regional Council, led by my friend, Mayor Phillemon Mosby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have spent a lot of time in the Torres Strait, this was my first time visiting Masig Island. Masig is a community of only 250 people. Its history is one of fishing, activism, religion, song and dance. Masig is represented by Councillor Hilda Mosby. Hilda has made the progress of her community her life's work. During the time I spent with her touring the island, she communicated the issues of her community through profound story and frank feedback. Hilda was hosting hundreds of visitors on Masig Island but took the time to take me to the quiet corners in need of repair and the proud monuments of her community's history. Like her peers on the regional council, Hilda is hands-on and extremely passionate about her community and region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Torres Strait Islands comprise 15 communities, each with their own custom, law, culture and, most importantly, delicacy. It takes real work, thoughtful leadership and generous compromise to build consensus amongst the islands, and that's exactly what was achieved on this historic occasion. The Masig conference drew a through line between the past of the Torres Strait, its present and its future. Community leaders shared insight from the very first council conference held on 23 August 1937. It would be remiss of me to not acknowledge this is a historical date for more than one reason. Not 30 years later, on 23 August 1956, Vincent Lingiari led the Gurindji strike, or the Wave Hill walk-off, on the exact same date in the calendar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward to 2022, and 23 August was the date of the Torres Strait Islander community leaders signing and reciting what they refer to as the Masig Statement, or the Voice from the Deep. The Masig Statement outlines a path to self-determination and regional autonomy for the Torres Strait. In my first few hours on the island, I heard Deputy Mayor Bani say, 'This is the beginning of a new beginning for the Torres Strait.' This refrain was repeated throughout the celebrations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of a looming referendum, a community striving for new beginnings feels full of promise. We spoke at length about what this statement means in the context of a voice to parliament. As my good friend Thomas Mayor said: 'On this occasion, this statement gives strength to the campaign for a voice to parliament. It complements the Uluru Statement rather than competes with it, because the statement is about a community clearly articulating their ambitions for their kids, their grandkids and future generations.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Torres Strait Islanders are a people renowned for their clever, patient campaigning. Through my time visiting the Torres Strait as a senator for Queensland I have observed that an important part of building consensus is sharing story. After years of spending time with community, I took the time during my address to share with elders where I had come from and how that translated into my strong commitment for collectivism and justice. I spoke about education and collectivism, learnt from the trade union movement, and reflected on the ways in which our histories interweave through shared activism and cooperation. I was grateful to deepen my knowledge of the history of the Torres Strait and the many ways it is communicated. It is hard to put into words just how much can be communicated with story, dance and song. Pages of beautiful words brought to life through movement and sound. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about Councillor Uncle John Abednego. Deep in the hot afternoon, just after a lunch of sandwiches and fruit, he stood up in front of a crowded room and, through his words and his story, invited the rest of the Torres Strait Islander leadership to culturally adopt me as their daughter and sister. I'm very honoured that they collectively said yes. I realise that this is symbolic in nature, but I was very deeply moved. I take this generous welcome in the spirit in which it was offered, with thoughtful consideration to how I can contribute to the community and profound respect for the history that I have been invited into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That contribution starts here today, using my voice to build awareness, consensus and enthusiasm, not only for the Masig Statement, but for a Voice to Parliament, that is so deeply needed to restore self-determination to the people of the Torres Strait. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the remaining time I want to read the Masig Statement into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> tonight, and I do so wearing this necklace that Phillemon Mosby was wearing when he read this Masig Statement for the first time in front of the crowd. He gifted it to me before I left the island. The statement says:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">To establish principles and parameters on behalf of the peoples of the Torres Strait and Northern Peninsula Area to act together in unity, in order to pursue and achieve self-determination and regional autonomy and, in so doing, preserve our distinctive and diverse spiritual, material and economic relationship with the lands, territories, waters, coastal seas and other resources with which we have connection under Ailan Kastom and Aboriginal tradition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">3. In keeping with Article 4 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in exercising our right to self-determination, we have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to our internal and local affairs, as well as ways and means for financing their autonomous functions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  As the clouds of war enveloped the world in 1939, a long-forgotten Irish truism was that democracy, freedom and liberty must always be defended and that Southern Ireland, as it was, should support Britain against Nazi Germany. Most of the Irish political class, shamefully, backed neutrality. James Dillon was an Irish nationalist of the old school. He and his family had for years, through democratic means, fought the British for Irish independence. Notwithstanding that historical hinterland, James understood that liberal democracies must always back other liberal democracies. While Australia and Israel do not have the historical dislike of Ireland and Britain, Australian support for Israel should be no less surprising, nor less forthright, than the words uttered by Mr Dillon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel is a beacon of liberal democracy in a sea of democratic darkness. Since 1948, Israel has long fought not just to exist as an independent state but to fight for the survival of all her people. Israel exists in a permanent state of war, not because it is an aggressor. But it is a victim: a victim of history, a victim of hatred, a victim of historical anti-Semitism. Yet, Israel is anything but a victim. Its citizens—all her people, Jewish, Christian, Orthodox, Druze, Muslim, nonbeliever—are free. It is the birthplace of innovation and the startup. It is turning its deserts into a food bowl. Most importantly, it is a democracy. It's a vibrant, boisterous, carnival of elections, so much so that, as I speak, Israel is undergoing its fifth election in three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of the enemies of Israel have ever held a free election. None of the enemies of Israel are free liberal democracies. None of the people of the Middle East have the freedom of all the people of Israel. To the north, the terrorist army Hezbollah has turned Lebanon and southern Syria into client states of Iran. Iran is an evil, despicable regime, intent on using nuclear weapons to destroy Israel and all Jewish peoples. While, to the south, the bloodthirsty terrorist group Hamas have turned Gaza into a giant launching pad for rockets into Israel. On the West Bank, the corrupt Palestinian Authority rules with Western donor financial support, yet it is a regime that uses the ugly politics of hate to remain in power. It is a regime that honours suicide bombers with both money and monuments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The miracle is not just that Israel has survived, but it has thrived. For that we in Australia are grateful, and we can only wish that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Israelis would be shared by all the peoples across the Middle East. Perhaps the haters of Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas should read the words that you read as you leave the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Remember only that I was innocent and, just like you, mortal on that day. I, too, had had a face marked by rage, by pity and joy, quite simply, a human face.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  This evening I rise to speak on Australia's processes regarding free trade agreements and the importance of Australia pushing for Indigenous inclusion chapters. Australia's free trade agreement processes lack any transparency or the ability for communities to actually comment on the potential impacts before they are agreed upon. Report 193 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties highlighted that civil society groups, unions, community members, traditional owners and environmental advocates are not provided with the same level of access to these negotiation processes as are business and industry. The report also stated that Australia's free trade agreement consultation process is inadequate and, indeed, very tokenistic. This is because corporations get a seat at the table over environmentalists, unionists, traditional owners and community members. These deals often benefit large corporations and compromise human rights, labour laws, cultural heritage and environmental protections. This process is so secretive we only see the agreement once it's been agreed to, so there's no scope for any actual amendments without serious concessions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims this secrecy is an issue of national security, which, frankly, is a bit of a cop out. I'm not convinced that this is the only option. In fact, we know it's not. New Zealand has a much broader and even more transparent consultation process that starts before negotiations even begin and actually continues until the free trade agreement is ratified. There are public consultation meetings and an opportunity for everyone to make a submission and participate in the parliamentary examination processes. Another feature of New Zealand's treaty negotiation process is dedicated Maori engagement to provide active partnership and respond to the range of needs, aspirations, rights and interests of Maori as a Crown treaty partner. Again, this is yet another reason why we need to be pushing for a First Nations federal treaty in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's treaty agreement framework falls short in transparency and accountability and in upholding human rights and environmental standards. This needs to change. The Australian Labor Party, when they were in opposition, and the Australian Greens argued that Australia's free trade agreement-making process should be better and more transparent. For years, the two major parties have written trade policy in favour of big corporations at the expense of community, workers, human rights, traditional owners and the environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another major flaw in this process is that this government and previous governments have not pushed for an Indigenous inclusion chapter in our free trade agreements. The Australia-United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement, which was signed last year in December, does not include a chapter on Indigenous trade, but in the recent trade agreement between New Zealand and the UK there is a chapter that contains provisions for cooperative activities to strengthen the trade relationship between the UK, New Zealand and Maori enterprises. The aim of this chapter is to help Maori enterprises maximise the opportunities that arise during a free trade agreement, alongside New Zealand and UK enterprises, and recognise the importance and value of Maori to New Zealand's economy and society. This means that the UK government is open to the inclusion of these chapters and, if they are pushed to include them, this government could do that. The previous government clearly did not care enough to push this, and it seems unlikely that the current government will actually care to try to do this and amend the agreements to provide the inclusion of such a chapter. The parliament has not cared enough to set up an inquiry into the potential benefits of Indigenous inclusion chapters, so we don't even know what we're missing out on, because we haven't even asked the question. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had our land stolen and our cultural heritage destroyed, and now there has been a recent rise in companies using native ingredients and First Nations botanicals and marketing them and themselves as First Nations companies. They are making huge profits, but the profits are not going back to the communities; these profits are sitting with a select few. Often they are run by whitefellas. They are stealing and capitalising on our knowledge. We need an Indigenous inclusion chapter that is going to place First Nations businesses at the heart of it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senato</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">r BILYK</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  On Monday last week I was pleased to attend the Australian government's building community forum in Hobart, followed later in the day by the Hobart Jobs and Skills Summit. I was joined at the jobs and skills summit by my colleague Senator Brown and the member for Lyons, Brian Mitchell. The Assistant Treasurer and Dr Andrew Leigh, the Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, attended both meetings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the previous government, the Albanese Labor government has been listening to and consulting with a broad range of stakeholders on the issues confronting Australians. The Hobart Jobs and Skills Summit was one of over 100 across Australia, including three in Tasmania, where local representatives of workers, businesses, training providers and other stakeholders fed in to the national summit in Canberra. Tasmanian summits have also been held in Launceston and Devonport. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hobart building community forum was the sixth across Australia to hear from Australian charities and not-for-profits about the challenges they are facing, as well as where they are finding success. It's refreshing to have a federal Labor government that is ready and willing to work with Australian charities, rather than trying to gag them, restrain them and bury them in red tape. This government is a friend of charities, and the decade-long Liberal war on charities is finally over. The 100 representatives at the forum came from charities of all sizes and across a range of causes, including religion; environment; education; health, including mental health; poverty; homelessness; disability; public interest journalism; and even animal rescue. Many had suffered through the pandemic, with donation revenue having fallen, and they had struggled to re-engage disengaged volunteers while demand for their services went through the roof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from charities that regulation or red tape was a big issue for them, as was funding certainty. While the previous government dragged its feet on fixing Australia's outdated charity fundraising laws—and you might remember that I worked with Dr Leigh on pressuring them to adopt the recommendations of the Senate inquiry I chaired to relieve charities of this $15-million-a-year red tape burden—I was pleased to hear Dr Leigh say that the government will be looking at reporting requirements for grants and will provide longer funding agreements so organisations can focus more of their resources on service delivery. We also heard from charities that they would like more support to engage and recognise volunteers and to achieve deductible gift recipient status.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank everyone who attended and contributed to the forum, and I thank Dr Leigh for his consistent work over many years consulting with and acting on the needs of charities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the same day, the jobs and skills round table, hosted by Dr Leigh, Mr Mitchell, Senator Brown and me, heard from more than 70 business, union, civil society and education leaders from across Tasmania. Among the feedback we heard were calls for incentives for businesses to host apprentices and the need to address the discrepancy between Tasmanian and mainland wages, a phenomenon known informally as the Tassie leisure tax. The lower average wages paid to Tasmanians provide an incentive for Tasmanian workers to leave for mainland jobs but they provide little incentive for in-demand workers to move to Tasmania. Attendees expressed fear over the risks the gig economy and labour hire currently pose to secure, safe and well-paying work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were strong expressions of disappointment over the previous government's gutting of vocational education and training, particularly TAFE, and there was broad agreement that TAFE needs to provide the skills that Tasmanians need in a changing economy. We also heard that there is a need to rethink how our education system delivers career education to young people. We were told that migrants need a simplified system for their overseas qualifications to be recognised in Australia. Sometimes skilled migrants are caught up in red tape, and this causes them to end up employed in a sector unrelated to their qualification. Also discussed was the need for housing and infrastructure supply close to where there is demand for work. All in all, it was a collegial and productive discussion, and the outcomes of the discussion, along with many others throughout the country, were fed into the national summit in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I'd like to thank all the participants for coming together for such a wideranging conversation, and I thank Dr Leigh for being there for both forums and facilitating the building community forum. These events show how the Albanese Labor government seek to listen to and consult with the Australian community. It shows that we will bring people together, not divide them. This is in stark contrast to the politics of division which were practised by those opposite when they were in government and which they continue to practise to this day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  We mark Vietnam Veterans' Day on 18 August, a solemn occasion on the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan that honours the service and sacrifice of the many thousands of Australians who fought in Vietnam. One of them was my father, who served with the 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. I was proud to observe the occasion by attending a wreath-laying ceremony at the RSL Wanneroo, near my electoral office in Perth's northern suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's commemorations also coincided with the 60th anniversary of the deployment of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. This was the first Australian contingent to set foot in South Vietnam and the last to leave. Today I wish to share some of their history and honour the service of this most highly decorated Australian unit, one of the most highly decorated units to serve in any conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unit first arrived on 3 August 1962, originally numbering 30 men, made up of a mixture of officers, sergeants and warrant officers under the command of Colonel FP 'Ted' Serong. It was informally known as 'the team', and 1,009 men served with the unit over its decade of operation, 998 of them Australians and 11 New Zealanders. The team provided training and leadership to South Vietnam forces, giving instruction in jungle warfare techniques and technical areas such as signals and engineering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For its first two years the team's personnel were deployed on operations as observers only, providing advisory support in the field without the authorisation to engage with the enemy. This was, unsurprisingly, impractical, as they were often caught in ambushes without the right to defend themselves. In 1964, these restrictions were lifted, thrusting the team into some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The first member to be killed in action was Warrant Officer Class II Kevin Conway, at the Battle of Nam Dong on 6 July 1964. Thirty-three men in the unit were eventually to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and another 122 were wounded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many in the team, service in Vietnam was an isolating experience. They often worked alone or in pairs in small advisory teams which served with Vietnamese units. Their dispersal meant Australia had a countrywide presence and, with it, the ability to assess the situation well beyond the borders of provinces in which most Australians served. The difficulty of their task formed part of their identity, with the unit motto being 'Persevere'. In the foreword to the book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Men who Persevered</span>, an account of the team's role in Vietnam, team veteran Major General John Hartley provided this description of their experience and their service:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A unique quality of the Team was its varied and frequently changing function. Certainly there was a training element, but members also led units, advised all manner of Vietnamese officers and officials, served on headquarters and determined policy. They were closely involved with regular and irregular forces, with Special Forces, Montagnards and Cambodians, with combat, combat support and service support units. At one time or another, they were deployed—individually or in small teams—to almost every province of South Viet Nam. Despite their small numbers, they remain the Australian face in the memories of many Americans and Vietnamese—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">who also served in that conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australian and American forces began to withdraw from Vietnam, the team's operations reverted to their original task of training, providing South Vietnamese forces with vital preparation. The last members of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam withdrew on 8 December 1972—the last Australians to leave the conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's appropriate to end this contribution by noting and recognising that four Victoria Crosses were awarded to the team's members, with numerous other awards and decorations conferred, including those conferred by the United States and the Republic of Vietnam. Tonight I acknowledge with great pride the service of all Australians who served in the Vietnam conflict. Your service is remembered, and today it's honoured.</span>
