Most of his assertions are incorrect and I think it is important that the situation be put clearly on the record. Approximately a month ago my daughter was taken ill late at night with acute appendicitis. It was diagnosed by a local general practitioner whom I called in. That GP then checked with a surgeon to conduct the operation at the Woden Valley Hospital. There was no interference with hospital authorities whatsoever. Simply, the GP discussed with me a surgeon to undertake this operation.

        So I simply exercised a right of choice that every Canberra resident has and, of course, which many residents in country towns have, if their doctors agree, and, of course, many doctors do. The one additional point I used insofar as I exercised this preference was simply to ensure that my daughter was treated by a fully salaried public doctor, that is, a person who is committed wholly and totally to the public hospital system and who is available regularly to Medicare only patients.

         —Obviously the tax cuts are a crucial part of the overall Government economic strategy. They will play, first, a very important part in stimulating consumer demand and in that way keeping the momentum of the recovery going. Of course, very importantly, secondly, the tax cuts will ensure continued income restraint under the accord and in that sense will underpin the accord which is recognised now universally-perhaps with one exception-as having been fundamental to the success of the recovery in this country. The tax cuts are, therefore, obviously good economics.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is important to understand that they are real tax cuts. The cost of the tax cuts in a full year will be $2.1 billion. Full tax indexation would have cost only $1.2 billion in a full year. So any claim that has been made in this spurious advertisement that these are not real tax cuts, of course, is just another part of the Opposition's mosaic of misrepresentation.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the last election campaign the Deputy Opposition Leader claimed that this Party would be a high tax government. The facts have shown that, of course, he was wrong during the campaign, and he will continue to be proved wrong. It is very important, let me say in answer to the honourable member's question, that we understand-and perhaps to some extent in some areas on the other side there is a glimmering of hope that they may understand it-that there is a need for reform of the Australian tax system. It needs to be reformed on the basis of considerations of efficiency and equity. I made it quite clear when I spoke in Sydney last week, and I repeat in this House, that when there is tax reform aggregate tax levels should not go up. They will not go up under this Government .
       </para>
       <para>
        I have referred to the place of the tax cuts in the economic strategy of this Government. It is appropriate, in the light of the honourable member's question, to ask ourselves: What of the Opposition's tax policy? It is a legitimate question. Although the Liberal Opposition talks about its tax policy by way of advertisements, it has not announced it yet. We do not know what the policy is.

       <para>
        I think if the Government is faced with a choice between giving a tax cut of, say, $1 billion and having a deficit that is one billion lower than it might otherwise be, I think it ought to choose the latter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those were the words of the shadow Treasurer. We all know, do we not, the dilemma of the Leader of the Opposition? Because of his irresponsible spending promises he has already developed a massive credibility gap in this area. To dissolve his dilemma of the $15 billion deficit that would be involved in his spending proposals, the only way out for him would be significant tax increases. When the mob opposite talks about taxes we do not have to think about what its tax policy for the future might be. All we have to do is look at what the Opposition did when it was in government. That Government was the greatest phoney of all time. What did it do? In 1977 it went to an election and said to the people: 'Here is your great tax cut'. When the Government got back into power what did the present shadow Treasurer do? The Government was not back a matter of weeks before it said 'Thanks. We gave you the tax cuts for the election. Bye bye, electorate', and grabbed the money back. That is the record of the former Government in the area of tax cuts. The Opposition has shown, in the area of economic management generally and fiscal policy in particular, that it simply cannot and will not be trusted. Against that, the record of this Government is clear. We have produced the tax cuts that were promised. They are real. If one wants to talk in advertising terms, the record shows simply this: Liberals talk; Labor delivers.

         —It is true that correspondence has taken place between the Government and Commissioner Costigan and between Commissioner Costigan and Mr Justice Stewart. Let me say this: The closedown of the Costigan Commission has not been rushed. I take honourable members back to February-March of this year when I spoke with Commissioner Costigan about the timetable for the closing down of the Costigan Commission and the transition from the Costigan Commission to the National Crime Authority. It was at the request of Commissioner Costigan that we met and it was with his approval that the timetable was set. That timetable was that his work would be completed by the end of June, when we set up the National Crime Authority, that he would require one month, the month of July, to see that the transition took place and a further eight weeks to see that his report was completed.

        As honourable members know, as a result of the legislation which has passed both Houses, the National Crime Authority is in place. The three people who form the National Crime Authority-Mr Justice Stewart as the Chairman, and Mr Dwyer and Mr Bingham as the commissioners-are now in place. There may have been some problems in the transitionary period, in moving from the Costigan Commission to the National Crime Authority. The material from the Costigan Commission has been handed over via the Attorney-General for the National Crime Authority to look at .
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not expect that we will face any grave problems in terms of the National Crime Authority being able to reach its conclusions about what references it will require from the first meeting of the intergovernmental committee, upon which the Commonwealth, of course, will play its part. As a result of the actions of this Government, I think that in future we will be in a far better position than previously to play our role in order to bring down the crime rate in Australia.

         —I thank the honourable member for her question. It is true that some curious calculations have been made. Indeed, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made another of his famous calculations just the other week. I quote from his speech to the National Press Club:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        My calculations are that staffing levels in the public service will rise by about 10 per cent under the Hawke Government's first two Budgets. This is a dramatically greater increase than occurred under the previous Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        He is way out in both respects. It is not the first time that I have had to give him a little assistance with his arithmetic, and I will happily do so again. The fact is that in the last year of the Fraser Government, in the last discredited Budget of the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the increase in the size of the Public Service was 5.3 per cent. As a consequence of that very large increase in that year there was a further increase, directly related to the decisions of our predecessors, of 2.2 per cent. Therefore, there was an increase directly attributable to the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition of 7.5 per cent in his last Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        By comparison, in our first two Budgets the increase has been 2.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent; that is, 4.6 per cent. Not only is the 4.6 per cent miles less than the 10 per cent that the calculations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would suggest; as well, it is miles less than his own tarnished record. But we are used to these kinds of calculations. I do not have to remind the House of his predictions about the size of the deficit in 1983-84 when he suggested that it would be $6 billion but when one of his heroes, the soon to retire head of the Treasury, told us that it would be $9.6 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that it is a bit more complicated even than that, because if we look at the way in which our predecessors handled the whole question of staff numbers we find that during their period of office the number of officers in the Second Division increased by a substantial 19 per cent, whilst the rest of the clerical work force increased by 12 per cent. The way in which they were able to offset that increase was to reduce by 50 per cent the numbers in the day labour force of the Department of Housing and Construction. The result was that, whilst this reduction limited the amount of funds that they spent on repairs and maintenance of government housing, it has left us with a most evil inheritance of houses which in many cases are almost uninhabitable. So as the result of some cosmetic treatment of the statistics not only were our predecessors unable properly to manage the size of the Public Service but also they were able effectively to damage the infrastructure which is required to house many of the people working for the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have adopted an entirely different approach. We do not use the crude approach of staff ceilings so beloved of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Rather we have used a process of proper personnel management and proper resources budgeting which has ensured that we have been able to contain the size of the Public Service but at the same time has ensured that there are adequate resources to provide the important services which are made available to the people of Australia. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that Sir Humphrey would have been pleased with this Budget. I think Sir Humphrey would have been very disappointed that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not able to undertake a simple arithmetic exercise without taking off his shoes and socks.

In terms of what briefings Mr Justice Stewart may or may not have received, I would think it very competent to lay it upon his shoulders to seek out what information he requires. He does have access to all the senior personnel from the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union at the same time as Mr Costigan is writing his final report. The problem I referred to earlier in reply to the Leader of the Opposition was that in some instances Commissioner Costigan in writing his final report may need some of the facilities and personnel to assist him that otherwise would be working with the National Crime Authority during this period. Of course, those services and facilities will transfer immediately to the Crime Authority once Commissioner Costigan has completed his work. We are not aware of any major barrier in this transition period. There may have been difficulties, but that is not a matter which has been raised with us by the National Crime Authority people.

        In terms of those working with the Commissioner, I noted the question the right honourable member asked about Mr Cummins QC. As I understand it he will be absent for one or two weeks between now and the end of the year, but basically the whole of his time will be given over to the National Crime Authority. In relation to the question the right honourable member asked about other staff, I know that Mr Justice Stewart was anxious to look at the make-up and levels of the staff that would be available to the National Crime Authority coming across from the Costigan Commission. When we set the budget for the National Crime Authority, while we gave it the same resources that the Costigan Commission had, it was on the basis that we would look favourably upon any further request that was made of us by the National Crime Authority. That was something which Mr Justice Stewart wanted to flush out, in his experience as head of the National Crime Authority, rather than having the Government prejudge what staff and at what levels he required for the Authority which he was going to run.

As we know, with the aging of the population that area is something which requires careful monitoring. That is the first thing that would happen if we abandoned the assets test. The second thing, which, of course, would not worry the people opposite but would nevertheless worry the overwhelming majority of Australian people, is that we would have a highly inequitable pension system. It would simply mean that very many very wealthy pensioners could so arrange their affairs that they would be able to get a full pension as against those who were significantly less well off but who, because of their position, would not get a full pension under the income test. That would be highly inequitable and something which, of course, would be welcomed by those opposite.

        Having made it quite clear in September 1981 that he was totally committed to the concept of testing so that pensions should not go to those who do not need them, he has now become an opportunist of the first order. Let me at least say this, because one always desperately looks for a bit of decency from the Opposition benches: I give credit to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because he has always made it clear that he supports the concept of an assets test.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by reminding the House that in September last year the Opposition promised to repeal the assets test as part of a total co-ordinated approach to retirement income policy. That was a year ago. We are still waiting for that co- ordinated retirement income policy. It is probably reasonable to come to the conclusion that we have not yet seen that policy because we had Mr Peacock, a private member as he was then, saying he supported the concept of an assets test ; we have the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, quite consistently saying that he supports the concept; and we have Senator Chaney saying that he supports it. As if it were not enough to have those who are currently within this Parliament challenging the Leader of the Opposition, we have outside the House Mr Elliott, a senior official of the Liberal Party, also supporting the concept of an assets test.

In terms of this year's allocation of funds, I can inform the honourable member that details of projects announced under the national component will be released today and an announcement of projects funded under the State component will occur in a week's time. The national soil conservation program is emerging as an effective package for conserving the land resource of this country. On coming to government, attempts to institute a national approach to dealing with the widespread land degradation afflicting rural Australia were hindered by the complete dismantling of soil conservation policy that had occurred under the previous Government.

        A national policy is being developed in consultation with the States. We have had two secondees from departments in New South Wales and Queensland and, as in all the Government's rural policies, there is an approach of consultation and quiet policy development that is gaining so much support in rural Australia. This approach is contrasted by the Opposition's confused approach to policy development. As we are aware, the Opposition recently brought out its primary industry policy, a wish list which would cost $312m extra. I see that there is to be another policy. I read from the latest edition of the National Farmer:
       </para>
       <para>
        Signs that the National Party is keen to develop a distinctive policy profile from its coalition partner, the Liberals, were given by Primary Industry spokesman Tom McVeigh, who said the party was preparing a separate farming policy from the coalition paper issued earlier to woo country voters.
       </para>
       <para>
        'Ours will be a lot better than theirs,' he said. 'It will be a lot more specific.'
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what the honourable member said. The problem is that he wrote theirs. I do not know whether the Liberal Party will come out with its own primary industry policy. After all, I think the Leader of the Opposition gave us seven sentences on rural industry in his reply to the Budget; so perhaps the Liberal Party has some interest in the primary industries. But how could the Liberals say his policy is better than theirs? What if there is a contradiction between these two policies? Will the Leader of the Opposition run with both policies in the time honoured coalition tradition of hypocrisy or will he put out his own policy? It is apparent that there will be two policies, and 'ours will be a lot better than theirs' according to the Opposition spokesman. What he is really saying is that his policy will be better than his. That is pretty confusing.

On those grounds I urge members of the Opposition to reconsider the policy declarations it has made in that area. I seek particularly to appeal to their better nature in view of the repression which has been taking place in the course of electoral processes in South Africa in recent times.

        First of all, the processes, which were presented as a constitutional advance, represent nothing more than a shabby manipulation of the electoral processes. The first and major deficiency is that more than 70 per cent of the population of South Africa, the black people, are completely excluded from any participation in the electoral processes.

       <para>
        In the course of the actual election processes the authorities, mainly the police forces of South Africa, were brutally repressive against Indians, coloureds and blacks, particularly against Indians and coloureds who were political activists but activists in a sense which we would recognise as a legitimate right in a country such as this.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a consequence of all this, the very widespread disenchantment and alienation of the non-white people of South Africa were reflected in the voting participation rates, less than 20 per cent for Indians and less than 30 per cent for coloureds. Without going into further detail there, I recall an article I read quite recently in the 10 September issue of the New Republic. I will give some quotes to illustrate the nature of the repression, of the cruel brutality, that takes place in South Africa. I do so, asking for the patience of honourable members and in the hope that, if the quotations are listened to, members of the Opposition might reconsider the statements they have made which have been described in the South African media as more accommodating of apartheid. The article states:

        Consider the following cases, which occurred during the last fifteen months: A white youth who battered a black man to death with karate sticks was ordered to serve 1,200 hours in prison on weekends. According to trial testimony, 20-year- old Ronnie Johannes Van Der Merwe was walking down the street with his girlfriend and bragged that he felt like killing a 'houtkop' (blockhead)-a derogatory term some Afrikaners apply to blacks. He brutally beat to death the next black man he encountered. The judge said Van Der Merwe could be partially excused for his actions because he was upset that his parents were considering a divorce.

        The A.W.B is a violent white supremacist organization, she said, with a swastika-like symbol and a salute modeled on that of the Nazis. But Justice Van Dyk had ruled that no useful purpose would be served by sending the defendants to jail since they are 'civilized and decent people'.

        South Africa is a powderkeg under present circumstances. There is an understandable bitterness on the part of the non-white population. Apartheid is a slur and a moral crime against the dignity and rights of a very large number of people. That country deserves to be repudiated. I urge the Opposition to reconsider the more accommodating commitment it has given to the policy of apartheid in South Africa.

         —The question that the honourable member for Leichhardt raises is an important one. When we came to government, ANL found itself in the position of being virtually bankrupt as a result of a policy instituted as far back as when the Leader of the National Party of Australia decided that ANL should perform its functions as an instrument of political policy. From that time ANL continued to go downhill. In simple terms the reason for ANL's withdrawal from the far north and north Queensland is that the revenue it gathers from that service barely covers the shore costs associated with it. The Australian National Line, like any prudent responsible business enterprise, is in the position of having to pay its way.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Given that it is battling to survive in these very difficult conditions, the Australian Shipping Commission has undertaken a service by service review of its operations to ascertain those services that have the prospect of paying their way and those services that have no prospect of even meeting the expenses involved. I have to say that ANL is losing in excess of $500,000 a month on its far north Queensland services. In total, since the service began in 1978, ANL has lost in real terms in excess of some $42m. As I said, the service continues to lose half a million dollars a month.
       </para>
       <para>
        The simple fact is that the people of the far north of Queensland have shown over the past six years that they much prefer the cheaper and more frequent road and rail services that are available. It was in those circumstances that I went to north Queensland last week at the invitation of the honourable member for Leichhardt, the honourable member for Herbert and Senator Reynolds to discuss the difficulty of ANL's decision with the people there. We discussed with business, community and union leaders in Townsville and Cairns the prospects facing ANL and the expenditures and revenues involved. Clearly, in Townsville the consensus was that the course being followed by ANL, considering all the circumstances, was the correct one. Similarly, in Cairns, it was understood that there was no way that ANL could continue to bear those losses and carry on.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have this continuing disarray in respect of what is the Opposition's policy. It seems to me that we have four different Opposition spokesmen on transport. We have the shadow Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Hume, who says that the line-meaning ANL-was justified in withdrawing its services to Cairns and Townsville if the service was unprofitable.

         —Then we have the honourable member for Dawson, the shadow Minister for northern development, or no development really for the north of Queensland. He sent me a telegram on 8 August, asking that I urgently intervene to require ANL to continue the service. One section, the old pork barrellers represented by the honourable member for Dawson, wants the service to continue regardless of the cost. Then we have the honourable member for Hume, the economic dry of the National Party, who says that we should not be in the business at all. Then the Leader of the Opposition got into the act. He went to Townsville and said: 'Well, if ANL cannot do it effectively it has to review its operations and perhaps bow out'. That is exactly what ANL is doing.

        But let us get back to the responsibility for the provision of intrastate transport services in Queensland. Again, that is a responsibility of the National Party in Queensland. National Party Ministers of the Queensland Government were invited to meetings which were called last week in Townsville and Cairns. True, the Queensland Parliament was meeting. However, neither of the Queensland Ministers involved saw those meetings as being important enough to attend.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were there. I was there to explain the position. But where was the National Party? One month after a decision was made on this matter, which is very important to the people of the far north of Queensland, the honourable member for Dawson has been stirred finally to raise the matter in this chamber by way of notice of motion. He could have raised the matter during the previous sitting week. He could have asked a question, as could the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Hume. Nobody did, because it is not a matter of accord or importance to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The responsibility for intrastate services in Queensland rests fairly and squarely with the Queensland Government, a National Party Government. If that Government wants that service to be provided it is up to it either to contract the service out to a company which will provide it or to contract the vessels from ANL. The Queensland Government can do what the Labor Government in Western Australia is doing. In Western Australia the Labor Government services the people of the far north of that State with its own shipping service. If the National Party is one iota fair dinkum-those who sit opposite and those in Queensland-it can provide the service.

Notwithstanding that we are well aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations is inquiring into the matter, the fact is that there have been no fewer than five inquiries in regard to this matter and the 300,000 people who are investing in the fund want to know what is going on.

He sought to relate that, as he has done in the past -I have said this sort of thing before-to the assets test. He knows, or ought to know, that an incomes test is different to an assets test. He has imposed not merely an incomes test on those aged over 70 but, in addition, an assets test. We have undertaken to remove the assets test because of its inequity. The incomes test will, of course, remain.

       (3) That it is with alarm the proposed censorship laws are regarded by citizens living in a society based on Christian ethics. In essence Australia is a Christian nation and our nation's laws must reflect and uphold our established values. Legislation which sanctions behaviour repugnant to Christians, is legislation not appropriate to Australia. Moreover, it is legislation which condones the destruction of the very fabric of our society. Legislation which promotes the degradation, abasement and exploitation of people, both young and old, and of our nation, is unacceptable.

      </para>
      <para>
       The humble petition of certain elected representatives and officers of local authorities in Australia shows considerable concern that the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program Levy, at 2 cents per litre of petrol and diesel, was indexed in the 1984 budget, but that funds raised from indexation of the levy will go into consolidated revenue, and not specifically into expenditure on road funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has been estimated that indexation of the levy will raise $491 million over the next six years to 1988-89, of which Local Government could have expected to receive $58 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is a further denial of funds to Local Government, following $13 million lost this year from Personal Income Tax Sharing entitlements.

         —Of all the broken promises and the phoney self-congratulations about being responsible for the fragile recovery, one sorry fact stands out. After 18 months, two Budgets and a mini- Budget, the average Australian is worse off today than when Labor came to office . Let me repeat that damning fact: Average Australians and their families are worse off now than they were 18 months ago. I shall seek leave to table details of the deterioration at the end of my comments. This Labor Government is engaged in a massive redistribution of income, aimed not at the wealthy but at moving income away from those average people who make up middle Australia.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course whenever the facts are laid on the table honourable members opposite, and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Keating), immediately resort to bluster and rhetoric. Take, for example, the Australian Labor Party's 31 per cent tax on lump sum superannuation. When questioned about the side effects of the Government's slug on super, the Treasurer invented the fiction that this tax would affect only a few privileged fat cats. The most recent example of this program of misinformation by the Government came when I presented figures calculated by the superannuation industry which showed that a person aged 45 entering a superannuation scheme today with a view to achieving a modest enough after tax lump sum benefit of a little over $150,000 at age 65-in 20 years time- would have to pay an extra $5 a week in contributions for the rest of his or her working life because of Labor's 31 per cent tax on lump sum superannuation. There goes most of the phoney tax cut right out of the window before we even look at the rest of the Labor tax machine.
       </para>
       <para>
        What did the Treasurer have to say about the facts on lump sum superannuation? He first made the ridiculous statement that these computations applied to people who would get $500,000 lump sum pay-outs-a blatant misrepresentation of what the coalition and the industry had said. He then went on to say that our figures were nonsense because 'only a minority of Australians are members of a superannuation scheme'. He might call it a minority, but let us just remember the size and the make-up of the minority that Labor has slugged. Two years ago there were 2.6 million Australians contributing to superannuation schemes. Of course the numbers have grown since 1982 and more are to come, with a further possible 430,000 from the construction industry alone. So while the Treasurer dismisses more than 2.6 million Australians as a minority, the fact is that Labor's super tax will hit hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the same with income taxation. I remind the House of what the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said. Of course he has scuttled out of the House to avoid hearing the truth about what he is doing to disadvantage ordinary people. On 16 February 1983 when he opened Labor's election campaign he said that there would be 'immediate reductions in income tax for almost six million Australian taxpayers with the greatest cuts going to those on the lowest incomes'.

         —Yes, 'immediate' was the critical word associated with the income tax cuts. He said that Labor would raise the tax threshold from $4,595 to $5,000 in order to 'free tens of thousands of low income earners from all tax'. He said that Labor would raise the dependent spouse rebate where there were dependent children from $1,030 a year to $1,134 in order to provide additional benefits to families. 'Families' is the word which the Prime Minister has not used since February 1983. It is just not in his vocabulary.

        Labor said also that it would raise the 46c tax threshold from $19,500 to $19, 750. Well, Labor's mini-Budget came and went with no tax promises in it. Of course Labor did hit those on superannuation and the over 70-year-olds with the means test. Labor's first Budget came and went with no tax promises in it at all . Of course it did hit the elderly, and it hit them again, with the assets test. Tens of thousands of low income earners paid tax for the first time. The real value of the dependent spouse rebate was allowed to erode and 400,000 workers, whom nobody would call wealthy, for the first time found almost half of every extra dollar they earned going to Canberra. As I said, following an interjection from the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), the Prime Minister has given new meaning to the word ' immediate'.

        In this Budget there is seemingly a new found urgency in the Government's attempt to live up to some of its tax promises before the early election, and so we have the so-called tax cuts brought down in the Treasurer's Budget. But what is the reality of these election sweeteners? Before taking account of the recent Budget changes, Labor had left average wage earners and their families $22 a week worse off in tax and family allowances. Then, up pops the Treasurer two weeks ago, having ripped off 22 bucks, saying he will give back $7.60. It is as phoney as the nonsense which the Prime Minister paraded in the Pacific on a nuclear free zone. We would have a nuclear free zone but with nuclear powered and nuclear armed vessels going around and around in it. We are to have a tax cut, but it will cost $15. Next week the Prime Minister will be in north Queensland making a speech on conservation. I will tell honourable members what he will do. He will chop down a tree, then mount the stump and make a speech in favour of conservation. That is the sort of nonsense that comes out of members of the Government. We have a tax cut-after the Government has taken $22 from people, they will get $7.60 back!

        According to the Treasurer's own definition, the minority of Australians will benefit. For many Australians the illusory tax cuts did not even make up for the extra tax dollar Labor is taking through fiscal drag. In the process, this Government has ensured that one million Australians-I repeat, one million Australians-will move into higher tax brackets during 1984-85.

The tax free threshold and the 46c threshold have not been changed and the Prime Minister has yet to honour his totally empty words of 16 February 1983. The real value of the dependent spouse rebate continues to decline.

        Ordinary Australians-a term not in the vocabulary of this Government and a group certainly not addressed by this Government unless it is to slug them-are picking up the bill for this Labor Government's big spending programs. Just the week before last the Treasurer released figures which show that a taxpayer on average ordinary time earnings, with a dependent spouse and two children, would have a lower real disposable income in December 1984 than he or she had two years earlier. That was revealed by the Treasurer's own figures. He comes in here and disputes my figures but has not been able to nail any of the component parts of those figures. He simply says they are wrong, brings in his own figures and releases them. They show that the people I have referred to will have a lower real disposable income than they had two years earlier, in December 1982. That is what the Treasurer showed.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has all this squeezing of ordinary wage earners achieved over Labor's 18 months in office? Of course the answer is nothing; we have gone backwards. In a year of windfall government receipts-receipts are up by $8.6 billion-this big spending, undisciplined, socialist Government has missed a one-off opportunity to restrain the growth in public debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Secretary to the Treasury, John Stone, said in his recent Shann lecture that failing to restrain the growth in the public debt serves only 'to defer further the day when meaningful reductions in taxation can be made and, above all, defer if not fundamentally impair the chances of lasting recovery in the longer run'. What a damning indictment of this Government's Budget and its big spending, big taxing economic strategy! Mr Stone knew what it was like, announced publicly his resignation days before the Budget and then poured it all over the Government days after the Budget. He is the Government's principal adviser to whom the Treasurer pledged so much faith and from whom he stated he had total support only the day before he announced his resignation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat: Government receipts are up a mammoth $8.6 billion. Yet the deficit, despite those receipts being up $8.6 billion, is down only $1.2 billion. Where has the money gone? We have been asking that question about the New South Wales Labor Party for a long while. The answer is that the Government has spent it like there is no tomorrow on its pet projects over the last two Budgets. Total government outlays rose nearly 8 per cent in 1983-84, followed by over 6 per cent in 1984-85-despite no increases in major Budget items such as family allowances. Let us remember that payments to the States fell in real terms. Real increases in spending by this Government in just two Budgets exceed the total for the previous six years of the coalition Government. The majority of Labor's spending increases were on Medicare and in paying the interest on the public debt. Every taxpayer now pays $17 a week just to service the interest on the public debt. Yet the actions of the Government in this Budget have locked Australians into a big Budget deficit next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        What has the spending splurge achieved? There is no fundamental tax reform. There is no reform of spending priorities. There is no restraint. There is of course hurt. We should ask the average person and the elderly, just for starters . There is the hurt. The bottom line of Labor's economic mismanagement is that the average wage earner with a dependent spouse and two children will have a lower real disposable income in December 1984 than in December 1982. The Government admits that during this financial year unemployment will remain unacceptably high. There is a massive public debt burden which Labor has increased. We have seen the lowest real increase in defence spending for six years and a reduction in the number of service personnel. All this has been achieved. There have been major cuts in scientific and industrial research and development and real cuts in grants for drug education, in Aboriginal housing and in coastal surveillance. The list goes on and on.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a time when the Government has $8.6 billion more than it anticipated the cuts and the hurt that extend throughout the community go into almost every area of governmental activity other than the areas where the socialists wish to get control of the direction and movement of people which is endemic to their philosophy. They have cut the areas which are essential to our security and to sustained recovery, but they have spent up big in other areas; and that is where the ordinary Australians' money is going. If the Treasurer comes back with more of his second-rate bluff and his second-rate rhetoric, recycles them and charges on to this train of misinformation, he will show that he is unable to cope with the facts. The facts show that he has no answer. I seek leave to table this document.

         —The time of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Peacock) never even arrived and it has now truly expired because he has never had the intellectual discipline or the intelligence to be able to put to the Australian Parliament and the Australian electorate a coherent view about the national economy, about taxation or about anything else. He has just been complimented by the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Hunt) on a good speech. All I can say about the Deputy Leader of the National Party is that his quality of observation has declined dramatically since the time he was a Minister and I can assure him and his colleagues that that will bring no more of them to this Parliament.

        Let me just make this point: The Leader of the Opposition has had only one domestic portfolio, industrial relations, from which he spat out the dummy very quickly. He then took his bat home, sat on the back bench and never at any stage tried to grapple with the national economy. In fact he left it to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to carry the can for a great shambles of a taxation policy, and carry the can he did when the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union exposed the massive tax avoidance which went on under his Government in those years. More importantly, he sat and watched the national economy fall apart in front of his eyes because of the tremendous fiscal imbalance over the last three years of his treasurership.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition talked about large spending and deficits. Where did the $9.6 billion come from? How did we get from a deficit of $1 billion two years ago to a deficit of $9.6 billion? I will tell the House how we got there. We got there because of the incompetence of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and his colleague the Leader of the Opposition who were Ministers in the Fraser Government. Of course, the mark of their incompetence was not just the extra quarter of a million people who had no jobs, the quarter of a million they pushed into the unemployment queues-they did not have to worry about tax cuts because they had no income-but also the other unfortunate people in Australia who were belted around with taxation and the dismal rates of growth over the period of their office. That is their contribution to Australia's economic performance. How dare the Leader of the Opposition talk about workers and families? He has never met a worker in his life. (Quorum formed) It is very interesting that the Opposition regards the matter it has raised as important but then calls a quorum during debate on it. In other words, the brain-damaged honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) made his first parliamentary contribution since being elected by calling a quorum to silence me for three minutes. For the Opposition to treat so frivolously a matter which it proposed for debate by calling a quorum shows that it must regard it very seriously and as a matter of great public moment!

        Madam Deputy Speaker, let me continue with the remarks I was making by indicating the total fallacy of the attack made by the Leader of the Opposition on the Government's taxation policy. It is worth observing the tax policies of the former Government. Let me give honourable members some of that Government's history. In the 1977 election campaign it promised a tax cut. Remember the ring up and find out how much your tax cut is, the fistful of dollars tax cut, election. Numbers in every capital city were given and people could ring up and find out how much their tax cut was. In May of the following year the Government took it away. It introduced an income tax surcharge to wipe the tax cuts out. Honestly, the cynicism of it would make a cat laugh. Here members of the Opposition are now talking about principles, equity and justice but they would not have a principle among them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Take the 1982 tax cut. The honourable member for Bennelong, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was the person who took the tax cut away. As Treasurer in 1978 he introduced the tax surcharge to wipe out the 1977 tax cut.

He was not the Treasurer, it was Sir Phillip Lynch who was in bed and who had been cut down by the former Prime Minister.

        The second issue was the tax cut of 1982-$2 billion with a $1.4 billion increase in indirect taxes. That is the tax performance of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-give $2 billion and in the same Budget take away $1.4 billion. The net cut was $600m.

       <para>
        Madam Deputy Speaker, take no notice of the Liberals on tax. They are rip-off merchants. The Liberal Government was the highest taxing government in Australian history. It let the tax system fall to pieces under the massive onslaught of tax avoidance schemes and was forced to do something about it only when Commissioner Costigan exposed it. That is its record on tax policy. The most important thing is that on this occasion the public have got a real tax cut of $7.60 a week, costing $2.1 billion in a full year which is almost twice as much as tax indexation. Tax indexation this year would have cost $1.2 billion in a full year, but we are giving $2.1 billion in a full year, almost twice as much as tax indexation. Even if we had indexed the scales it would have meant that somebody on a lower income would have got $2.30 a week. As it is, that person gets $7.60 a week as a result of the tax cut which this Government has given him .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition comes in here talking about $22 tax increases. We exposed that nonsense a week ago. The simple statistic about that is that if taxpayers were $22 a week worse off the Government would be $6 billion better off. Obviously we are not, so that indicates what nonsense such a claim is. Fancy the Opposition attacking our tax policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made it quite clear-he tries to wheedle out of it every Question Time -that given the choice between tax cuts or a lower deficit he would have taken the lower deficit. In other words, if he had been the Treasurer there would have been no tax cuts this year. Let us get that well and truly clear; there would have been no tax cuts under the Liberals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fancy coming in here and trying to make a case about living standards. Look at the living standards which prevail in this country at the moment: Job security, a quarter of a million people in extra work, 260,000 in fact; a public health insurance system for everybody, Medicare; the first home owners scheme which would never have been given to those 130,000 Australians who now have roofs over their heads; wage indexation which is worth $25 a week to the average income earner and which is opposed by the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy would have wiped it out; they would not have given this tax cut. That is another $7.60 a week. Of course they failed to mention the $5 to $6 a week saving in interest rates on home mortgages because this Government has got interest rates down from the record 20 per cent which we saw with the former Government when the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy were in charge. How can they get up in this Parliament and talk about living standards and the promises of this Government?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition even had the hide to say that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) promised a tax cut before the last election but he omitted to mention that we promised it believing that the deficit would be about $6 billion in 1983 -84 and found that it would be $9.6 billion. Because of the deceit of the former Government there was no possibility of giving tax cuts in 1983-84, and that is why this year the tax cuts were given when the economy started to improve and when the Government was able to get the deficit down.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition said that one million Australians have a higher marginal tax rate. Let me inform him that, as a result of this Budget, two and a quarter million Australians have a lower marginal tax rate and six million taxpayers-that is, all of them-have a tax cut. So if the Opposition wants to bandy any statistics around, they are the ones to focus on. It is no good saying that we never increased the spouse rebate. We assisted families by a $7.60 tax cut and we assisted those families not in employment. The Opposition says that we never spoke about families. What a mistruth that is. In this Budget a pensioner with three children and living in rented accommodation will be $15.50 a week better off. So we assisted those out of employment through the social security system, which the Opposition also opposed, and we assisted those in employment with a tax cut of $7.60 for most Australian taxpayers-particularly those in employment and with families. There was no adjustment to the spouse rebate, because we cannot give an increase in the spouse rebate at the same time as a $7.60 tax cut to a family while we increase pensions and benefits alike. It is just not possible to do all those things at any one time.
       </para>
       <para>
        We reject out of hand the phoney proposal raised by the Opposition on the question of taxation. It has no tax policy. Its policy was one of rip-offs, of protecting tax avoidance and evasion over the years. It was simply ripping people off through the massive inflation it had operating through the tax scales , with no adjustments. The only adjustment was in 1977, and that was taken back five months later with a tax surcharge. The Opposition does not have a leg to stand on. It is deluding itself if it thinks that some proposition here, written by some staffer in the office of the Leader of the Opposition, because he is incapable of delivering this sort of speech off the cuff, and full of mealy mouthed charges against the Government, will cut any ice whatsoever with any member of the public who sees a stronger economy, lower inflation, lower interest rates, more job security, more employment, higher wages and a public health insurance system. Is that a contrast to the years of misery under the Liberals, of mounting unemployment, high inflation, high interest rates and no security for anybody? Everyone's job was threatened in their days.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's proposal is simply a joke. The Government rejects it out of hand for the sham which it is. When the test comes, as indeed it always does, for any political party to face up to the public and say 'This is what we did, this is why we did it and this is how successful it has been', I know the judgment will come in very strongly on the part of the Government. This Government inherited an Australian economy in a shambles and in the deepest recession since the Great Depression. In coming out of it we have given not only those increases in living standards which I mentioned but also a substantial tax cut of $7.60 a week, costing over $2 billion in a full year, and at the same time we brought the Budget deficit down from the $9.6 billion left to us by the honourable member for Bennelong to $6.7 billion, $3 billion lower, despite the fact that we are wearing the massive cost of those unemployment beneficiaries who were lumped on to the Budget by his policies when unemployment galloped in this country. When we look at the burden of public debt interest, which we carried because of the failure of the former Government's policies and high unemployment, to reduce the deficit by $3 billion in two years and to give tax cuts are indicators of a good performance on the Government's part.

        It said that the whole of Australia would get a tax cut, that there would be no wine tax, that there would be increases in the public sector and that there would be increases in terms of security for families through Medicare.

        The Treasurer in Opposition was a sparkling performer. There is no doubt about that. But since he has become Treasurer of the nation he has been increasingly less receptive to economic argument. In fact, very seldom at Question Time does he come to the point on economic questions. He relies substantially on rhetoric. I really do wonder at the Treasurer's claim that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Peacock) would make a cat laugh.

         —I think that probably points to what I was just saying, that he does not have much regard for economics at all and that he is much stronger on rhetoric than on anything else. As for making a cat laugh, we should think of the President of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales and the poor old cat. Wran's cat got lost. I wonder what it swallowed. There is a lot of corruption down there so I guess something happened to it as it disappeared out the window. The response from the Treasurer was totally one of rhetoric. The realities are that the Budget was drawn up as a straightforward exercise in squaring off business. On the one hand, big business had to be squared off. What did we do for it? We resurrected the old chain companies so that expenditure incurred in a totally unrelated field could be written off against current income expenditure. That squared that lot off. What did we do for government? Big government was squared off by a vast increase in the amount of revenue dug up from the Australian taxpayers. Not satisfied with that, we added to it a substantial deficit so that we could carry on a wide-sweeping government spending program. That is what we did for big government. What did we do for big unions? We met their demands by giving them a tax cut. They do not seem to quite understand the difference between taking $22 out and giving $7 back. They cannot be much good at business. I am not surprised that the Australian Council of Trade Unions' efforts in business have failed if that is its level of understanding. However, the trinity of bigness was all squared away.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What occurred in this particular area? If we look at the Budget Papers we find that this vast increase in government revenue is to be achieved partly by way of personal contributions from citizens. In fact, 53 per cent of all government moneys raised this year will come by way of personal income tax. The amount has vastly increased from 51 per cent in two years. This is an area in which the Government is saying that it is taking less. However, the figures show quite dramatically that that is not the case. On top of that, all of the Government's revenue estimates are based on the supposition that the economy is strong, that the balance of payments will continue at its current level and that international trade will continue to recover.
       </para>
       <para>
        At Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that the cut in personal taxation will do an enormous amount of good for the economy, particularly in the area of consumer demand. The Confederation of Australian Industry issued a paper on 3 September which contained an analysis of the level of consumer demand on a quarterly basis. The paper shows a growth in consumer demand of 2 per cent in September 1983; 1.1 per cent in December 1983; 0.3 per cent in March 1984; and 0.2 per cent in June 1984. One would be concerned on that basis alone that the income projections within the Budget will be met, given the tax cuts that are involved and the ability of the Government in the framework of the Budget to deliver anything in the coming year. Therefore, those who are charged with the responsibility of framing the next Budget certainly will be left with very little to build on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the question of spending. In this area we see not only the vast increase to which the Leader of the Opposition referred but also the components within it. We will certainly not escape from this area. A lot has been made by the Treasurer about the deficits that were left to him. But what do the figures show? In 1980-81 the deficit was $1.1 billion; in 1981-82 it was $500m; in 1982- 83 it was $4.4 billion. Now we see the real truth of the matter. In 1983-84 the deficit was $7.9 billion. The projection for 1984-85-I say 'projection' because there are many doubts in respect of this matter-is $6.7 billion. When exactly did this huge growth take place in the Government deficit? It has come in the last three years. I return now to the percentage outlaid in spending in terms of funding the debt. It is interesting to note that 8.8 per cent of total outlays is now going in funding the Government deficit.

So the debt is more than expenditure on education. It is just short of the expenditure on defence of 9.1 per cent. We are looking at a total social security payment of 28.8 per cent and that is the sort of figure the Government will be getting towards if the deficits are not brought under control.

       <para>
        This Budget was framed in a totally opportunist approach to electioneering, without any regard to the national interest or the future decade economic management of this country. The Government has let the opportunity pass at a time in which it claims that the economy is in good shape, at a time when it could have managed to restrain Government spending without an impact on the economy. When the Government looks back, especially in 1985-86 and 1986-87 when the projections of economic activity are substantially less than they are today, it will not be in a position to rectify some of the huge structural problems that are built into this Budget and with which no effort has been made to come to grips.

        I think the citizens of Australia ought to be aware of the increasing concern that most of us have about this situation. Just to underscore that, something like 25 per cent to 28 per cent of gross domestic product today is underwritten by government securities on the market. A frightening amount is taken up in funding that area. If deficits continue to grow in this way-we can look forward to a deficit of substantially the same size or even greater in the next Budget- they will increase the proportion of GDP in the public sector. This certainly underscores once again the proposition that this Budget does absolutely nothing for individual incentive, private enterprise or the ability of Australians to improve their own lot within the economic system. I think that this Budget has done enormous harm to the citizens of Australia, to the families of Australia and to private enterprise.

         —This is an absurd matter of public importance to bring forward in this Parliament at this time. It has done nothing but waste the time of the Parliament. It is clear that some of the Opposition's own back benchers even think that because they called quorums on the Opposition's own matter of public importance. To hear the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) in the speech that he has just made-it was the second of two poor speeches on this matter from the Opposition-talk about the cat of the Premier of New South Wales and other such matters just adds insult to injury. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) claimed that this Government had reduced living standards. This absurd matter of public importance has been built around that false and phoney claim, because that claim is nothing more than arrant nonsense. It is symptomatic indeed of what the Liberals and their National Party colleagues are peddling around the country at present. It can be summed up as peddling the specious in place of the solid, the plausible in place of the truth.

       <para>
        I bring to the attention of the House how the Opposition's analysis-for want of a better word-from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is just so selective and distorted. They peddle figures that living standards have been reduced by $22 a week. First of all, they choose to include in their figures the abolition of the highly inequitable, ineffective and regressive mortgage interest rebates, but they choose to exclude the replacement of rebates with what is now the better targeted and highly effective first home owners scheme grant. The grant has gone up to $7,000 over five years, which represents an average payment of $44.87 a week. Members of the Opposition ignore all of that. Further they ignore the savings of all home buyers. I am using some illustrations from my own portfolio area of housing and construction. In these phoney assessments and analyses of theirs they ignore the savings of all home buyers as housing interest rates fall. Repayments on a typical $30,000 savings bank housing loan are down by no less than by $22 a month. They ignore that fact in their phoney figures. The situation is very different now from what it was when they were in office. Interest rates have gone down virtually three percentage points from what they were when this country was presided over by the Fraser Government. In other words, the Fraser Government would have taken $55 a month from the pockets of typical housing loan borrowers in this country by way of increased interest rates. I repeat that the Opposition's claims about living standards are phoney.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me illustrate why this is so. The Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy have overlooked altogether what has gone into the social wage due to the policies of the Hawke Labor Government. In what they have put forward they have overlooked the provision of $623m for the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in the 1984-85 financial year. An amount of $623m will be provided from the Commonwealth Parliament. The figure is up 9 per cent on that for 1983-84. The figure for 1983-84 was 50 per cent higher than the figure for the 1982-83 financial year when a mere pitiful $264m was appropriated through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for public housing in this country. I do not think that many members of this Parliament would have thought that even this Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy could produce analyses that are just so phoney, so wrong, so slipshod, so loose, so puerile and so lacking in grasp as those that have been produced by the present Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy. In summary, their mediocrity is superb.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been a member of this Parliament for a while. You will know that an assessment of a Budget is best gained in one's own electorate office. One is able to gauge, from the phone calls which one receives, how the Budget has been received. I might say that as a member of this Parliament for 15 years I have never known the people of my electorate to be more satisfied with a Budget than they are with this Budget.

         —The honourable member's memory about that is as good as his memory and knowledge about the living standards of people in this country. He has just made that up as he made up the figures which stated that living standards have reduced by $22 a week. I have already put that matter in its proper place. We are entitled to ask: What would these carping critics have done? What would these moaners and groaners be up to if, God forbid, the country was being run by them? It is fair to say that they would want a deficit of at least $1.5 billion less than the deficit that we have been running. It is also fair to say-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was honest enough to say so-that that reduced deficit would have been created by not giving the tax cuts that this Government has given to the people of Australia. The tax cuts amount to $2.1 billion in a full year and $1.3 billion in this year. The average taxpayer will have $7.60 a week more in his pocket.

        What would the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy have done with the economy of this country? Instead of having created 270,000 jobs, as the Hawke Labor Government has done since 1983, they would have run lower deficits. They would have cut the civil and defence works programs of this country. They would have ensured that those 270,000 and more would have been unemployed. The history of the last year of office of the Fraser Government, which was administered by people such as the present Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy, shows that 270,000 jobs were lost in that year. It is fair to say that the former Government would have continued with those policies. There would not have been the great growth in the economy and the great result in improved living standards which have come with the growth that we have had under the Hawke Labor Government. It is also fair to say that under the former Government there would have been a continuing protection of the tax evaders of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the House and the people, when we are talking about an attack on taxpayers, as do the terms of this phoney matter of public importance, of what these people in the Opposition have done in relation to our attack on the tax evaders of this country. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition remains the friend of the tax evaders. The only growth industry while the Opposition was in government was the tax evasion industry. Now the present Opposition continues to protect the tax evaders. Members of the Opposition have refused to pass bottom of the harbour taxation legislation on three occasions. Twice they have refused to pass the cherry-pickers legislation. We will give them another opportunity shortly to allow that legislation to pass. They have refused to pass the income equalisation deposits legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of all this, the ordinary honest taxpayer in this country has to bear an increased burden. Revenue worth $285m has been lost because the present Opposition has had to protect its Liberal tax dodging mates. Yet the Opposition has introduced this absurd matter of public importance about the Government attacking taxpayers. Members of the Opposition are the attackers of taxpayers. We are seeking to help the taxpayers by what we have done and what we hope to do in attacking the tax evaders. We have been prevented from doing so by the actions of members of the Opposition. What the taxpayers want and what we all want is a continuation of that growth which the Hawke Labor Government has already initiated. That means more people in jobs. We want those extra people in jobs not only for social reasons but also, of course, because when they receive an income they contribute to taxation and thus reduce the burden on other taxpayers of this country.

Therefore, they come up with these sorts of things. I extend personal thanks to the Leader of the Opposition, who is at the table, for raising this subject today. We were worried that the Budget had been forgotten. He has helped us to remind the people of how good it is.

         —I thank the House. In a foreword to the report of the Australian delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings in 1983, at Helsinki and Seoul, I expressed views, as Leader of the delegation, on the necessity to provide continuing support for the Union and its achievements. In April this year I had the privilege and pleasure of leading the Australian delegation to the first of the conferences to be held under the reorganised procedure adopted in 1983. The procedures now provide for two six-day conferences each year, in April and September, at each of which two study committees meet, with provision for a third committee to meet on any supplementary item agreed to by the Conference under its amended rules.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In accordance with the new procedures, the seventy-first Conference was held in Geneva from 1 to 7 April, organised and paid for by the Union's Secretariat. The venue for the Conference, and again for the next Conference in Geneva in September, reflects problems currently facing the Union. Despite the decisions reached in Seoul in 1983, which were at least partially directed at easing the pressures of size and cost, no offers to hold the April Conference were received . The Secretariat of the Union subsequently agreed to hold the Conference on a limited budget and on the understanding, consistent with the decisions in Seoul, that certain previously customary features would not apply or would apply to a lesser extent. Being a member of the Executive, I can say that it took quite some time to sort out precisely what the procedures would be. The lack of offers from member countries to act as host to coming conferences continued at Geneva, where none was received for either September 1984 or April 1985, and the only longer term offer relates to the September 1985 Conference, which will be held in Ottawa, at the invitation of the Canadian group.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to the problems of cost and availability of facilities, which understandably restrict the capacity of many members to hold conferences, a political problem arises when national groups find it impossible to adhere to a fundamental rule of the Union that host groups must issue invitations to all member groups to attend conferences-I do not want to canvass that issue, for obvious reasons-a rule which the Australian group has always strongly supported, and I trust will continue to do so. The current state of international affairs, particularly with respect to the participation of certain member groups, is regrettably such that there exists a further restriction on the number of potential host countries. These problems are of considerable concern to the Union and its Executive Committee is giving close consideration to them. For member groups such as Australia it is important that they be overcome and that the Union should continue to provide the opportunity for legislative members of the over 100 national groups to meet and discuss subjects of national and international importance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I acknowledge and express the delegation's thanks-that is, on behalf of all members-for the co-operation and work of the many people involved in running the Conference, but particularly the Secretariat of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which had to accept the considerably greater than normal work load of organising the Conference, with extremely limited resources. The thanks of all delegates are due to the Secretary-General, Mr Terenzio, and all his staff members, who made the Conference the success it undoubtedly was. I express the Australian delegation's very sincere appreciation of the generous and significant assistance provided by the Australian Ambassador at the permanent mission to the office of the United Nations in Geneva, Mr David Sadleir, and to the Australian Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr Richard Butler, who is also based in Geneva. Both were generous in extending briefings and hospitality to the delegation. David Sadleir, who as we all know, had previously had significant experience as a former Foreign Affairs officer attached to Inter-Parliamentary Union delegations , provided the highest possible level of assistance to the delegation, including the attachment to the delegation of a First Secretary, Mr Noel Campbell. I warmly express the delegation's thanks for all their help and also for that extended to members of the delegation by the Australian Ambassador to Switzerland, Mr Pierre Hutton.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by expressing my very sincere thanks and appreciation for the wonderful support that I received at this Conference in particular from my deputy, Senator John Watson, but also from the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann), the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman), the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and also my very good friend Senator Peter Cook . I thank the House.

         —by leave-I will not recapitulate what the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) has said, except to say that I thoroughly endorse the comments that he has made and express the same appreciation. I express appreciation also to this Parliament for the opportunity of being a delegate to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference. We express our appreciation to the honourable member for Hawker for his leadership and for the manner in which he tried to involve all of the delegates. We very much appreciated his experience and also that of his deputy, Senator Watson. Those of us who were fortunate enough to have our wives with us also give thanks for the courtesies that the leaders showed to them. I believe the members of the delegation worked together. There was a conscious effort by all members of the delegation to work in accord and I think that that was achieved. It was a happy delegation.

        I mention only one concern and one disappointment. Of course, this is no reflection on our delegation or its leaders. I admire Mr Cumming Thom and our officers, who have to queue for many hours to try to get speakers on the lists at these conferences. It seems that there is no effective organisation. Despite the fact that they queued for hours, there seemed to be queue jumping and real problems. It is disappointing that if many speakers are on a list we have either to drop a speaker or to curtail the contribution that delegates who speak are able to make. As I say, it is not the fault of any of our leaders. It seems to be a problem of organisation. I hope that it is a problem that can be resolved, although I know that it will not be easy because there are so many countries that send delegates, and we welcome them. The more countries that send delegates , the more effective are such conferences. So many countries send delegates and all of those delegates, of course, want to make their contribution, so it is not an easy problem to solve. I do not know the solution but it seems to be a problem of organisation, and I hope we can solve it. Once again, I express my appreciation to the Parliament for the opportunity to attend the Conference and to those who led us at that Conference, and I pay tribute to their excellent leadership.

When speaking in Geneva on the topic of the contribution of parliaments to the success of current and future negotiations leading to the cessation of the arms race, arms control and world disarmament, aimed at ensuring peace, I was critical of the IPU. Amongst other things, I said:

        Most of the parliaments represented here are not representative parliaments. They are representatives of one party and often of one person or of a small clique. I believe the threat to peace comes from the non-democratic nations, not because their citizens want war but because they have no say.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later on I gave some examples and mentioned the war between Iraq and Iran. The current dispute on the siting of the intermediate range missiles in Europe was to me an excellent example of what I was discussing. I said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We have detailed and to some extent rational discussion in the United States and the Western European countries, but where is the discussion in the Eastern Bloc? We know that the Americans, the British, the Dutch and the West Germans are divided on the issue, but surely there would be divisions of opinion amongst the Russians, East Germans, Czechs, etc., if they were allowed to discuss the siting of the SS20's.

        What a farce this organisation is when the 10 million Poles who joined the free Solidarity trade union have nobody in their parliament or at the I.P.U. What a farce that all those Czechs who supported Dubcek and Socialism with a human face are excluded. What a farce that Chile is excluded whilst Vietnam is accepted as having anything resembling a parliament. Neither should be here.

       <para>
        I criticised the IPU secretariat which in order to get more contributions ignored the absence of democracy and representativeness of most of the affiliated countries. I more or less concluded by saying that I felt that war and aggression went hand in hand with dictatorial regimes because only they can start them without having to justify them to their people. I continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us forget all the hypocrisy of right and left. Are religious dictatorships like Iran preferable to para-military dictatorships such as Iraq or vice versa? Let those of us who do represent fairly open and pluralist societies emphasise that there is a relationship between aggressive war, a closed society and the absence of democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since making that speech, I have received a letter from Mr Pio-Carlo Terenzio, who is the Secretary-General of the IPU. He commented on my allegations relating to the unparliamentary nature of many of the affiliated countries. I feel it is only fair, since the letter arrived too late for its inclusion in the report of the Australian delegation, to seek leave for the letter to be tabled.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If we take Parliaments for which candidates, having various political affiliations, run separately for elections . . . then the figure is 53 out of 102 member Parliaments of IPU.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point he is making is that the majority of parliaments-53 out of 102 member parliaments-do have elections. I think this is fair enough. My view would be that the other 49 should have no entitlement whatever to be represented at something called an Inter-Parliamentary Union. There is some doubt in my mind as to whether we could really find 53 member countries of that organisation which have opposition parties and parliaments whose members are chosen in democratic competitive elections through which a government can be voted in and out. It is important for us to remember that.
       </para>
       <para>
        If other people in the organisation feel the same way, it may be appropriate for Australia to try to encourage an IPU which, rather than going for an imitation of the United Nations, should try to concentrate, because it is a different sort of organisation, on having parliaments represented at its meetings, parliaments by implication being bodies which send to the IPU members who are speaking not necessarily for their governments but for themselves or the political parties they represent. Such parliaments should have a number of opposing points of view represented. This is a matter that I have raised before. I do not think it means that we should disaffiliate from the IPU but if something worthwhile is to come from a meeting of parliamentarians it would be much more appropriate to have a meeting of people whom all of us would consider to be parliamentarians, in other words people who have to defend their points of view and who can be attacked by those who hold different points of view in our country. I thank the House for allowing me the time to present my point of view.

         —I rise to state the coalition's firm opposition to this Government's two referenda proposals, the Constitution Alteration (Terms of Senators Bill) 1984 entitled 'A Bill for An Act to change the terms of senators so that they are no longer of fixed duration and to provide that Senate elections and House of Representatives elections are always held on the same day', and the Constitution Alteration (Interchange of Powers) Bill 1984 entitled 'A Bill for An Act to enable the Commonwealth and the States voluntarily to refer powers to each other'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I propose to dwell on the first of these referenda proposals in more detail as its consequences have far-reaching significance for the future of Government in this nation. Once again, it is the coalition's task to strip away the blatantly hypocritical mask of this Government. For what the referendum on simultaneous elections is really about is nothing more than a fraud on the Australian people. It is aimed at undermining the role of the Senate, and strengthening that of the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government seeks to convince the Australian people that it is improving the Constitution, that it is remedying an oversight, some minor technical defect relating to joint elections for the two Houses. That is the Australian Labor Party confidence trick. The reality is that at the moment senators have a fixed term of six years which can be brought to an end only when pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution, a double dissolution is granted for the House of Representatives and the whole Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The founding fathers did not give the Prime Minister or the Executive the power to dissolve half the Senate at will. They did not do this deliberately. The successful passage of this referendum would effectively give the Prime Minister just this power. The Government says that this is unimportant, that it is an improvement in electoral arrangements, but that is not what this proposed referendum is really about. What Labor is plotting is the undermining of the independence of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is part of a long term Labor strategy, a long held Labor goal, of doing away with the Upper House altogether as well as State governments. The Attorney- General (Senator Gareth Evans) said before coming to office:
       </para>
       <para>
        The way to abolish the Senate, or at least to muzzle it, is to white-ant it from within.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was reported in the Canberra Times of 2 July 1978. That is what the first of these Bills is all about. We are talking about not technical modifications, but radical change to our governmental system. We are talking about upsetting a carefully crafted system of checks and balances on the authoritarian tendencies of government. This proposal in effect is about increasing the power of a power hungry Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        It helps to expose the hypocrisy and the cynical intentions of this Government to look at the brief history of its proposed changes to the Constitution since coming to office. In May 1983 the Attorney-General introduced a package of referenda proposals into the Senate. The package had at its core a proposal for fixed term parliaments. It also included proposals for the interchange of powers , advisory opinions, and removal of what the Attorney was wont to describe as outmoded provisions of the Constitution. The coalition directed its attention primarily to the proposal for fixed term parliaments. This we opposed in fairly strong terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to other measures in the package, although we were sceptical as to their virtues, we did not, in fact, oppose them. Then, having introduced this package of changes, the Labor Government, in what is becoming a typically cynical fashion, concluded that if the referendum on fixed terms was passed it would compromise its ability to call an early election. As we all know, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) would not want to do that despite all his promises in February 1983. The Government belatedly realised that its proposed change would have required it to see out almost its full term of office.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the first opportunity for an election being in November 1985, under its fixed term proposal, the Prime Minister, having fallen under the influence of the shady elements of the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party, did not even have the integrity to admit that he was abandoning the fixed term proposal. Instead, he announced that the referendum to be held in August 1983 was to be postponed. Following that decision, or more aptly non-decision, the Government announced that it would proceed with the referenda containing proposals for a four-year parliamentary term and simultaneous elections for both Houses of Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition was attracted to these proposals as a package. We indicated our interest in the package. We thought the proposal for a four-year parliamentary term was an important one which would give stability to government in Australia. As there could well have been public objections to the Senate having a fixed eight-year term, we thought the proposal for simultaneous elections for both Houses was a satisfactory way of modifying the possible effect of an eight-year term for senators. The Government then proposed that the referenda on these matters be held in February 1984. We were going to vote on them in February 1984 . Of course, if that referendum on four-year terms had passed, it would have avoided the need for an election for half of the Senate by 30 June 1985. Certainly, it would have avoided any need for the consideration of an early election for the House of Representatives. Once again, the devious mind of the Prime Minister and his shady advisers from the New South Wales Right woke up to the reality that their devious plans would be upset. So the minders from New South Wales examined the matter and its consequences and woke up to the fact that their excuse for an early election would be eliminated if they pursued this proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite this, the Attorney-General, always slow to understand the political intrigues in his own Party, was still boring the Senate with the virtues of the watered down February proposals. At the end of last year the Government was anxiously searching for some excuse to abandon its second attempt-it had not even been governing for 12 months-at a referenda package. As was to be expected with this Government, political self-interest was winning out again. The Government then proposed to the Parliament the spending of $2.5m of taxpayers' money on the Yes case for the February referenda-no money for the No case, but $ 2.5m for the Yes case. It knew that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats- the latter on this issue, at least-would take a principled stand and oppose this grotesque misuse of taxpayers' money. When, as anticipated, this proposal to squander taxpayers' money was defeated, it provided the deviant occupant of the Prime Ministership at the moment with the excuse that he was desperately seeking and searching for to abandon the February referenda and the limitations they may have imposed on his ability as Prime Minister to call an early election.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has now produced its third referenda package, the most cynical of the three. In fact, it bears little, if any, relation to what was originally proposed. It is a proposal for so-called simultaneous elections. To try to give it some hint of respectability, the Government adds to it the proposal for the interchange of powers. As the Opposition has previously stated, although we recognise the strong arguments against simultaneous election proposals, we nevertheless believe that when coupled with a measure to include the stability of government in this country, such as the four-year term, we could perhaps support it. Our support was always predicated on increasing the stability of government. We are not prepared to support a simultaneous elections proposal on its own, for this is an ugly and cynical attempt by the Prime Minister to extend his powers and those of the Executive by removing one of the checks in the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has witnessed in a short period this Government's deceitful and expedient approach to constitutional reform. It amounts to an attempt to remake the Constitution in a way to benefit the Labor Party electorally and to remake the Parliament according to the Labor Party's authoritarian preconceptions. A question that must also be addressed is why this Government is putting these referenda proposals to the Australian people at the same time as a general election. The answer to me is quite clear and obvious. The ordinary Australian in 1974 and again in 1977 rejected this proposal for simultaneous elections. The Government is hoping that by burying the referenda issues within the general election campaign they will go unchallenged and largely unnoticed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government is hoping to sneak them past the Australian public. Well, the average Australia will not fall for that confidence trick. People are already very tired of the shabby tricks of the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party and I am sure we shall hear more of them as we come to receive Mr Costigan 's report. They are waking up to the fact that the Prime Minister having thrown in his lot with this grouping-the crooks from New South Wales-is fast losing his last vestiges of fabricated integrity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government said that it would give the people plenty of opportunity to assess alternatives for constitutional reform. The Prime Minister is reported in the Western Australian Press as opposing the joining referenda proposals with an election, as it could make things too complicated. The Government's argument for an early election is that it wants to put the elections for both Houses back into synchronisation. However, if it put through these referenda proposals on their own, at an early date, it would run the risk of losing what little justification it has for an early election. The whole history of this Government 's approach to constitutional reform reveals that there is no intention, no goal , other than to keep its options open for an early election while increasing the power of the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me look briefly at the arguments the Government uses in support of the Bill to give the Prime Minister the power to call a half Senate election at his will. The Government argues that by eliminating separate half Senate elections the number of elections will be reduced. The House should need no reminding that we will soon have the thirty-fourth House of Representatives election and it will be the twenty-eighth simultaneous election of the two Houses-28 out of 34. Since Federation, there have been very few single House elections-six in the House of Representatives and only four separate elections for the Senate. To say that there is a problem about simultaneous elections under the existing Constitution is to perpetrate a great hoax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where is the problem? It is very simple to have simultaneous elections. The Prime Minister can have a simultaneous election as late as May next year, as the Opposition has suggested to him. If by some mischance, he was re-elected, he could then run a full term of three years and have another simultaneous election in late 1987 or early 1988. Let me make this very clear; there is no problem at all about conducting simultaneous elections under the present Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government argues that the passage of this referendum proposal will eliminate half Senate elections being held independent of a lower House election , and therefore eliminate so-called unnecessary elections. Again, what is the problem? Since Federation there have only been four such half Senate elections. The average Federal term in Australia is about 2.4 years. This will not be changed by this Bill. Indeed, elections may be more frequent under these proposals as it would make it easier for governments to hold early elections.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also claims that its proposal will ensure that the composition of the Senate reflects the current wishes of the people. It is stating the obvious that there will be an election for half the Senate every three years. By comparative international standards this is a short term and the Senate will always be reflective of popular opinion in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lastly, the Government says that it will provide greater accountability of the Senate to the extent that senators will have to face the people if the senators' actions lead to a premature House of Representatives election. We have here an important point. But what the Government really means by this argument is that whenever the Prime Minister wants to have an early election he should be able to use the Senate as justification for doing so and going early. This is a very different matter altogether. This is what the simultaneous elections issue is all about. As Malcolm Mackerras the very well-known political commentator stated in a national radio broadcast on 1 February 1984 about this proposal:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of so-called simultaneous elections my view is that it is quite the most dishonest proposal ever put to the Australian people; the public case in its favour is a series of lies, and it has already been twice rejected, in 1974 and 1977.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not the purpose of that proposal to give the Australian people the benefit of joint elections for the two Houses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Its purpose is to give more power to the Prime Minister and to weaken the independence of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        These quotations were from Notes on the News, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 1 February 1984. It is absolutely crucial to the integrity of the legislature and its role in the democratic system that it have some separation from the manipulative powers of a Prime Minister. This is why the founding fathers gave to the States House-the Senate-a fixed term. It is part of those checks and balances which are so important as barriers to the concentration of powers in the hands of one man or his party. The Senate fulfils a vital role as a House of review. The Coalition fully supports that role as set out in the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make it clear, this proposal is not about simultaneous or less frequent elections. This is a misleading and deceptive argument. It is an attempt to impinge upon the legitimate role of the Senate by giving the Prime Minister greater powers with which to threaten and cajole it into submission. It is the first stage of a concerted attack on the constitutional independence of the Senate and the thin end of the wedge of denying the legitimate role of the Senate in representing the States. The Australian people have had the good sense to reject these proposals twice. I am fully confident that they will reject them again and deny the Prime Minister the power to dissolve the House of Representatives and half the Senate at any time and without Parliamentary reason .
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I turn my attention to the proposal for the interchange of powers. This proposal is going before the Australian people in an attempt to give an element of respectability to the Government's other referendum proposal. There are provisions in the Constitution for the reference of powers to the States by the Commonwealth. Possibly these could be improved and there may be some merit in this proposal. But in reality what this is about is to enable the Commonwealth Government to give the States the power to impose excise duties on their people. Labor supports the exchange of powers so that the States can impose indirect taxes on their population. I believe that people should be made aware of the implications of this proposal. The States currently have the right to refer powers under the Constitution as it exists. That they do not do so has less to do with any difficulties about referring those powers than it has to do with their natural reluctance to relinquish powers.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will oppose this particular referendum proposal because it is camouflage for the dishonest proposal to undermine the independence of the Senate, and because it is only for the benefit of Labor politicians who seek to change the Constitution without consulting the people.

         —At the outset there are a couple of observations we should make about the Opposition with respect to matters of constitutional amendment and constitutional propriety. First, the Opposition's record on constitutional propriety does not ring very well in the Australian political scene and the electorate knows that well. The electorate that had to go through the experiences of 1974 and 1975 would well remember that the Opposition's record in terms of being the people designed to protect the Constitution is a pretty shoddy one. Really, if we cut through all the verbiage we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), we see that the conservative parties have been portrayed as constitutional hit men when it suits them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second observation I would make about the Opposition in this context is that it really is clear in terms of the history of Australian politics that the conservative parties have always painted themselves as the great defenders of propriety and the Constitution until it happens that that propriety or that Constitution does not suit them. Then they very quickly break the rules. We saw it in 1974 and 1975. We see it when we are asked to refer matters in Australia to the constitutional umpires in the case of Mr Justice Cross.
       </para>
       <para>
        We found very quickly that the Opposition was not prepared to accept the umpire 's decision in the case of Mr Justice Cross. We found very clearly that in 1974 and 1975 the Opposition was prepared to use the Constitution for its own ends rather than be the great protector of the Constitution. So the people listening to this debate have to understand that members of the Opposition cannot come into this place and be the defenders of constitutional propriety, because their record is too dirty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been cynical with regard to these constitutional matters. Those of us who remember 1982 will recall the situation concerning the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. When we were to have an election depended on whether his back would give out, whether his mind would give out or whether his political will would give out. So it is just not good enough for the Opposition to ask us to forget that two years ago we were on again-off again in regard to an election. So members of the Opposition cannot paint that picture because the electorate remembers what happened. The electorate remembers also that as defenders of constitutional propriety the Opposition's record is very bad indeed. It should not try on the arguments it puts forward because the community will not accept them and neither will we.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first of these pieces of legislation which will lead to a referendum will do a couple of things. First of all, it will reduce the total number of elections. The record shows that the Australian community does not particularly welcome having to go to the polls all the time. In fact, the experience is that we now have a very untidy system. It is a system that was made more untidy as a result of the premature election in 1983. This Bill is designed to bring together the terms of the Senate and the House of Representatives so that every time there is a House of Representatives election half the Senate will go to that election. That is very important because it means a great saving of money. I am sure that the people in the community will understand that. Let us look at what separate half Senate elections cost. The Opposition has ignored this point in the debate. At present, a separate half Senate election costs approximately $ 21.8m and a separate House election costs $23m. Thus, the total cost of separate elections for the two Houses is now $44.8m. It is a very expensive process. Considering the low esteem in which the Australian community holds politicians- it believes that politicians are generally very expensive people-it is difficult to justify spending that type of money. This proposal would reduce the incidence of elections. If simultaneous elections are held the total cost reduces from $44 .8m to $27m. As a consequence of this measure we would be saving taxpayers' money. That is the first comment I wish to make. It will mean a saving of something like $17.8m.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The extra point to make about the referendum proposal in this Bill is that we are also trying to bring the Australian electorate into a position whereby it can vote simultaneously on the House of Representatives and the Senate. At the moment the complexion of both chambers can be quite out of key in terms of the mood of the electorate but even more seriously we have the possibility of the Senate behaving in that irresponsible fashion in which it behaved in 1975, causing the House of Representatives to go to the polls with no risk to the Senate itself. I know it suits those people opposite, those people of great constitutional propriety, but that is a very strange system to try to defend in a democracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other observation to make in the context of this debate is that it has been very difficult to establish just where the Opposition stands. These proposals have arisen out of constitutional conventions. There has been support for them at constitutional conventions but the present Opposition parties opposed the simultaneous elections proposal in 1974, put it forward in government in 1977, vacillated but supported it in Parliament in 1983, and now they return to their opposition of 1974. Where do these people of great constitutional propriety stand?

Not only can they not make up their minds but also, as I said earlier, the whole history of Australian politics shows that the conservative parties see themselves as political hit men in Australian politics. They want to use the system to suit themselves and not try to design a system which contains anything about fairness or anything about reducing the cost to the taxpayers. They are two things that we are trying to establish with this legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Another issue I want to develop concerns the interchange of powers amendment. This was addressed by the Leader of the Opposition. The interchange of powers amendment, in a nutshell, is designed to enable both Commonwealth and State governments to interchange powers where it would make sense for those powers to be shared in a different way. What are two examples of where it would be sensible for the Commonwealth and the States to have an interchange of powers? One clear example that comes to mind is in the area of conciliation and arbitration. At the moment we have a dual system. It is expensive and its coverage is not complete. I take just one instance within the system of conciliation and arbitration, and that is the role of industrial inspectorates. At the moment we have enormous confusion about the roles of industrial inspectorates. We need to combine the roles of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the respective State commissions so that those inspectorates can work together to police awards. That would be a sensible way to behave. We believe that it should happen and that it has great implications in terms of industrial relations. It is something that this measure would make more possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other area is insurance. I refer particularly to workers compensation insurance. There could not be an area of greater burden for the community at the moment, particularly small business, than the absolutely astronomical cost of workers compensation. We want to work towards a single system of workers compensation throughout Australia that would reduce administrative costs. It would certainly go a long way towards eliminating the great cost burden borne by business at the moment. This interchange of powers arrangement would make it far more possible for us to get towards a single system of workers compensation. It would be a sensible system and one that would result in a reduction of costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have chosen two examples of where an interchange of powers would make sense. I have given the example of the conciliation and arbitration area where Federal and State commissions could work together in areas of joint operation. That would certainly simplify some of the current procedures. The second area concerned workers compensation where clearly a great burden is being borne by the community. It is a burden that causes many small businesses to be at great risk. This would simplify that situation and we would be able to get towards a single workers compensation system throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me quickly go over what I have said as time for this debate is limited. In the first of these constitutional amendments we are trying to limit the number of elections in Australia in a sensible way. We do not seek to remove the chance of voters having a say, but seek to eliminate the enormous number of elections we have had. The figures are quite damaging. In the 39 years since the end of the Second World War there have been no fewer than 20 Federal elections of one kind or another-seven combined House of Representatives and half Senate elections, five House of Representatives elections, four separate half Senate elections and four double dissolutions. When we start talking about double dissolutions those opposite should feel uncomfortable. In the last 20 years the pace has increased. We have had 11 elections. Only two were combined, and we have had three House of Representatives elections, three half Senate elections and three double dissolutions. So we are now having a situation in which we have an enormous number of elections. This first proposal is designed to tie together Senate and House of Representatives elections.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second thing we are trying to do is reduce the cost burden. The cost burden on taxpayers is enormous. Why should we continue to impose those sorts of burdens on the electorate? I wish members of the Opposition, as the people of constitutional propriety, could make up their minds clearly over a long period where they stand. Clearly they have some difficulty with that because they are looking for opportunities to score political points rather than to make some sensible constitutional amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the second proposal, the interchange of powers proposal, our intention clearly is to arrange a sensible situation in which the Commonwealth and State governments can interchange powers. I have referred to two areas-conciliation and arbitration and workers compensation-which I believe to be sensible.
       </para>
       <para>
        To sum up, these Bills leading to referenda are about making the machinery of government more sensible. If there is one thing towards which we in this place ought to work if we are to get the respect of people in the community, it is government having some common sense to it, and these proposals are based on common sense ideas about the way Australia should be governed. I am pleased to support these Bills.

         —I commence by taking up some of the points made by the last speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). He spoke of verbiage from the Opposition. Has he looked at the reasons put forward by the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) in the Senate? I am sure he has not. I will take him to them. He then spoke of a constitutional umpire and, if I heard him correctly, referred to Mr Justice Cross. Mr Justice Cross was running an inquiry in that racket-infested State from which I must say I come, New South Wales, under the auspices of the New South Wales Government. How he can possibly say that he was a constitutional umpire and portray any understanding of the Constitution is something that I simply cannot understand. Then he cried crocodile tears about costs of elections. The costs are coming from this Labor Government, which has added to the size of the House of Representatives and the Senate and thereby greatly increased the cost of government and the cost of running elections. It is as though democracy can be measured in dollars.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What real weight does the Government place upon these issues? We heard a 30- second speech from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) representing the Attorney-General in this place and on the speakers list we see that speakers for the Government are to be the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) and the honourable member for Stirling, from whom we have just heard. The babies are being sent in to bat. They are big babies, but babies they certainly are. Not one member of the Government's front bench is to deal with what are meant to be two serious constitutional issues. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), who has spoken, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair), who will be speaking, demonstrate by being here that we regard these matters as important, just as the absence of any Ministers from the other side demonstrates the view that the Government has of these issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition in addressing this House referred to some of the history of the proposals now before the House. It is worth while taking one or two minutes on the history. The House will recall that on 24 November 1983 the Attorney-General referred to referendum proposals which were to be put forward and issued a public statement on the subject. There were five proposals: Simultaneous elections, parliamentary terms-a four-year term-interchange of powers, the advisory jurisdiction of the High Court of Australia and the removal of outmoded and expended provisions. We know what happened. We know that this package was scheduled for February 1984, so it was said. We know that there was objection by the Australian Democrats and by the Opposition in the Senate to the Government's putting forward a one-sided case only. It was proper objection because if the people of Australia are to make decisions on referenda proposals they should have both cases put before them. Nevertheless, that was taken by the Government as a cop-out, as an excuse for not proceeding.
       </para>
       <para>
        Next we see that two proposals are to be put to the people of Australia. These are described by the Attorney-General in the statement of 11 June 1984 as the most important of the five which were to be put to referendum last February. Has he forgotten the four-year term and is that not indicative of what Mr Mackerras has called the tissue of lies which the Government has used to advance its case in relation to the so-called simultaneous elections proposals?
       </para>
       <para>
        If one goes to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did not say and to what the Attorney-General has said, one sees that the Government destroys its own case by what it says; and this is where we come to the Government's verbiage. Let us start with the Attorney-General. He said in the debate in the Senate that a package was to be put to the electors in February. He then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        As you will no doubt recall, the Government decided not to proceed with the referendums in February because of the action taken in the Senate by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to block government advertising in support of the proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Was that really the only reason? Is he running away from important constitutional changes simply because he is not able to get the funding for one case only? Does anybody really accept that the Government is putting the case truthfully to the Australian people? Then what did he say? He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        To put all five of the original machinery of government proposals in conjunction with an election would have been too complex.
       </para>
       <para>
        Oh, really? Why can they not be put separately? They can be. He then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is vital that electors have a proper understanding of the issues involved in a referendum so that they can cast informed votes and thereby play a meaningful role in constitutional reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        Oh, really? That came from an Attorney-General and a government who were going to put one case only to the electors. Is that how they inform the electors? Do the electors make a meaningful and informed decision by not being given both cases? Referring to the fact that he really wants to have the electorate informed on these subjects, he then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why the Government is only proceeding with two of the proposals at this time.
       </para>
       <para>
        What arrant and demonstrable nonsense! But that is not all. We have been given by the Attorney-General a statement of the Government's reasons why it is going forward with the so-called simultaneous election provisions. I remind those who would put forward the argument that the two Houses are out of synchronisation that it is perfectly competent for this Government, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, to call an election at any time before 30 June and to put the House and the Senate back into synchronisation. But that is not to be done. I also remind the House that, if these proposals go forward, by force of section 128 of the Constitution they must be put to the Australian people, once they have passed both Houses, in not less than two nor more than six months from their passage. If they go through the House today, 4 November is the first date on which an election can be held and these proposals put and 4 March is the last date. In short, the Government has deliberately limited its own options so that it can go to the Australian people with a perfectly specious argument at a later stage and say: 'We are bringing this election forward because amongst other reasons we want you to consider these very important constitutional proposals'. Does anybody think that in an election, when the issues are concentrated upon the future of this country, upon economic matters and upon matters of great moment, the average elector will give a damn about constitutional proposals and the arguments about constitutional proposals? Of course he will not.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me go on to examine the reasons which were given by the Attorney-General in the Senate but which were not repeated here by the Deputy Prime Minister. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister is a man of somewhat tender sensibilities and I can well understand his flinching from repeating what the Attorney-General said in the Senate. Let us look at some of the reasons given by the Attorney-General. In dealing with the question of simultaneous elections he spoke of the number of elections. That matter has already been dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition. Then he went on to talk about money. We know how acutely conscious Labor governments are of spending money. It gets down to weighing democracy in dollars and cents.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a disgusting basis on which to put forward an argument that we should alter the Constitution and have fewer elections. Why? Because it will save a few dollars. Next the Attorney-General went on to say that the fact is:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . that the elections which are being eliminated are the unnecessary separate half Senate elections, which cannot change governments and which, as is indicated by their much lower level of voter turnout, do not really come to grips with the issues of the day.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course they cannot change governments but they can and do change the composition of the Senate and the Senate can and does influence, alter, amend or reject Bills put up by this House. It is spurious nonsense to say that for that reason they are in some way unimportant. What was his next reason? He went on to say this about the simultaneous elections proposal:
       </para>
       <para>
        It will ensure that the composition of the Senate at any given time reflects the current wishes of the people more accurately than under the present system and, by ensuring that the people's will is reflected simultaneously in both Houses, it will provide a more satisfactory electoral basis upon which the government of the country can proceed.

        Translated that means that he hopes to have an upper House which is more responsive to the wishes of the Executive in the lower House. Is that in the long term interests of this country? Is that in accordance with the views of the Constitution which we have held for so many years? Does that support a system of review? Does that support a system of checks and balances? No, it does not, but it most certainly supports the power of the Prime Minister and the power of the lower House at the expense of the Senate. The Attorney-General went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It will also provide greater accountability of the Senate to the extent that Senators themselves will have to face the people if the Senate's actions lead to a premature House of Representatives election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once more, let me give honourable members a translation. That means that he hopes by this means to place the Prime Minister of the day in a position where he can put a gun at the head of the Senate and say: 'Unless you give me the answer that I propose to get I will force an election'. My view is that it is a very wise thing that we have a House of review and that we should not do anything which would in any way erode the strength of that House because it is central to our system. We do not have here, as in other countries, a democracy which is effectively a dictatorship of the lower House, nor should we ever have that kind of situation in this country. He then said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        A small minority of Honourable Senators opposite have suggested that the Bill is really aimed at undermining the independence of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is that not Senator Evans's long term goal? Is that not the goal he has proposed for many years? Is that not the view which is espoused by members of this Government and is that not absolutely and in all ways consistent with the platform of the Australian Labor Party as adopted at the last conference? I will come to that platform in one or two minutes. Senator Evans went on to give the game away, so to speak, in a throwaway line in his second reading speech in the Senate. When referring to the Senate he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it will retain, for better or worse, all its present power to review, amend or reject legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the power which has been in the Constitution since Federation and the power which most people believe should be there because most people do not believe that there should be unfettered power in the House of Representatives. What we are now seeing is a step down the road to securing the aims of the Australian Labor Party as espoused in its conference. It is a pity that Senator Evans is not here. We on this side of the House understand that he is making some moves to transmit himself from the Senate down to the House. I would be delighted to see him here. I understand from some New South Wales members of the power-broking fraternity on the Government side of the House that his chances of getting down here are slim. It is a shame but one can understand his reasons for wanting to do so because a person who has such a complete contempt for the Senate would not wish to stay there for very much longer, certainly for any longer than he could. Let me now come to the Australian Labor Party's conference and its constitutional and legal platform. We have a photograph of the Attorney- General, who is looking his best, and next to that we see the heading ' Constitutional Reform'. Let me quote items 4, 5 and 6. Item 4 states:

       <para>
        The Minister at the table interjected, and correctly so, 'House of Lords'. The House of Lords is an hereditary system which I am glad to say we do not have in this country. It has a power to defer, but it has no other powers. Those powers were rightly-because it is a non-representative House-taken away from it many years ago. But what would be the consequence of a Senate which had power only to defer something for six months and no more? It would become an empty and sterile debating chamber and all effective political power would vest in this House, which means that all effective political power would vest in the Executive of the day and the Prime Minister of the day. There would be no checks, no curbs, no balancing of that power. That is the aim which the Australian Labor Party espouses and that is the underlying principle behind the proposal to alter the terms of senators.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have referred to the importance of the House of review. I also refer to the Prime Minister's view of the Senate, expressed in the language which is characteristic of him-temperate, balanced and, one might even say, modest! I am reading from a quotation of him by Senator Robert Hill in the Senate which came from the Age of 16 December. The Prime Minister was quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        I've had enough of this recalcitrant Senate blocking the will of the Government . I am not going to be in a situation . . . where we are dictated to as the democratically elected Government by the mish-mash of opposing forces in this country. If they think they can determine the pattern of the Government . . . they have another think coming.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is most certainly a correct reflection of the views of the Prime Minister, this Government and the Australian Labor Party. It is not a correct reflection of the views of the people of this country. I remind honourable members of some of the things which could not be done had we got rid of the powers of the Senate in the way which has been suggested. For example, we could not have reviewed assets test legislation. We could not have rejected proposed laws which were called tax avoidance or tax dodging laws, which is the usual way of describing any laws that one wants to pass in the field of tax but which in fact have the effect of catching many innocent people. I suppose that consistent with this cutting away of the powers of the Senate it probably should not have committees. Committees can, after all, be most embarrassing to governments. They can investigate matters such as the Age tapes and allegations against Ministers. We all know that on both sides of the Houses. What do committees do? They act as a brake on the authority of the Executive.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have no apologies on behalf of the Opposition in speaking against what is proposed. It is a step towards Labor's stated objective. That objective is, as I have said, to reduce the Senate to an empty and sterile debating in chamber. It is no wonder that Senator Evans wishes to desert that chamber for what he would think would be a happier clime. One would not, after all, want to cut the power from underneath one before one got out of the chamber in which one was going to exercise the power. The Leader of the Opposition has said that these proposals are a fraud on the people, and so they are. If they are to be seriously put forward to the people they could be put forward as separate questions and not in the middle of a general election so that the people could carefully consider and weigh the issues. But that is not being done and the political reasons for what is being done are just too obvious.

         —Tonight we are considering two minor referenda proposals which are proposed to be put to the people. I was extremely disappointed by the contribution of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) who talked about a racket infested State, which, after all, does give him a living as the people in one electorate in that State send him to Parliament for better or worse. He was obviously not in the Liberal Party when illegal casinos flourished in Sydney. I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament from 1973 to 1976. Illegal casinos in Sydney flourished under the Liberal-Country Party Government of that time. Starting price betting flourished. It was an absolute disgrace that rackets were allowed to flourish. The honourable member for North Sydney has the hide to talk about New South Wales being a racket infested State.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am proud to represent a constituency in Sydney which I think is the most beautiful city in Australia. I know that the people in my electorate are delighted to live in such a cultured city. I really feel that the honourable member for North Sydney should apologise to the citizens of Sydney for attacking that delightful city by calling it racket infested. He totally ignores the history of the corruption that went on in New South Wales for many years under Liberal-Country Party governments. It is a credit to Premier Wran that he closed the illegal casinos.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is obvious that the Liberal Party has perceived in these referenda the possibility that the Australian people may vote to agree with the referenda and that somehow or other it may not benefit if the Constitution is changed. The Liberal Party does not believe in fairness. It believes that unless some situation favours the Liberal and National parties it should not be introduced into the Constitution. I do not really believe that the Liberal and National parties believe in democracy. They want checks and balances, when the Australian Labor Party controls both Houses. They want a complicated system. Yet, they know that the Senate was merely a rubber stamp when they were in government and controlled both Houses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for North Sydney talked about the Labor Party's platform. I, together with the Minister for Aviation (Mr Beazley), agree that there should be no blocking of money Bills by the Senate. I agree with the Labor Party's constitutional platform. But we are not debating the Labor Party platform in regard to constitutional matters and the people of Australia will not be voting on that. It is proposed that they vote on a referendum to make sure that elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives are held at the one time. Such an arrangement will save an enormous amount of money and reference has been made to those amounts this afternoon. It is also proposed that they vote to enable the transfer of powers between the State governments and the Federal Government and vice versa.
       </para>
       <para>
        Every Australian remembers the appalling constitutional crisis that took place in 1975. It was the worst constitutional crisis that I have ever known. We remember the backlash against the then Governor-General. No one wants to see that situation repeated. I believe that the Liberal and National parties want a re-run of that frightening crisis and want our nation to be brought to the brink of anarchy. They really do not want the Australian people to have a say in referenda on what should happen in these minor matters such as holding elections at the same time.
       </para>
       <para>
        We went through a period in the 1970s when election followed election, when the Liberal Party did everything possible to encourage candidates to stand for election to the Senate. Appalling allegations were made that the Liberal Party did this to make ballot papers inordinately difficult for infirm people and people without much English and ability to write a lot of numbers or to fill out a complicated ballot. It manipulated the system in an atrocious way as other speakers on our side have mentioned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation is of some significance because at present the term of office of a senator is six years. The proposal is that in future a senator will be elected for two terms of the House of Representatives, whatever period that is. Some countries, such as the United States of America and Costa Rica, have fixed dates for elections. However, the Australian people have always given some flexibility to the Prime Minister of the day in the setting of elections. In 1977, of course, Malcolm Fraser brought the election a year ahead of schedule because he wanted to have simultaneous elections, and the people agreed with that proposal. Then, in 1983 he did something that I could not really believe he would do; he put the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives out of kilter. The referendum which is the subject of this legislation will ask the Australian people to ensure that elections must be held for both Houses at the same time. I note that a half Senate election costs $17.8m. I feel that the Australian people will not support such an appalling waste of money.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was also disappointed with the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Peacock) who also attacked New South Wales. Apparently, any State that has the courage to return a Labor government is in for vilification in this House from the Liberal-National Party. The Leader of the Opposition also had the hide to mention the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Costigan report. If ever there was a report that embarrassed and threw the Liberal-National Party out of government, it was the Costigan report and the revelations about bottom of the harbour tax schemes. That report totally destroyed the credibility of the Liberal-National Party to collect taxes fairly. The Australian people will never forget that the Liberal- National Party allowed the allegations in relation to bottom of the harbour schemes to drag on for eight years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wanted to mention my good friend Mr Malcolm Mackerras whom I have known for many years. I appreciate that Malcolm is opposed to this proposal. I noted in the Sydney Morning Herald that he was able to crank up and drag the Liberal Party in behind him to support his ideas. But 1983 is in all of our memories. That was a cynical exercise in which the Prime Minister of the day called an election a year ahead of time. The poor honourable member for Flinders at the time was not even sworn in. He was elected in December 1982 and he was not even sworn in before we went to the polls. That was a cynical exercise by the Liberal -National Party of the day. This referendum, if the Australian people agree, will stop similar cynical exercises. We are putting this to the Australian people. There are too many elections. The people are browned off with elections. I believe that too many elections are a threat to democracy because people get fed up with compulsory voting. Particularly in the 1970s, many complaints were received by all members of Parliament and the media. People appreciate that elections are expensive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Without wishing to delay the House this afternoon I call upon honourable members to support the proposal in these referenda which I believe are of relevance to the Australian people. The referenda will facilitate the holding of simultaneous elections and the transfer of powers from the States to the Commonwealth and from the Commonwealth to the States. If the Liberal-National Party agrees with State rights and State sovereignty it should support the referenda too.

         —What absolute rubbish. The Minister does not even know the consequence of this election which will be, presumably, a half Senate election. Those who will be elected to the half Senate will, of course, not take up their places until 1 July 1985. Why do we need to go to the polls before then? There is absolutely no reason to do so.

        The Constitution Alteration (Terms of Senators) Bill and the Constitution Alteration (Interchange of Powers) Bill, which are before us, are designed to try to ensure that the Australian people henceforth will have a Senate with the same term as House of Representatives members, so that it will not be necessary, we are told, to have the two Houses going out on different dates. The Prime Minister could very easily exercise his option to have an early election any time up to 30 May, perhaps 30 April if he wants to allow a bit of time up his sleeve. It would be quite practical in that way for the two Houses to be elected together, but there is no need to have the two Houses elected together. This is purely a subterfuge. Indeed, having looked at the two Bills I believe the con of the consensus is like the con of the two constitutional proposals. It is a con. It has been put in such a way as to deceive the Australian electorate. Frankly, the argument that it is necessary to change the Constitution so that we will avoid having different times of elections just does not hold water.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition-that is, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia-opposes both Bills. We believe that the Australian people too will oppose them. When the referendums to which they give rise are put to the nation I am sure the Australian people will see them, as they do so many of the other actions of this Government, as being nothing more than a cynical exercise of power. We oppose the Bills for very straightforward and plain reasons. We are certain that our stand will be supported by a majority of Australians. These Bills, like so many of the Government's actions-indeed the Government itself-we believe are a fraud. The Constitution Alteration (Terms of Senators) Bill is not , as the Government has pretended, about fewer elections. It is about more elections. It is about reducing the power of the Senate. It is about increasing the power of the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Lowe suggested that there would be fewer elections. That just is not true. Indeed, quite the reverse would be the product of the support by the Australian electorate of these two measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Constitution Alteration (Interchange of Powers) Bill is not, as the Government has pretended, an important step forward in constitutional reform. It is simply a device to throw a cloak of respectability over the Prime Minister's and the Government's attempts to shackle an unco-operative Senate and give further power to a Labor Prime Minister who already shows a dangerous willingness to believe in his own infallibility. These Bills were part of a package of constitutional reforms originally proposed by this Government and supported by the Opposition. The reforming zeal of this Government, or what there was of it, has, of course, long since been spent. What we are left with is a cynical, opportunist attempt to manipulate the referendum process.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is only one reason for introducing these Bills. It is the Prime Minister' s blind determination to push the nation into an early election. If one looks at the faction fighting within the Australian Labor Party and the extent to which members of that Party are currently spending so much more time within the factions fighting one against the other than they are in governing the country, one can understand the Prime Minister's concern to get to the polls early before it all crumbles around him. Nothing and nobody have been allowed to stand in the Prime Minister's way. Labor's election promises, its policies in so many areas, have all been jettisoned. The Government has even thrown overboard any pretence to economic responsibility by bringing down a Budget a fortnight ago that for the sake of a few votes has put lasting recovery and a real increase in the living standards of Australians at very considerable risk. Now we have these Bills which, as I have said, represent a cynical attempt to manipulate the referendum process and the Australian electorate, and are an indictment of the Hawke Government's pretensions as a government of reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        To demonstrate that I will take honourable members on a little tour of the background to these proposals. It all began back in April 1983 when the Attorney -General (Senator Gareth Evans), with a great flourish, announced a series of referenda, including one on fixed term parliaments, to be put to the people in August of that year. Legislation to implement those proposals was, in fact, introduced and, as part of its propaganda campaign, the Government made great play of the decision of the previous Prime Minister to go to the polls early in 1983. However, as we all recall, these proposed referenda were soon postponed. The great reforming Attorney-General was thoroughly and comprehensively rolled by his Cabinet colleagues, who suddenly came to see merit in the ability of a Prime Minister to call an election when he believed it was necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        From fixed term parliaments we went to four-year parliaments. Legislation for a referendum on this issue was brought into this House in the Budget session last year. It was accompanied by a Bill for a referendum on simultaneous elections for both Houses. The Opposition saw merit in these proposals because it believed they would help bring stability to government. The proposed four-year term was, we believed, an important move, for reasons which have been widely discussed both in this House and outside. It would enable governments to concentrate on the job in hand and particularly on rational and proper economic management, without the constant temptation of forthcoming elections. Indeed, we know that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Barry Jones) believes there are problems in the imminence of elections. We have been told by him that taxes have to be increased. A government cannot possibly plan in the long term if it is planning in the context of an early election. We were told that the attitude which the Minister for Science and Technology has used to bucket the planning within this Budget was part of the original concept for the introduction of these measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        There could well have been objections to the Senate having a fixed eight-year term. We all remember the concern there was as to whether an eight-year term would not be unnecessarily long for a House of review. We certainly believed in a context where a fixed eight-year term was in mind that the proposal for simultaneous elections could be justified, for it would have reduced below that fixed eight-year term the term which those senators would have enjoyed. At that stage, these questions were to be put to the people in February this year. Had they been carried-as I have said, they were supported by the Opposition-there would have been no need for a half Senate election by 30 June next year and no need for an early election for this House to be considered. It was not long, however, before this flickering remnant of the Government's reforming zeal was extinguished. Even these reforms, mild as they were compared with the Government 's original plans, presented too great an obstacle to the great Prime Minister. He wanted an excuse to dump them. That excuse came when the Senate, quite properly, refused to allow the Government to spend $2.5m of taxpayers' money to publicise only its case in the February referenda and no funds at all on the opposing side.
       </para>
       <para>
        This decision by the Senate-as I said, it was a very proper one-was misused by the Prime Minister as an excuse for not going ahead with the referenda. Now we have the final product of the reforming zeal of the Hawke Government. What is proposed, of course, is no reform at all. It is a fraud. The fraud is exposed in the very title of the Bill which is before us today. When it was introduced in the Senate its title was the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill. That title, however, has undergone a sudden change. It is now called the Constitution Alteration (Terms of Senators) Bill. That is what this Bill is really about. Let us forget all the nonsense about reducing the number of elections. That has absolutely nothing to do with it. This Bill is about making sure that a hostile Senate or, heaven forbid, even a relatively independent Senate presents the smallest possible obstacle to the wishes of this Prime Minister. That is what this Government is asking Australians to agree to.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present, Prime Ministers who wish to call early elections have a restriction . Elections for the House of Representatives can take place at any time. The Constitution, however, provides fixed terms for senators. Thus if a Prime Minister calls an early election for the House, as the present Prime Minister seems intent on doing, he will be faced with the prospect of another poll later with the prescribed half Senate election. He is also faced with the prospect of continuing separate half Senate and House of Representatives elections unless a double dissolution is called to bring elections for both the Houses back into line. These restrictions act as a powerful brake on Prime Ministers abusing their power to call early elections. They also act as a powerful brake on the number of elections which Australians have to face. They mean that the Senate can perform its proper duties effectively, with a degree of security of tenure and independence of the whims of the Labor Prime Minister or indeed of any Prime Minister. This Bill is aimed at removing those restrictions. There would be two distinct results if the referendum proposed on this issue were carried. The way would be open for more elections. The independence of the Senate, and thus its power would be reduced and that of the Prime Minister enhanced.

        The National Party believes that neither outcome is in the interests of the nation. That is why we, together with our coalition Liberal partners, oppose this Bill and will oppose the passage of the referendum on this issue. We were prepared to support a proper package of reform which coupled simultaneous elections with a four-year parliamentary term.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will not-we cannot-support this cynical, opportunistic attempt to increase the power of the Prime Minister and to foist even more elections on Australians. We regard the interchange of powers proposal as simply an attempt to put a cloak of respectability over this move. The Constitution already permits the States to refer powers to the Commonwealth. They have not generally done so, for the very understandable reason that they prefer to exercise those powers themselves. This proposed referendum will not change that situation. It is not a demonstration of the Government's commitment to reform; it is a demonstration of its cynicism. The coalition opposes both of these Bills for the reasons I have given. It believes, further, that referenda should not, in general, be put to the people at the same time as an election. By doing so, the Government is preventing the people from focussing on the important issues involved. We believe that this aspect of the legislation before the House is also to be condemned.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view the two propositions that are being put to us at this time are not ones which should enjoy the support of the Australian people. In our view they are proposals which are cynically designed to increase and not reduce the frequency of elections. We believe the character of the proposals is designed not to enhance the power of the people; it is simply a product of the Prime Minister deciding that this is one way by which his power as Prime Minister can be enhanced and that of the Senate reduced. There is no justification in those circumstances for either this Parliament or the people of Australia giving this Government their endorsement on those two counts. For that reason I urge all Australians to consider very carefully the proposition included within these two referendum Bills and I urge them just as strongly to vote overwhelmingly against them.

         —I will refrain from addressing in any great substance that part of the referenda proposals which relates to the terms of senators-the Constitution Alteration (Terms of Senators) Bill. It seems to me that that has been adequately and quite definitively embraced by my colleagues on this side of the House. The only comments I make in that context are the obvious ones relating to the significant costs involved to Australian taxpayers when there are continual elections either for half the Senate or for the full House or when those elections are extended to cover various referenda proposals.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The exact amount of money needed in those circumstances has already been addressed, although I thought it might be of some value to instance the number of elections that we have had in the last 20 years. In that time there have been 11 elections, only two having been combined elections. There have been three House of Representatives elections, three half Senate elections and three double dissolutions. If they were to remain out of phase, no fewer than seven separate elections would be due in the next 10 years-three for the House of Representatives and four half Senate elections. My colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) indicated that in the context of a half Senate election the cost to the Australian taxpayer is in the vicinity of $17.8m. We have an Opposition which continually decries the various revenue methods embraced by this Government, so it seems to me to be somewhat contradictory that it is here proposing a course that would inevitably result in an increased cost, an extravagantly increased cost, to the Australian taxpayer which certainly cannot be supported in the context of current economic circumstances or, indeed, in any economic circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        I indicated at the outset that I would prefer to concentrate on that part of the referenda proposals which relates to the interchange of powers-the Constitution Alteration (Interchange of Powers) Bill-and I intend to do just that. It is worth noting that both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair)-both temporary leaders-addressed the interchange of powers proposal only in very limited detail . The central thesis to their submissions to this House was that the interchange of powers proposal is merely a camouflage, or a puff, in terms of getting through the other more substantive referenda proposal. I concede at the outset that, in terms of attaching some order of importance to those two referenda proposals, it is quite obvious that the terms of senators proposal is more important for a range of reasons. However, that ought not cloud the reality that the interchange of powers proposal is a very important part of the package and one deserving of support by the Australian community. Indeed, in no case has any member of the Opposition offered any substantive reasons why that particular proposal ought not be embraced by the Australian community. As I have indicated, it was opposed only in the context of their perception of it as allegedly being part of a camouflage, giving some respectability to the other referenda proposal that will be put. That seems to me to be an absurdity. Neither speaker for the Opposition addressed in passing the very fundamental reasons why the interchange of powers proposal ought to be supported.

        What are the problems? Since the decision in the case of Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd v. Victoria of 1983-more commonly known, of course, as the Victoria pipelines case-there has been renewed interest in the whole issue of referral of powers, not only from the Commonwealth to the States but also vice versa. In that case, as has been rightly pointed out, the major issue related to excise duties, a cause of much debate in terms of our legal and political systems over many years. The law report books are filled with various cases addressing precisely what constitutes excise duties. But in that case it simply seemed to me to present another example of Federal and State governments balancing their obligations and enabling certain financial issues to be addressed in terms of both what the Commonwealth wants and what particular States may desire. It seemed to me to be a good example of when referral of these sorts of powers may have been of some real value.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality, in terms of the second proposal before the House, relating to the interchange of powers, is that, unlike the position put by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the Bill will definitely overcome any doubts which the States hold about the basis upon which references of power may be made by them to the Commonwealth. In fact, the Bill makes it clear that a reference given by the States will be revocable. That has been one of the ongoing causes of concern relating to referral of powers over the years. It may be given subject to conditions-another area of dispute over time-and include in that context conditions regulating the types of laws that can be passed under it and, further, that such references may be made for a limited period. Designations of matters by the Commonwealth Parliament will be subject to the same provisions as those relating to references by the States in relation to revocation, the power to impose conditions and other related matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another part of the proposed referenda relates to Commonwealth places. Of course, this is not a matter of very great moment in terms of day to day politics, but in some areas of litigation it is quite a problem. Since the decision some time ago of Worthing v. Rowell and Muston Pty Ltd significant advances have certainly been made in this area, essentially by agreement between the Federal and State governments. Nevertheless, most observers agree that it is an area that still leaves open to considerable doubt the exact role of Commonwealth and State powers where they conflict in terms of Commonwealth places. Certainly, if we are given the opportunity to redress that problem we should embrace it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the proposal in paragraph (c) of proposed new section 108A(2) is to ensure that no exclusive powers of the Commonwealth are beyond interchange with those of a State. Again, this proposal is the result of discussion in the community over a very long period as to precisely what form of agreement should eventually be arrived at. Another important area was explicitly put in the Bill in response to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, who treated this proposal in a somewhat cavalier fashion. I refer to paragraph (d) of proposed new section 108A(2) which relates to the matter of the investing of a specified Federal court other than the High Court with State jurisdiction in matters of a specified kind. Since the decision in Fencott v. Muller the Federal Court of Australia can determine non-Federal issues forming part of a Federal controversy before the Court. That was a pioneering decision that very much reduced the jurisdictional problems facing Federal Court litigants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation in the State Supreme Courts has yet to be resolved. Far from waiting for a High Court decision to resolve the issue, it seems to me to be important that it should be contained in part of the referenda proposals put before the Australian people. The object of these proposals is that the Federal Court should have power, where the ordinary tenets of justice dictate, to refer to State courts certain powers by way of remitter. As a natural corollary the proposal provides that State Supreme Courts may do likewise in similar circumstances; in such cases they may remit matters to the relevant Federal court.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall not go on in any greater detail. As I indicated at the outset I was concerned with addressing myself solely to the issue of the interchange of powers simply because it had not been addressed in any substantive way by any of the previous speakers. I see my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) and I am reminded of part of his contribution to this debate which related to the costs involved in running elections. I have already addressed costs in terms of the sheer number of elections we have had and will have over the next 10 years. The honourable member for North Sydney instanced in his contribution the increase in the size of the Parliament. It seems to me that one can continue to put confusing arguments over time and they may or may not be embraced by members of the Australian community who are listening to this debate or who read newspaper reports or whatever on this subject.
       </para>
       <para>
        It bears reiterating that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), the relevant Opposition spokesperson on this matter in this House, proposed by way of amendment to the legislation setting up the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform that it have as a specific term of reference the matter of the size of the Parliament. So it was by way of an Opposition amendment that that matter was even brought before the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. Once the Committee was established the National Party of Australia-not, I might add, the Australian Labor Party because in our submission we made no reference to the proposed increase in the size of the House-made submissions in which it argued, I might add, very cogently, that the size of the House should be increased. For my part as a member of that Committee I was never strongly wedded to the concept although I must say that the arguments put forward had merit. Whilst we would concede on any day of the week that the decision to increase the size of Parliament may be seen as unpopular, it is a decision that simply had to be made in the near future, particularly in the context of the construction of the new Parliament House. For all those reasons, particularly those relating to the interchange of powers, I commend the legislation to the House.

        That is patently untrue. This Bill proposes to remove the discretion of State Premiers with respect to the calling of a Senate election and to put the power into the hands of the Prime Minister. It represents a reduction in States rights . It represents an attempt to make the House of Representatives supreme over the Senate. The whole case is a fraud. I think it should be exposed as a fraud and I am amazed that the Government has succeeded so far in perpetrating what amounts to a miscarriage of justice without any responsible comment, apart from a comment made by Malcolm Mackerras, as to the implications for our system of government. It represents no more and no less than a grab for power. It represents political expediency on the part of the present Government to enable it to be in a position to call an election whenever and wherever it likes.

        Something that should be considered is the history of Senate elections in Australia. Under a previous Labor Government the Premier of Queensland found it necessary to deny and then alter the provisions for calling a Senate election. Once this Bill is proposed and passed the rights of Premiers to control and agree to Senate elections will go out the window. It will become the prerogative of the government of the day to determine when an election will be called.

        We saw the cynical use of such powers in New South Wales by the Premier of that State when he called an election on 24 March this year. He went to the Governor and maintained that he could not govern. He asked for an election, rushed back and went to the people, knowing full well that the whole thing was totally unnecessary. He called the election with minimum notice for the people and disenfranchised thousands of people throughout New South Wales. The Bill proposes to give the present Government exactly the same power. It amounts to an attempt by this Government to contrive a political situation which will perpetuate its power and implement the proposals contained in the Australian Labor Party platform and policy. I refer to its policy of centralising control and manipulation of government in Canberra rather than decentralising control to the States, where it rightly belongs.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we see in this Bill is a determined attempt to centralise and to eliminate the rights of States. I am amazed that more has not been made of it in the Press . I am amazed that State governments have not objected to it and I am amazed that political commentators have not exposed it for what it is. I do not understand how the Attorney-General can justify using taxpayers' funds to publish this sort of document which purports to put the case for simultaneous elections. I have put questions on notice regarding how money was allocated, why the documents were not printed by the Government Printer and what has happened to them. None of those questions has been answered.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find it amazing that the Government has been able to get away with making a statement which is patently untrue and which it has not in any way attempted to refute. What we have is a statement made under the authority of the Attorney- General that the Government cannot govern effectively unless this Bill becomes law. This country has been governed effectively since 1901 under the law as it presently stands. These changes do not give more power to the Commonwealth, but they patently give the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Government the power to control the timing of House of Representatives and Senate elections and remove the rights of the State Premiers to influence those things. If that is not altering the balance of power between the States and the Commonwealth, I do not know what is.

        I find it amazing that the Government can perpetrate such a fraud on the Australian people while pretending to be genuinely concerned with democracy. I recognise what will be the fate of this Bill: The Government will use its numbers on a party line vote to force it through. I sincerely hope that the people of Australia recognise what is being done to them and will resist it when the time comes to mark on the ballot paper their attitude to it. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that I will be doing everything I can to ensure that this proposal fails.

         —in reply-It is disappointing to have now opposition to the Constitution Alteration (Terms of Senators) Bill and the Constitution Alteration (Interchange of Powers) Bill. That opposition was not apparent on previous occasions. The rationale of the former proposal, as indicated when it was first introduced, was to give effect to resolutions of the Australian Constitutional Convention at meetings in Hobart and Adelaide. It had strong cross-party support on those occasions. The Australian people must be somewhat mystified to find now that there is an objection to the proposal. At the Convention and also in this Parliament across party lines it was deemed to have a great deal of merit, as indeed it has.

        Although elections are now out of sequence because of an earlier termination of a previous House of Representatives before its time, it is almost axiomatic that the Australian people when they express views as to who should govern the country in the House of Representatives should at the same time express views as to who their senators should be. The measure in no way detracts from the Senate. We are in the ridiculous situation, because of a failure to grapple with the rights of the Constitution, that if the Senate keeps exercising powers which we have often disputed, that is, the power to refuse Supply, we in the House of Representatives can be continually sent to the people without the Senate having to face the people to judge the merits of what has happened.

        We nearly destroyed the Constitution in 1975. I make it very clear that if that position were repeated we would divide this nation. It is not possible to gauge the sort of tension and confrontation that could well develop as it did on that occasion, which was brought about purely for political purposes. When the Constitution was framed it was thought that the Senate would be a House of people who had no affiliation with political parties. How wrong were the founders of the Constitution! It is a party political House. It has proportional representation. As we recognise, because of that individuals or splinter groups can exercise influences. In the interests of the efficiency of democracy it is important that we have fewer elections. We are now facing the eighth or ninth election in the last 15 years. It is quite wrong to be now putting forward arguments that the proposals to be submitted to the people will in any way detract from the powers of the Senate. They do no such thing. A half-Senate election costs the taxpayer an extra $18m. I now advert to remarks made on previous occasions. I begin with those made by Mr Doug Anthony in October 1983. He said:

        One way for the Senate to be accountable is for it to face election at the time the House of Representatives does. The Senate itself is due to face an election in a very short space of time. It is inconvenient to have elections at different times of the year when the issues that the people are asked to judge are the same. There will not be separate issues for the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate and the House of Representatives go to the people as political groups. We have the same policies. They are thrashed out by our respective parties and are usually on the economy or such matters. The people judge the issues accordingly. Because of proportional representation there are opportunities for splinter groups to have their representatives in the Senate talk about those matters. On 12 October 1983, Senator Durack said:

The people of Australia do not want to have the frequent elections that have been thrust on them. On some occasions the Senate has refused Supply and on others Prime Ministers, because of what is deemed to be political advantage, have called elections, thus putting the Houses out of kilter. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) is on record as making a number of statements about the simultaneous elections proposal. He has also talked about the four-year proposal.

A four-year term certainly would not prevent a Prime Minister from going to the polls before the end of that term. That was never the intention. We would love to talk about it, but public opinion and the States are opposed to it. We have to consider it from the point of view of what is feasible. The Opposition does not help to formulate public opinion by opposing the measure in the way it is now doing. It would have been far more beneficial to have talked about the issue. It has become a political issue again and the like of State Premiers and others will use this as they did before to try to defeat the referendum proposals. There is no point in now talking about the fixed four-year term; it has to be looked at in terms of the situation at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other difficulty is that the Senate itself is not prepared to talk about a four-year term or an eight-year term. There is no clear public opinion on that issue. The honourable member for North Sydney weakens his own argument when he says, as he did, that he hopes that the Australian people will accept the proposal. We think they will. We think there is logic in having simultaneous elections rather than having an election for the Senate on a different occasion from a House of Representatives election. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) on another occasion had this to say about simultaneous elections:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . it will mean that there will be fewer elections . . . there is no doubt that there will be a very significant saving in terms of money . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst the honourable gentleman from North Sydney is entitled to say that he would favour a four-year term, I cannot see that the proposal is in any way weakened because of its simultaneous aspect. The honourable member made the point:
       </para>
       <para>
        This will be welcomed by the majority of Australian people and will not, I think, injure the Senate's independence.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not talking about the period here; we are talking about the simultaneous aspect. I could not agree with the honourable member more. On that issue, we now see a complete about-face. The honourable member for North Sydney also said this in earlier days:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth while remembering two things: First, the different system of elections which applies, in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish I had read this earlier because the honourable member has said what I have said. He was talking about Australian Democrats when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet none of the representatives of that Party who stood in the last election or indeed the election before that got anywhere near being elected in the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is a basically different concept of election and it is a question of the people having an ability to judge at that time. I am saying that what the honourable member for North Sydney said then still applies now.
       </para>
       <para>
        The interchange of powers proposal is a very sensible and understandable proposition and I cannot see why anyone would want to object to that. A whole series of statements has been made suggesting that simultaneous elections may lead to more not fewer elections because without the restraint of a half Senate election occurring at three-year intervals, a Prime Minister can call an election whenever he wants to. Half Senate elections do not impose a restraint on a Prime Minister to call an early election; in fact the possibility of a separate half Senate election is more likely to be the cause of his doing so. On a number of occasions since the 1960s, an early House of Representatives election has been called in order to avoid the expense and inconvenience of a half Senate election. In other words, history shows that the trigger for an early House of Representatives election has commonly been the prospect facing the country of a separate half Senate election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another argument is that simultaneous elections will increase the power of the Prime Minister. As was pointed out by Mr Anthony before he retired from the House, the Prime Minister can already create the circumstances for a double dissolution and call out the whole of the Senate if he wants to. He has the power in effect to call a half Senate election at any time within the 12 months before the places of retiring senators become vacant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other argument is that this is part of a Labor Party campaign to destroy the Senate. That is quite ridiculous. The proposal has no effect on the powers of the Senate.

         —I think you should apologise; you are about 12 years behind. The other argument is: What is the advantage in abolishing so-called unnecessary separate half Senate elections when there have only been four since Federation? That assertion is misleading. It is true there have only been four separate half Senate elections since Federation but three of those have been in the past 20 years. We are really accelerating the pace. Out of 11 Federal elections in that time, only two have been simultaneous elections for the House and half the Senate. We are getting worse because of this problem of manipulation of the situation for political purposes, contrary to the public interest.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Another argument is that referendum proposals should not be put at the same time as an election. For the life of me I cannot understand that. Referendum proposals have commonly been put at the same time as an election in the past. There are significant cost savings. Indeed, when the previous referendum package was put before the Parliament some Opposition members argued that the referenda should be put in conjunction with the election. I have already quoted Mr Anthony as saying that as recently as 20 October last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then there was the argument against the interchange of powers, that it is of minor significance and has been put up only to give a veneer of respectability. Let us face it: The interchange proposal is designed to foster greater co- operation between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to their powers and can have very significant results, particularly if one looks at it from the family law point of view and the question of adoption, custody and matters of that nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am aware that time is pressing and all I want to say is that we in the Government are disappointed that the Opposition for paltry party political purposes has decided today to adopt a stance which was not in accordance with the high principles it espoused earlier. We think that the Australian people will judge this on its merits. It will be put to them and we hope it will be agreed to with the co-operation of all right-minded people. We do not want to go back to the days of separate elections. I do not think that adds to the strength of our democracy and it does nothing for the welfare of the nation. Accordingly I ask that the arguments put forward by the Opposition be rejected.

Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.

         —These are very important Bills because they are the first batch of Budget Bills to be debated in detail by the Parliament. I should say at the outset that, because these measures comprise part of the Government's Budget, it will not be our intention to vote against them at the second reading stage. I shall, however, be moving an in-principle amendment at the second reading stage dealing with certain aspects of the timing of the introduction of the proposed tax on Australian and imported wine. Because they are general sales tax Bills, the House is given the opportunity of debating in general aspects of revenue collection by the Government and matters relating to the revenue base.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As honourable members will be well aware, sales tax comprises a very significant proportion of the total revenue collections of the Commonwealth and in those circumstances it is entirely appropriate in debating a sales tax measure to say something about the revenue base not only of this Budget but also of future Budgets. Of course, that leads me unavoidably to what I see as the major problem the Government has created for the government of the day next year as a result of bringing down the Budget which was presented to this Parliament by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) a bare two weeks ago. The unassailable fact is that next year we will have in this country a major budgetary problem. This year 's Budget has been essentially built upon a fortuitous one-off surge in revenue collections which cannot conceivably be repeated next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to spend a few moments tonight analysing that proposition and supplying some reasons why I believe that in the interests of a fairly short term political expedient this Government has created a quite worrying budgetary problem for next year. As I think I have said on another occasion, this might not be the first occasion on which an Australian government has fallen into that error. But that does not alter the culpability of this Government for the problem that it is creating for next year, nor will it alter the magnitude of the task that will face the government of the day next year in putting together the 1985-86 Budget. This year it is anticipated that total revenue collections will rise by no less than 10.7 per cent in real terms; that is, after we allow for inflation the total amount collected by the Commonwealth Government through this Budget will be 10.7 per cent greater than it was last year. On its own that does not sound very remarkable, but when we look back through the Budget Papers and find that that is the largest increase in revenue collections to have occurred on any occasion since the end of World War II, we realise that this year is special and we realise the significance of a government relying upon a special one-off increase in revenue collections on which to base a Budget and a Budget strategy. We also realise the problems that it stores up for next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another statistic that I think ought to be mentioned and kept in mind in this analysis is that this year it is anticipated that provisional tax collections will rise by 44.7 per cent. That does not mean that everybody paying provisional tax will pay 44.7 per cent more, although undoubtedly some fortunate individuals , or unfortunate individuals, depending on how one looks at it, may be in that position. It means that the total proportion of personal tax collections coming from farmers, lawyers, businessmen and all the other people who pay provisional tax is this year going to be almost 45 per cent higher than it was last year. That is a phenomenal increase in anybody's language and I think compares with an average increase of something like 7 per cent or 8 per cent over the last 10 or 15 years. The reason we have that phenomenal increase this year is fairly easy to understand. It is because there has been a spectacular pick-up in the incomes of many farmers because of the end of the drought. They are not by any long term measure earning huge incomes; it is just that the previous year was so dreadfully bad because of the drought that any improvement this year is going to look good by comparison. Because of that improvement we have this quite extraordinary pick-up in provisional tax collections. But the significant thing which I keep coming back to, the problem that the Government has created for next year, is that there is no way on earth that we will get a 44.7 per cent pick-up in farm incomes in 1985-86.
       </para>
       <para>
        As someone on my staff remarked in a very erudite article in the Australian a couple of weeks ago, 'You can only break a drought once', and of course next year we will not be getting the benefit of that 44.7 per cent revenue surge from provisional taxpayers; it will be back to the normal 8 per cent or 9 per cent which is the order of the day. So what the Government has done in the Budget is rely on a once only surge in revenue collections to lock itself into budgetary commitments that cannot possibly be met in future years without an enormous expansion in the size of the Budget deficit next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        At Question Time today we were promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that, if his Government is re-elected at the election that will be held presumably before the end of this year, taxation levels will not rise next year. He gave that promise when he answered a question, and he cannot back away from that quite deliberate promise. He said: 'Overall taxation levels are not going to rise next year if my Government is re-elected'. He was unambiguous in saying it. If he really means that he has to answer a very simple question. I can promise him that he will be asked that question often enough in the weeks and months ahead. He has to explain to the Australian people how on earth he will reconcile the difference that must inevitably open up next year between his revenue base if he is re-elected and the expenditure commitments that he has locked this Government into, because next year we will not have a 44 per cent rise in provisional tax collections; next year we will not have a 10.8 per cent increase in tax collections in real terms over and above inflation; and next year we will not have those fortuitous one-off circumstances that have presented the Government with an opportunity this year which it has passed up and which I believe the Government and the community generally will live to regret that it has passed up.
       </para>
       <para>
        The truth is that this year revenue collections increased by something approaching $9,000m. The Government has achieved a deficit reduction of about $1 .3 billion of that approximately $9 billion. What has it done with the rest? It has, in plain, simple, old-fashioned language, spent the rest of it. Instead of using the bulk of that $9 billion temporary, fortuitous, once only surge in revenue collections to bring about a reduction in the structural deficit, to bring about a reduction in those on-going commitments of the Government which cannot be attributed to high unemployment, to temporary factors that will go out of the system, it has spent the additional money. That is the worst possible thing the Government could have done. It might appear to be the smart thing in the short term; it might appear that it has done a Houdini trick by reducing the deficit and also providing a taxation cut, but that is almost unavoidable if there is a $9 billion rise in revenue collection. One has to be a bit of a mug Treasurer with $9 billion extra not to be able to give some kind of taxation cut and achieve some kind of reduction in the deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it is the magnitude of what the Government has done that really matters. The Government has applied something like 75 per cent of that once-off surge in revenue collections towards additional expenditure. That is what is going to come home to haunt the Australian community next year because next year we will not have that huge rise in farm incomes. In fact the Bureau of Agricultural Economics is forecasting that next year farm incomes will fall by 30 per cent on what they are this year. I hope that does not happen, but I think it will because, as I said a few moments ago, you can only break a drought once. So the Government has dug the budgetary-making process of this country into a very big hole next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we go through the other sources of revenue we do not get a great deal of comfort from them. Anybody who took any notice of what Sheik Yamani said last night during the Copland Memorial Address would realise that crude oil levy receipts will not be a growing source of revenue for the Commonwealth over the next few years. If we look at income tax collections generally we have the ringing statements of the Prime Minister: 'We have reduced them and we will not increase the income tax burdens on the ordinary Australian taxpayer'. That is the claim that is being made. If we go through all the different revenue items we find that next year we will have a problem to which the Government has not addressed itself. This year it has increased expenditure by 6 per cent in real terms after 7.5 per cent in real terms last year. That means that under this Government the rate of increase in government spending is treble the rate that it was under the previous Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know that there are many in the community who argue that the level of restraint on spending by the previous Government might have been better, but we were absolute paragons of virtue when it came to expenditure restraint compared with this Government. Obviously it has demonstrated that it does not have any stomach for expenditure restraint, so I ask the question once again: What is going to happen next year? It is all very well for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to generalise but they are hard questions because when the government of the day, whoever it may be next year, gets the first advice on likely revenue projections it will have a very rude shock awaiting it. Instead of a nice, handsome, 44 per cent rise in provisional tax payments it will be told it is about 6 or 8 per cent. It will be told that its on-going expenditure commitments are rising by another 6 or 7 per cent over and above the rate of inflation because the Government has locked itself into ever-escalating expenditure programs. It has run around the country saying: 'We have committed ourselves to enormous increases in education expenditure'. This year health expenditure goes up by 40 per cent over and above what it was last year because the real cost of Medicare is finally coming home to roost.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I get back again to the central question, and it is the great unanswered question of this year's Budget, and that is: What about the problem that the Government is creating for next year? It is not a sufficient answer for the Treasurer or the Prime Minister to say that this sort of problem has happened in the past. It may have, and if it has that is to the condemnation of those responsible. But it does not alter the responsibility of this Government, which brought down this Budget and which has created this problem for next year, to provide some kind of explanation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addressing some remarks to these sales tax measures I ask the fundamental question which so far has not been answered by the Treasurer, despite numerous questions by the Opposition to the effect: What on earth does the Government believe is to be done about next year's budgetary problem? How can it justify spending 75 per cent of new revenue collections which are not going to be repeated next year? I repeat that they are not going to be repeated next year. If I am wrong on that I would welcome correction from my friend the honourable member from Hunter (Mr Robert Brown), who no doubt will follow me at some stage in this debate. He normally makes very reasonable and sensible contributions to these sorts of debates but he will have to be at his reasonable and most sensible best tonight in order to get out of this one because no one can create money out of thin air; not even the honourable member for Hunter can claim to have the capacity to do that. I do not think anybody on the other side can claim to have that capacity. I would like to hear from the honourable member for Hunter how the Government will replace this amount. He will probably talk about growth because the Government is big on growth. It is the new virtue in the Australian Labor Party. It used to hate growth until it realised that unless there is growth and unless there are some profits it is very hard to employ people. Now it is very big on growth and it waxes very eloquent when it comes to growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        While addressing the Confederation of Australian Industry the other evening the Prime Minister gave the sweeping undertaking that when he restructured the tax scale-he would not tell us how he would do so, and presumably it will be kept under wraps during the election campaign-it would not involve an overall increase in tax. He made this interesting statement: 'You do not need to reduce expenditure in order to reduce the deficit provided economic growth exceeds the rate of growth in government spending'. That sounds a fairly logical, simplistic , fair and reasonable statement to make. I can see the honourable member for Hunter is nodding assent to what his Leader said on that subject. The only problem is that the Government has got off to an awfully bad start because this year growth is projected to be 4 per cent according to the Budget Papers and spending is projected to be 6.1 per cent in real terms. On that sort of scenario the Prime Minister is confirming that next year the deficit problem will be worse than this year. So I advise the Government not to run that one very strongly unless it is able to produce a situation where each year the rate of growth of government spending is less than the rate of expected economic growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far on average this Government has chalked up 6.5 per cent in real terms- that has been its strike rate-in increases in government spending in the two Budgets it has brought down. In order to validate the Prime Minister's proposition for each year that the Labor Government has been in power-in my reckoning that is two-it will have to have produced an average growth rate of more than 6.5 per cent. That is just not possible because next year we will fall back to 4 per cent. So I would not run that one. So the Government is left with some very embarrassing questions. It will really need to be a virtuoso performance from the honourable member for Hunter to provide some explanation of where the money is coming from.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to those immortal words of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Barry Jones), about which honourable members will hear plenty from us between now and polling day. He made a totally candid statement on The World Today program the week the Budget was brought down. He was lamenting the fact that he had not done too well at Budget Cabinet for his portfolio and how science really was not politically popular enough to merit a big increase in funding. He said: 'You know, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is that three or four months before an election the Government is not really game to bring in all those taxes it needs to bring in in order to fund its expenditure commitments'. My friend the Minister for Communications (Mr Duffy) may well shake his head, not at me but at his colleague, for what he said because--

         —Oh, yes, he did. The reality is that the Minister for Science and Technology was saying what everybody knows; that is, if the Hawke Government is re-elected it will have three options open to it. Given the fact that it has chalked up deficits in two years which are almost as great as the ones we chalked up in seven years and that it has produced deficits which are $3 billion to $4 billion higher than the largest deficit we ever produced, its first option is to live with an unacceptably large deficit next year. Its second option is to embark upon a program of expenditure restraint that it has never even contemplated as a Labor Government and which, of course, it will not have the courage to say anything about during the forthcoming election campaign. Thirdly, Barry Jones, the Minister for Science and Technology, really let the cat out of the bag when he said: 'We will have to put up taxes. We will have to impose all of the taxes that we are not game to talk about before the election campaign'. He said that in plain simple language. Of course, he was talking the truth. Out of the mouth of a candid, avuncular, nice, well-meaning Minister came these gems of wisdom. Of course, the Minister for Science and Technology was apparently rebuked by the Prime Minister. He was rebuked for his candour.

        I am not the only person who is making these statements. Let me refer honourable members to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, repeated in today 's Age, written by Max Walsh who, over the last few months, has hardly been one of the Government's most unrelenting economic critics. He has hardly won the Pulitzer Prize for criticising the Government over the last 18 months. What did he have to say? He had an article headed 'The Beginning of the End of the Hawke Government'. The burden of his article was that until the last Budget this Government had the right to claim some long term economic credentials. He said that in the last Budget the Prime Minister and the Treasurer passed up an opportunity to do something of a lasting nature about the structural deficit problem of this country. He pinpointed the very thing that from the night the Budget was brought down I have been talking about, and that is that it is built upon a fortuitous once only surge in revenue collections. The Government has done the worst possible thing with that windfall revenue gain-it has spent it. Once it has spent it, that is the end of it; it can never get it back. The Government has created an absolute nightmare of a Budget problem for next year. It is a decision that the Australian community will pay very dearly for in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have heard a lot of nonsense, cant and hypocrisy talked in this Parliament about deficits and national debts. The unassailable fact is, despite all the rhetoric of the Government, despite all the blustering of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister on the subject, that this Government in two Budgets has produced deficits of $8 billion and $6.7 billion. The largest deficit the last Government ever produced was $4.3 billion and nothing this Government can do will ever alter that. All the misleading, dishonest statements that are made by the Government to the opposite do not alter that fact. But those sorts of comparisons and arguments will be reduced to pigmy proportions by the deficit problem we will face next year because of the folly and the political expediency that has overtaken the Government in the framing of this year's Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remember when the forward Estimates were released this year-the forward Estimates, I might say, of expenditure because the Government, strangely, interestingly and illusorily enough, did not release the forward Estimates of revenue-we were told that the Government was going to fight very hard to contain the growth in outlays to 3 per cent or 4 per cent in real terms. That is what the forward Estimates said. I found in Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald an absolutely fascinating article written by Ross Gittins, an economics writer for the Sydney Morning Herald, a person whom I like immensely although I disagree with a number of the things that he says.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here, let me say that I do not think over the last 18 months the Government has had warmer support from a leading economics writer in Australia than it has had from Mr Gittins, who is a true believer, as he will confess himself, in the prices and incomes accord. I suppose it is on that point that I depart from Mr Gittins. But I nonetheless read his material with very great interest. It is always well researched and he always argues a very tidy intellectual case. He made the very interesting observation that he thought the reason the Government did not release the forward estimates of revenue this year and therefore the forward projection of the Budget deficit when it started its Budget exercise was not that it was too high but that it was too low and that in fact the starting point for the Budget deficit this year was $5 billion. The Government, as he put it, 'struggled and laboured manfully' to reduce that $5 billion to $6.7 billion. There seems to me to be a great deal of compelling logic in what Mr Gittins had to say. He is not the sort of person to make that kind of observation lightly. So here we have the spectacle of this tight-fisted Government struggling against odds to get down the terrible expenditure problem that was facing it and it has been so successful that it has actually 'reduced' the deficit from $5 billion to $6.7 billion. So much for the expenditure restraint stomach of this Government!
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply reiterate that this Government has created a Budget nightmare for next year. Its expedient, opportunistic use of this temporary, once only surge in revenue collections, its totally irresponsible and quite stupid decision to spend it instead of conserving and saving it, is going to come home to haunt the Australian community.

It is very appalling timing at a time when subsidised European wines are disrupting the Australian wine industry and when an inquiry is proceeding into the future structure of the industry. So we have major reservations about the timing of the introduction of this tax.

         —One would have been forgiven for being under the impression, while the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was speaking, that this was a general debate covering questions of the Budget. Of course, it is nothing of the kind. What we are in the process of doing at present is considering three Bills-the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). Because the contribution of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was as wide ranging as it was, I wish to take up a number of issues before I proceed to deal in more detail with the specific provisions of this legislation.
        </para>

       <para>
        The point was made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the call was taken up by other members of the Opposition side that in order to reduce the deficit again in the next financial year the rate of growth of government spending must be less than the rate of real economic growth. That point has been made by them repeatedly. It was made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition again this evening. Underlying this general concern that has been expressed by members of the Opposition is that some of the surges in government revenue which were experienced during the last financial year and which will be experienced again in this financial year will not necessarily be reproduced in the following financial year. They believe that perhaps those surges in revenue will not be reproduced in the following financial year. They use that belief as a basis for asserting that as a result the Government, in preparing the next Budget, will find itself in very serious difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        What those people fail to understand is that while those surges in revenue undoubtedly exist during the current financial year, the way in which that increased revenue has been used in the Budget has had the effect of absorbing that revenue. The assumption appears to be that in the next financial year that increased revenue will not be available. Of course it will be available. It will be available to finance the increased expenditure which this Government quite clearly has undertaken. Let me repeat that. The assumption appears to be that the increased revenue which has been available this year will suddenly disappear in the next financial year. That appears to be fundamental to the argument that has been advanced by members of the Opposition and in particular the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most incredible statements made by the Leader of the Opposition-I am anticipating future developments-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition during his most recent contribution was that the present Government has been responsible for the largest deficits in recent years. He referred to the realised, the actual, deficit during the last financial year, which was about $8 billion. He referred to the estimated deficit for the current financial year of $6.7 billion . Those figures pale into insignificance when one recalls the deficit that the former Treasurer, the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, left for this Government to inherit. I refer to the notorious deficit of $9.6 billion. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to his credit and to the credit of his own personal integrity-I have said this before and I have some respect for his integrity-attempted to make that known to the electorate during the week prior to 5 March last year. The then leader of the Government of the day, the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, refused to allow that information to be divulged.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not deny that that was the information which was given to him. He does not deny that on at least two occasions during that week he sought permission from the office of the then Prime Minister to announce that information publicly. He does not deny that the figure was $9.6 billion. Why then do members of the Opposition become so embarrassed when we continue to refer to the fact that we inherited such a disastrous economic and fiscal situation in Australia? They recognise that that is so. They admit to all of the detail. When we repeat and remind the Australian electorate that we inherited such a disastrous fiscal situation in Australia for some reason they feel that we are not being fair, we are not playing the game, we are misrepresenting the position, despite the fact, as I have indicated, that they never deny the essential facts which lie behind the $9.6 billion deficit that this Government inherited on 5 March last year.

        What a remarkable, dramatic and magnificent result the Hawke Labor Government has brought about in terms of economic management. While I am not necessarily suggesting that the three Bills we are considering at present are a major or a significant part of that total fiscal, economic management, they do reflect the continuing need on the part of governments to examine, re-examine and restructure the general taxation system. Approaches of this kind will always necessarily be undertaken by governments. What we have to do is to look towards those governments which attempt to restructure the taxation system by bringing into the taxation system greater degrees of equity, fairness and justice.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is in marked contrast to the way in which the taxation system was used by the previous Government as one of the tools in its political armoury and as one of its election campaign methods. Plenty of reference has been made to the notorious situation which existed before the 1977 election. The fistful of dollars was used as a bribe by the Government at that time, the Fraser Government, the coalition, the Liberal-National Party Government, in order to court favour, win support and secure votes from an Australian electorate which was very seriously misled on that occasion. I suppose the bait was successful. The votes were won. The Government was returned, but it took back the money. Of course, the fistful of dollars did not remain with the Australian electors for very long. There has been a remarkable transformation in the attitude, direction and objectives of taxation policy as far as this Government is concerned.

        Of course, a particular characteristic of this legislation has attracted the most attention and has encouraged quite legitimate concern on the part of the wine industry, particularly that part of the wine industry in my present electorate in the lower Hunter, the producers of magnificent, premium quality, often expensive wines. That section of the Australian wine industry will be the most severely hurt as a result of the imposition of the 10 per cent sales tax. I would be less than honest if I did not indicate my personal disapppointment that the Government found it necessary to introduce that provision at this stage. I have expressed my disappointment, and it is a legitimate disappointment. I do not resile from that position; nor should I. But I indicate that despite the pedantry and the rhetoric associated with the wording of the quite dishonest amendment which has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, there is no suggestion that the Opposition, given the opportunity, would repeal this legislation. What it is really trying to do is to have a couple of bob each way. It is a change about which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was questioned when he addressed the National Press Club. He was asked about the wine tax and, in a report of his answer-the report puts these words in inverted commas, so apparently it is a direct quote-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, responded by saying:

         —The present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the gentleman who just addressed this Parliament and moved what I have suggested is essentially a dishonest amendment to the motion for the second reading of this legislation. Of course, the Opposition would not reverse or repeal the legislation. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave to the National Press Club was a statement of some substance. I think the whole industry appreciates that the only question with regard to the imposition of a tax on wine was not whether a tax would be imposed, but when a tax would be imposed. I would have preferred that it was imposed on some other occasion, but not because of any possible threat to me in my electorate. The electors in my electorate are the most discerning, the most perceptive electors in any electorate in Australia. They show magnificent political judgment. That is reflected by the fact that the present incumbent in the electorate of Hunter enjoys a majority of about 70 per cent.

         —Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. You are more than generous and I echo the complimentary remarks that were made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in connection with your good self. I express concern, as I indicated earlier, about the way in which the taxation system was used as part of the political armoury of the present Opposition when it was in government. It used taxation rates, tax collections, tax concessions, the tax structure generally and the taxation machinery as its private province and as a means of dispensing patronage to its cronies and to the numerous pampered and privileged sections of the Australian economy which it basically represented. As a result of its seven years in government the Australian tax system became increasingly distorted, inequitable and unjust, and increasingly the burden was placed on those sections of the Australian community which were least able to bear that burden. For seven years that situation developed.

        I have some sympathy for the former Treasurer because I know that his Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, increasingly cut off all of the options which were available to him. I have said before that he is honest. I know that if he were asked whether that was the position, he would have to say that that was the position. It left him like a bird without a feather to fly with. I am sure that it has occurred to the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, that there is some evidence that the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) will make the same mistake. I prevail on the shadow Treasurer to ensure that that mistake is not made because if at any time in the distant future the Opposition is returned to this side of the Parliament-God forbid-I would not like to see it in a position where all the options that may have been available to it to increase the equity, fairness and sense of the taxation system were denied it.
       </para>
       <para>
        By way of background I point out that the present sales tax legislation consists of a number of separate Acts. The Sales Tax Acts Nos 1 to 9 specify the rates at which sales tax is payable. Those Sales Tax Acts Nos 1 to 9 are then supported or complemented by Sales Tax Assessment Acts Nos 1 to 9, which provide the machinery for the assessment, collection and administration of the tax imposed. In addition to those two sets of Acts we also have the Sales Tax ( Exemptions and Classifications) Act. These Acts are referred to specifically in the three pieces of legislation that we are dealing with tonight. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act formerly contained five schedules which listed the various classes of goods and the tax that was applicable to those classes of goods at the various specified rates. Schedule one, for example, listed all of those classes of goods that were exempt goods in relation to sales tax. The second schedule listed those which were taxed at 32.5 per cent. The third schedule listed those taxed at 7.5 per cent, and the fourth and fifth schedules listed those taxed at 20 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present amendments, of course, provide for the addition to those schedules of another schedule, a sixth schedule, which will identify those goods which will be taxed at 10 per cent. Those goods are, of course, Australian produced grape wine. This wine tax must be seen in the context of a total package of taxation proposals on alcohol which are designed to rationalise the total arrangements. As I said before, I express some personal reservation about the timing of those changes. But it is part of a total package and I think it needs to be seen in that way. That total package includes low alcohol beer, the light ales. The excise has been reduced by 8c to 58c a litre. Very low alcohol beer- that beer which contains less than 1.15 per cent alcohol-could not previously be taxed as a soft drink because it was not a soft drink. It had a lower alcohol content than beer, so it could not be taxed as beer. In order to rationalise the absurdity of that position, the Government has provided in the Budget for the imposition of a sales tax of 20 per cent on very low alcohol beer-I think it is sometimes referred to as non-alcoholic beer-which is the same as the tax imposed on soft drinks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sales tax of 10 per cent on wine and on alcoholic ciders is perhaps the major provision in the Bills and the one which quite clearly has caused the greatest amount of concern. The excise collected from the tax that was applied last year on fortifying spirit is to be refunded in full. I know that there is some thought within the wine industry that an approach of this kind is much more appropriate than that which was adopted last year. The tax on fortifying spirit was sectional. It was discriminatory and I know that many of those interests within the wine industry which do not produce the fortifying spirit were of the opinion that an overall tax would have been more equitable. Of course, that is the effect of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The previous 20 per cent sales tax on alcoholic non-grape wines has been lowered to 10 per cent. I wish to express some concern about the change relating to imported wines. Reference has been made to some of these imported wines coming from the European Economic Community which quite clearly are being dumped on the Australian market at present. I wish to express my concern that that is happening and that it is being tolerated. I understand that in the United States , for example, some Italian wines have been dumped at a price of something like $US4 a dozen. That is an absurd situation. If we are not very careful in Australia we will get to that situation as well. As a result of the change in sales tax on those imported wines which has been reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and the Customs duty of 10 per cent which has been imposed to take the impost up to 20 per cent, we are placed in an unfair position in relation to sales tax on the wine we produce.

         —In the exercise of self-congratulation that we have just witnessed from the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) precious little time was spent focusing on what is at the heart of the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills and cognate Bills we are considering tonight. It is not surprising that even a member as courageous as the honourable member for Hunter has been prepared to spend so little time focusing on these Bills because the cognate debate on these Bills is the culmination of 18 months of deception.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This legislation is in fact a bibliography of blatantly broken promises. It is a litany of misrepresentation on the part of the Hawke Labor Government. The seeds of the legislation we have before us tonight were sown in deceit. They took root in the political expediency that is so much a part of Australian Labor Party politics, and they blossomed at Griffith in February 1983 when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was prepared to stand boldly and say, 'Labor is pledged', pledged, mark you, 'not to introduce a sales tax on wine'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is easy for the Prime Minister, day after day in this Parliament just as we witnessed today, in his rasping and arrogant way to take to task the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) for statements he may have made while he was a back bencher. It is easy for the Prime Minister to use Question Time to throw back at the Opposition things he alleges it said. It is easy for the Prime Minister, as he did today, to play to the House and ask it to savour the delectable words he is about to repeat. But it was cynical and hypocritical of him not only to make such a statement today but also in February 1983, for the sake of political expediency, to say to the grape growers of Australia: 'Labor is pledged not to introduce a sales tax on wine'. Never was there a promise or an act so cheaply based. Never was there a commitment so lightly thrown away. That promise was given without any intention to honour it, and it was given by the present Prime Minister, that man of integrity who claims to lead this nation. That promise, given then and since broken twice, was nothing more than a cheap political stunt designed, the Prime Minister hoped, to win the seats of Kingston and Riverina. Unfortunately he was successful in Kingston and fortunately he was unsuccessful in Riverina.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Prime Minister jets around Australia trailing his banner of consensus and integrity when in fact he has been prepared blatantly to mislead the wine grape growers and the citizens of this nation. Not once but twice has he broken the specific promise he made to the wine grape growers who make up the electorates principally represented on this side of the House. Where now is this much vaunted integrity? Where now is this much vaunted principle? 'O, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!' In this case the deception took place not once but twice. The first time was just six months after the Prime Minister made his promise when in the Budget of 1983 he brought down the disastrous 2J spirit impost. Not satisfied with one mistake, an admitted mistake , the Government has repeated the performance in the 1984-85 Budget of two weeks ago. Today the industry finds itself in a confused web of government unpredictability. Just after it had been promised by the Prime Minister that for the first time in its history it could be assured of three years of tax-free existence it discovered that that tax-free existence did not even last six months.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister in his dealings with the grape industry has proven to be utterly unprincipled. He was deceitful to the industry in Griffith, and he is guilty of having paraded consensus and reconciliation but of refusing ever to talk to the industry about what would be in its and in the nation's best interests. There was no consensus and no consultation with the grape industry prior to the introduction of the 2J spirit tax or prior to the introduction of these Bills that we are debating in the House tonight. It would seem that the Prime Minister's concept of consensus is: 'Consensus means doing it my way'.
       </para>
       <para>
        This deception perpetrated on the industry at Griffith in 1983 is bringing an essential Australian industry, and an essential South Australian industry, to its knees. Just a glimmer of honesty would have helped the industry to feel that it could get some sense of purpose and predictability from the Government. But there has not been one iota of honesty. We have seen one expedient political step after another.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Hunter said: 'Well, I am uncomfortable about this legislation, but it has been done to rationalise our tax structure'. ' Rationalise', what a glorious word! It really tells us nothing at all. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) declared that the legislation had been introduced in the interest of equity. Equity! Any comparison between the beer and wine industry which the Treasurer has been so fond of barrelling out is quite erroneous. Do honourable members realise that in the egalitarian days of the Chifley Government beer attracted the same impost as spirits? In 1984 the beer industry is taxed at barely two-thirds the rate of spirits. Is this the sort of equity the beer industry and the Hawke Labor Government want to return to? Do the brewers again want the same tax impost as that which the spirit producers currently bear?
       </para>
       <para>
        Any comparison between the brewing industry and the wine grape industry falls apart when one looks at the way they are structured. They bear little in common at all. The wine grape industry is made up of small businesses. It is labour- intensive. It is dominated by numerous wineries and wine grape growers. As we know, the beer industry involves big business and its turnover occurs inside a six-month period while the wine industry may well take seven years from wine production to maturation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 10 per cent tax contained in these Bills is a tax on a labour-intensive industry. Beer already has a large percentage of the Australian drink market. It is true that percentage is falling but it is not true to say that it is falling because there has not been a sales tax on wine. It is quite erroneous to believe that the wine industry does not pay taxes in any way. The wine industry is in one way or another a substantial taxpayer. It is true that a specific sales tax has not been imposed on it, but the brewing industry cannot say that the absence of a sales tax on wine is the reason that brewery sales have fallen. They have fallen principally because of the changing lifestyles of Australians and those further complicating features such as penalty rates for hotel staff, as the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is well aware, and random breath testing. This Bill, far from achieving better brewery sales, is nothing more than a blatant attack on the very grape growers the Prime Minister had the audacity to say he would protect. Tonight the Opposition is saying that the timing of this particular tax could not be more wrong. It will be alleged that the timing of any tax is never right. The Opposition will agree. But the timing of this tax on grape growers in Australia could not be worse.

        Madam Deputy Speaker, you will recall that last week I asked a question without notice of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin). I asked the Minister whether incomes or employment prospects in grape growing areas have improved under his Government? The Minister stood up and answered in one word: 'No'.

        The timing of this tax could not be worse. Let us look at the grape industry in Australia which is about to be subjected to this ill-advised tax. The dried fruit portion of the grape industry in Australia is currently subject to an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry, such is its dilemma. The brandy industry in Australia is almost non-existent, thanks to the Whitlam Government's decision to remove a provision provided under section 31A of the Act. The grape industry is currently undergoing reconstruction to enable it to adjust after the disastrous way it has been treated by the Hawke Government, the Whitlam Government and, I confess, from time to time by the Fraser Government.

         —The honourable member for Hunter has refused to acknowledge it, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has said that there are good reasons for an equitable tax treatment for alcoholic beverages. The Opposition does not retract from that. The honourable member for Hunter has conveniently hoped that we would retract; we do not. What we declare is not that what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said is wrong, but that now is not the time. In fact, it is difficult to envisage a worse time. The Opposition amendment currently before the House, the amendment to which I address myself, simply asks the Government to look again at the timing of his tax.

        Thanks to what successive governments have done, thanks to the removal of the 31A provision, we no longer have a brandy industry in Australia. It was the brandy industry that provided the wine grape industry with a safety valve. Were there excessive dual purpose grapes that could not find their way into the dried fruit industry or the wine industry, those grapes could be moved into the brandy industry. There is no longer a brandy industry. Those dual purpose grapes are seeking a home in the dried fruit industry and the wine grape industry. The dried fruit industry door has been shut by export pressure, because the dried fruit industry is principally an export industry. Now the Hawke Labor Government is about to close again the wine grape industry door, having jammed it shut with the 2J spirit excise and prised it open again, it is callously about to slam it shut again. The honourable member for Hunter said that the 2J spirit excise was not all that well advised, but that the Government is going to refund the money. Frankly, big deal! The money will be refunded, but it will not be refunded with interest attached. It will be refunded, but it was collected inequitably. What is being refunded is a mere $6m. What is being collected from the 10 per cent wine tax from an industry already on its knees is estimated to be somewhere between $62m and $67m.

       <para>
        If there is one area to which I want to address the attention of the House tonight and one area that justifies our claim that this amendment ought to be passed and that the 10 per cent tax ought to be reconsidered, it is the area of imports of wine into Australia. When I addressed the House in the grievance debate last week, I said that the import area was a matter for major alarm. It is a matter for alarm because while 12 months ago something like 730,000 litres of wine were imported into Australia, in the last 12 months that figure has escalated to 1.3 million litres. This wine is coming into Australia as subsidised wine. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document that was provided by the Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association that illustrates the changes for imported wine as a result of the Government's 10 per cent tax.

         —The table shows that as a result of the changes to Customs duty and sales tax on imported wine in the documents that we are considering tonight, far from the Australian industry being protected, in reality imported wines go up a mere 6c a litre while Australian local wines go up by 10 per cent. In fact, it shows that the price of the imported product is virtually not changed, while the Australian wine has increased in price by 10 per cent. Therefore, Australian wine is disadvantaged relative to imported wine.

        The Bills before the House tonight are nothing more than documents to promote imported wine. They are nothing more than documents designed to burden already overburdened grape growers. They are an attack on a proud Australian industry which has always been competitive and which is, in fact, a major employer. They are an attack on an industry which has long been exposed to, and has encouraged within itself, competition, but which now faces imported subsidised competition which it cannot live with. There can be no comparison between the unprotected Australian grape growers and the threat of this legislation and the sort of protection that we give, for example, to the steel workers of Australia.

        This Bill is a result of no consultation, no consensus. Even the Labor Premier of South Australia, Premier John Bannon, had but 20 minutes notice, he said, of what was happening in this House. He has been as critical as any member of the Opposition of the moves of the Government with these Bills. In fact, in an effort to be as accommodating as I could be of the Treasurer, and fearing that he was receiving advice from the wrong quarters, as early as June 1983 I wrote to him warning him of the consequences of taxing the wine. Clearly, that letter bore no fruit at all. What we are witnessing tonight has been tried in fact three times before-in 1942, 1970 and 1983. It is now to be tried again in 1984. On every occasion, so disastrous has a wine tax proven, it has had to be repealed.

It is that, following the next election, we will repeal the legislation currently before the House.

We are seeking to carry an amendment so that the legislation before the House no longer attacks the frail and burdens the disadvantaged. This amendment allows the Government not to proceed with the 10 per cent tax; to look again at the threat of imports to the wine grape industry; to look again at providing the wine grape industry with some form of protection in the form of stock valuation adjustment; and to look again at consulting with the industry as to how it might best be asked to bear what is seen to be its share of the tax burden.

        My colleagues all support this amendment. The Liberal members from South Australia are united in their support of the amendment. It is interesting to note that in 1978 the tables in this House were turned when foolishly we were proposing a similar sort of exercise. On that occasion there were members of the Liberal Party Government who were courageous enough to cross the floor and vote in support of the grape growers. The challenge tonight to the Labor Party is this: Will the honourable member for Hunter and will the South Australian members of this House be prepared to show similar intestinal fortitude and cross the floor in the interests of the grape growers of Australia?

         —I have a great deal of information to make available on the Bills, but I particularly wish to make some points on the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the Budget. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition provided , in an indirect way, a warning to our Government that when framing our next Budget we should be careful about the degree to which we let Budget deficits in total work ahead for the 1985-86 Budget. He suggested that we had used an opportunity to reduce further Budget deficit. I have been pleased to hear, both in his speech and in a number of other speeches from members of the Opposition, an acknowledgement that if there are any difficulties in the context of framing the 1985-86 Budget they will be difficulties that face this Government and not the Opposition. We are pleased to stand on our record in terms of budgetary and fiscal management. Since March 1983 we have produced two Budgets which have been well received by the Australian economy and the people-

         —They have not been Budgets with the highest deficit in Australian history, as the honourable member for O'Connor has suggested. In fact, as I will indicate in a moment we have done a remarkable job in very difficult circumstances in bringing that deficit down. We are prepared to stand on our record. The Budget is the major economic tool of any government for creating economic management, economic decision making, employment growth, business profits and so on. In that sense it is important-it is imperative in a way-to look at what we have managed to achieve in the space of just two Budgets, compared with what the Opposition achieved in the space of seven or eight years of government and an equivalent number of Budgets.

        I am sure that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, will recall very well the situation when we came to government, prior to framing our 1983-84 Budget. In 1982-83 real gross product had fallen by 2 per cent. Real manufacturing output had fallen by 11 per cent. Private investment in dwelling construction had declined by almost 25 per cent in the year in question. Also by the end of 1982-83 that private business investment was some 30 per cent lower than its pre-recession peak level and it was still falling. Of course, we all know that the labour market had deteriorated sharply. There had been a fall in employment of almost 2 per cent. Aggregate hours worked were falling rapidly and unemployment increased by some 250,000 people to more than 720,000. That was the situation when we took government.
       </para>
       <para>
        In our 1983-84 Budget we provided the framework for sustained economic growth. The effect of that Budget has been in every way to generate economic growth throughout our economy. We have seen employment rise by some 250,000 jobs; we have seen interest rates fall by more than two percentage points; we have seen a consistency of wages and prices across the board through the very successful incomes and prices accord; we have also seen a significant fall in Australia's rate of inflation. That is the situation in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggests to us that we should be looking with caution to future Budgets.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look at total tax revenues and the claim that has been made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, we find that total tax revenues in the 1984-85 Budget are estimated to increase by some 17.9 per cent. That is a significant increase. It largely reflects strong economic growth and it also indicates the full year effects of the Medicare arrangements and the prescribed payment system. Although that is a strong growth in tax revenues, we should note that the gross pay as you earn income tax collections will grow by a much more modest 10.7 per cent over the year and that both gross and net pay as you earn taxes after refunds will represent a smaller proportion of gross domestic product in 1984-85 than in either 1981-82 or 1982-83, the last two years of the former Government. We must put the claims of the Opposition in terms of this Budget deficit in that context . I will repeat it-gross and net pay as you earn income taxes will represent a smaller proportion of GDP in 1984-85 than in either 1981-82 or 1982-83, the last two years of the Fraser Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make one final point on that matter. If we look at the total Budget situation and we exclude the Medicare arrangements, total Commonwealth tax revenues in 1984-85 are estimated to be equivalent to 24.7 per cent of GDP compared with 25 per cent under the previous Government. So there is no substance to the claims made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in terms of this Budget deficit. We have acted responsibly in reducing that deficit to a level of below $7 billion. We managed to reduce the previous Budget deficit from a projected $9.6 billion-a figure which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition readily affirms-and slice some $2 billion off that amount. We have managed again in a fiscally responsible way to reduce the Budget deficit for 1984-85.

        The three Bills before the House are concerned basically with the taxation of wine. Within my electorate of Bendigo there are a large number of very high quality wineries. Within the Bendigo area itself there are such noted wineries as Balgownie and Chateau Leamon, and further north we have wineries such as Passing Clouds. It is called Passing Clouds because the clouds just keep passing over and it never rains. As a result it produces a delightful wine which has won many awards. The area that is proposed to be included in the new seat of Bendigo includes the Pyrenees wine making area of Victoria with such noted wineries as Taltarni, Mount Avoca and Chateau Remy; and the Stawell wine making area which includes the wineries of Bests, Boroka, Seppelts and Great Western. They all produce quality wine. All of those wineries have made a major contribution to tourism and to infrastructure development and economic growth in the area. As a consumer of those wines I can only say that I am exceptionally proud of their development over the last decade. Honourable members might be interested to know until 1906 Bendigo was Australia's premier wine producing area. At that time the grapes were destroyed by phylloxera and it has really been only in the last decade or two that we have seen a resurgence of wine growing in that area. As I say, I am proud of our wineries. They make a great contribution to the region and to the tourism structure of the area.

         —I note that the Opposition is also disappointed. I am pleased that there is some disappointment about this tax. The point does have to be made that whenever any tax is introduced, no one in the Government and I dare say no one in the Opposition likes seeing that tax introduced. But there are several reasons why this wine tax had to be introduced. The first is that it was inevitable that a wine tax would be introduced throughout Australia. Over recent years successive State governments have filled the vacuum created by there being no Federal tax. South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria acted last year to put a tax on wine because the Federal Government had not acted. Of course it is much better, if there is to be taxation, for it to be handled at a national level by the Federal Government.

         —The honourable member for Hunter says that is a good point. In recent years we have seen a wider range of taxes taken up by the States but in many cases it is preferable that those taxes be levied by the Commonwealth because that removes some of the distortions that can sometimes occur between the States with varying levels of taxes. So it was inevitable, and I am sure members of the Opposition acknowledge that. In fact, the Opposition's only amendment to this legislation concerns the timing of the tax. The fact that its only amendment relates to timing suggests that there is an inevitability about such a tax.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The other main reason a wine tax was introduced is that there are very strong arguments on the basis of equity. It has been mentioned previously in debate that if one compares the rate of tax that previously fell on wine compared with that which applies to other alcoholic beverages, it is fair to say that wine was virtually excluded from excise and taxation arrangements. It alone was excluded. I compare wine to beer, which is very heavily taxed. If we applied the rate of tax on beer to wine, we would have an 80 per cent tax on a bottle of wine and probably a 155 per cent tax on bulk or cask wine. They are very hefty levels of tax and certainly no one on this side of the House advocates them but there are fairly strong arguments on the grounds of equity for saying there was some inevitability about the introduction of a wine tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also the argument concerning equity that over recent years it has been possible, because of the distorting aspects of those taxes, to buy in many cases good quality wine at a cheaper price per part alcohol per bottle than beer. I refer particularly to much of the champagne that has come on to the Australian market in the last year or so. It is Australian champagne but in terms of a price per product, in terms of its alcohol content, it is coming on to the market at a lower price than beer. We all have to think seriously about whether that is desirable in terms of equity and overall resource allocation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consumers frequently put to me other comparisons concerning a wine tax. For instance, those who do not drink wine ask why wine should be free when beer is so heavily taxed, and why mineral and soda water is taxed at 20 per cent when there is no tax on wine.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, it has to be said that the effect of heavy taxes on beer has had some effect on its consumption. Since 1976 beer consumption has fallen in real terms by 10 per cent, yet wine consumption has increased at a per capita rate, in real terms per annum, of about 7 per cent, giving an overall percentage increase of some 46 per cent since 1976-77. So wine has certainly done well. I encourage and support that development and believe, as I said, that it has made a great contribution particularly in my area to tourism and local economic development.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the question of timing, raised in the Opposition's foreshadowed amendment, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) was honest enough to say that there is always debate as to when is the right time or the wrong time to introduce a new tax. Of course there never is a right time. There can never be any right time to introduce a new tax on any industry and if a government is going to do it, if a government is going to decide to make that decision, it has to do it. We have made that decision and stick by it. I want to refer also to what I consider to be the somewhat cynical approach to this debate taken by some members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Wakefield stated categorically that the Opposition would repeal the wine tax. I can only be guided, as my good colleague the honourable member for Hunter is guided, by the remarks of the shadow Treasurer and former Treasurer of this country, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and honourable member for Bennelong. When asked by an Adelaide News journalist at the National Press Club on 29 August, the honourable member for Bennelong said:

        I would have to agree with you that there are good arguments for equal tax treatment of all alcoholic beverages.

       <para>
        If we come down to being honest, he is saying that there are good arguments for equal tax treatment for all alcoholic beverages. He could implement such treatment only if honourable members opposite ever get back into government, and I do not think they will for many years. Let us examine his statement. The main tax is levied on beer. I have already said that the rate of taxation which applies to beer, which is consumed by many Australians, is 80 per cent. The tax we have introduced is 10 per cent.

If we put an 80 per cent tax on a $5 retail bottle of wine, its price would be jacked up to $9. I would then agree that that would devastate the industry. Of course it would. If we put a 155 per cent tax on cask wine, we would destroy that part of the industry too.

        But let us look at the effect of this 10 per cent tax. What will it actually mean in terms of price? If we assume a 40 per cent mark-up on retail, a bottle that retails at the moment for $4-by most people's standards that would be a reasonable bottle of wine-would have a wholesale price of $2.40 and if we add a 10 per cent tax, which is equivalent to about 14 per cent on retail because it will be marked up, the net effect of the tax is to lift the price of that bottle from $4 to $4.56. That is the total effect. That is quite different from an 80 per cent tax which would lift it from $4 to nearly $8. We have to get up to the top end of the market and a retail price of $7 or $8 a bottle before the tax would add a dollar to the price.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course the effect on consumption is important. I acknowledge the concerns expressed about the effects that any tax might have on any industry and I acknowledge the concerns about the effects this tax will have on the wine industry. I can assure honourable members that I will be watching the effects of this tax very carefully. But in terms of the effect on demand, there have been a number of studies on the price elasticity of demand for wine. There have been studies by Tsolakis in 1982; by Clements and by Murphy. Tsolakis concluded that the elasticity of wine is -0.43. Clements estimated an elasticity of 0.43 and Murphy estimated an elasticity of -0.31. Based on those results we can assume that the price elasticity for wine is about -0.3 to -0.5. That means that the maximum effect which a 14 per cent increase in price would have on the demand for wine in Australia would be a reduction in consumption of 5 per cent. That is the maximum effect, on all evidence available to the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        To put that in context, it is very difficult to predict the future of the Australian wine industry. If we assume a continued growth of 7 per cent or 8 per cent in real terms per annum, as I think we should, no producer in Australia will be selling less wine than in the past because of this tax. In the last eight years there has been a growth in real terms of 8 per cent per annum. The worst effect that this tax will have is a reduction in demand of 5 per cent. We will still see an increase in demand for wine in Australia of more than 3 per cent in real terms. So producers will not be devastated. My final point is that wines for export, a growing sector of the Australian market, are totally unaffected by this tax. There will not be a 10 per cent sales tax on any wine produced for export. I think that is terrific for encouraging the development of export markets for Australian wine. I know that with the stronger economic conditions and the strong growth in wine production in Australia over recent years we will see increasing export of our wines in the future.

         —I do not intend to speak for long because I know that many honourable members want to speak on this Bill, particularly those whose areas depend on regional development. This Bill to impose a 10 per cent tax on wine will affect them very dramatically. I would like to take the House back to 20 February 1983 on which day I remember driving past the Yoogali Club in Griffith. I saw a great crowd gathered at the front. I was about to go into the club for a squash, as I usually do, but thought I had better not do so because it would be too difficult to get in. Then I realised what was going on. This was the famous deputation that the Australian Labor Party had sent to Griffith to make sure that it won the seat of Riverina. The Labor Party had thought that if the seat of Riverina fell it would be in government, so it brought all the big guns down to Griffith to see what they could do about the situation. As I recall , at that meeting were the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), at least two senators and the State Minister for Agriculture.

        One of the things we have tended to forget tonight when talking about the wine industry is that it is primary production and not a manufacturing industry like beer production. I do not think anyone is really surprised that many of the promises made on that very hot day in Griffith were not kept. I have a book full of promises that were not kept. I will not go into all of these promises because there are so many of them that my 10 minutes would be up before I got through them, so I will leave them. My advice to members of the present Government is that, if they want to make a rural policy speech for the next election, they should not for heaven's sake go to Griffith or into the Riverina because I am sure that they would get a warm welcome which would not be the type of welcome they would expect.

        In August 1983, not long after that promise was made, the excise on fortified spirit was brought in. It was $2.50 a litre, which was really $2.61 because it was indexed almost straightaway. It was only because of the great number of representations by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), myself and other Opposition members that that excise was nearly halved. It went down to $1.50 a litre. Of course, that was only a token gesture. I think the Government then realised the terrible mistake it had made. It had drawn one of these schemes out of a back cupboard but it did not go into it to see what effect it would have on the industry. I know that in the Riverina in particular, in South Australia, as the honourable member for Wakefield will agree, and in Victoria, as the honourable member for Indi and the honourable member for Mallee will agree, the Government almost destroyed the fortified wine industry. Fortunately just as it was about on its knees the Government decided to relent and did away with the iniquitous excise.

We will take it off'. Some of the people involved said: ' Gee, this Government is great. It has done a great job for us. It put an excise on. Now it has taken it off and it looks as though the Prime Minister at last will keep his pre-election promise. Everything will be rosy in the garden'. Of course, a number of the wine makers making fortified wines decided that they were not going to make fortified wines. They would fix the Government; they just would not make it. But some of those trying to employ people and to keep the wine industry going decided they would make it. After a great deal of representation by the honourable members I mentioned previously, fortunately it was decided that this excise would be refunded to those wineries on which this impost had been put. I know that as of last week certainly a number of those wineries still had not seen the colour of the money. I hope that there is 20 per cent interest on that money, as is imposed on those who do not pay their back taxes. I am looking forward to that.

        The wine industry certainly had a little breathing space then. Those in the industry thought: 'We are right now'. Of course, then the Budget came down. What did we find in the Budget? When I first saw the Budget I thought: 'Hello, the Labor Party has done it again'. We remember that some years ago Mr Whitlam dropped section 31A. When I first became a member of the Parliament in 1980 the wineries still had not paid back the moneys owing because of the impost by the Government of that day. I just cannot work out what the Labor Party has against the wine industry.

         —Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is very difficult. I would like to tell the House a true story. I was in a place called Buronga, which is on the other side of the river from the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee. I went to speak to a market gardener there. He was working and I went to say hello. He was very upset. He was a gentleman of Italian origin, and we all know what good farmers those people are and how close they are to the land. He almost had tears in his eyes and he said: 'I had a bit of an argument with my son this morning. I was working in the glasshouse and around the farm and my son came to me and said : ''I hope you are not working like that for me from daylight to dark getting the return you are getting. If you are you can forget about it because there is no way I am going to work like you and get the return that you are getting. I would rather be one of those 1,500 people that Mr Hawke is putting on in the Department of Social Security and other departments. The life is a lot easier and you do not have to work as hard''.' This gentleman was very upset, and I think that really is the understanding of many people on the land. Let me mention some of the costs that are being imposed on the people on the land; there are so many that they will soon not be able to survive. The 10 per cent tax on wine is just one small indication of what the Government thinks of the people on the land. There is also a 15 per cent tariff on headers. We also have the deal that the Government did with the liquefied petroleum gas.

There are excises on fuels, loss of markets through lack of government action overseas, strikes, increased prices and increased labour costs. Let me say that when there is a strike it is a looloo, and it is costing wheat growers and the people on the land. It is not only the primary producers but also the people in the provincial towns and cities who are having to pay for all of this. It is not good enough, and it is about time something was done about it. We are hearing so much about the prices and incomes accord, and I think it comes into the area of the 10 per cent sales tax also. The accord seems to me to be okay for big unions , big business and big government and, of course, it helps those governments who are big spenders.

        I come back to the wine tax. A lot of people here are saying tonight that the imposition of a wine tax was bad timing. I am one of those people who are totally opposed to the wine tax. I know that the brewing industry has mounted a campaign in trying to have a tax imposed on the wine industry, and I can understand the beer industry's problem because it is taxed to a very high degree and I think it is about time that stopped. This Parliament seems to be talking all the time about adding taxes on. I think it is about time we started taking taxes off and stopped the big spending. If we would do that I think the nation would be far better off. I could not agree more with what a number of honourable members are saying here tonight: The timing is bad. We have troubles not only in the wine industry but also in the dried fruit industry. The honourable member for Wakefield, the honourable member for Mallee and myself were at a conference the other day when the troubles of the dried fruit industry were shown to be very great indeed. There is an overproduction there which could go into the wine industry. I have here a letter from the Australian Dried Fruits Association addressed to Mr Keating, the Treasurer. I must admit that I am deleting reference to grape spirit tax and inserting a reference to a tax on wine. The letter states:

I am sure that if the wine industry had been left alone, if the committee had been set up when the Government said it would be, it would not have the problems it has today.

        I totally oppose this 10 per cent tax. I go along with the amendment and I would like it to be on record that I oppose any tax on wine. I do not agree that the Government can say that because there is a tax on other alcoholic beverages wine has to be taxed. It is like saying: 'If I cut my arm off, you cut yours off too'. That is no reason at all. I would just like my feelings to be known. I totally support the amendment and I am sure that all members of the Opposition also support it.

         —When I put my name forward to debate these relatively minor Bills, the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2), I intended to speak about the inequity in the excise system, about the sales tax avoidance issue in terms of sales tax for exporting and reimporting, and particularly to make some comments about the reduction in the excise on low alcohol beer. Then I saw the list and discovered there were eight speakers from the Opposition, so I went through the Bills again thinking: 'Gosh, eight speakers. They will be finding some things that I must not know about'. I could not find what they were looking for so I thought I had better sit in and listen. I thought I must not miss a single word because obviously there will be a lot of gems of wisdom about things that are not apparent. I have now sat through three speeches and I ask honourable members to consider what has been said.

        The previous Treasurer spent 25 of his 30 minutes talking about the Budget in general, and he was the lead speaker. I thought that if the issue warranted eight speakers the Opposition would make its lead speaker talk about the issue and the secondary speakers could go off on tangents. We have not yet had a reasoned argument about the legislation. There has been no mention of the tax avoidance issue or of the reduction in low alcohol excise. All we have had has been a lot of ranting and raving. In fact the last speech was, without doubt, a campaign opening for the seat of Farrer, not the seat of Riverina. Clearly it was aimed at Farrer. At the campaign speech for the seat of Riverina in February of last year another promise was made, the promise of a million dollar loan to the Leeton cannery, which the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) handed over. He did not mention that promise tonight. That million dollars was handed over by him as promised by Mr Hawke in that campaign speech in February 1983. There was not one mention of that promise being kept, and being kept promptly and properly.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, what we have had is rather unfortunate. I would have thought that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, would show us the areas in which he has credibility, such as immigration. Mind you, he was four months too late, but still the credibility was there. But for him to start speaking about promises, projections, Budget deficits and the like just does not wash with the Australian community. Very clearly his record over five years as Treasurer has sunk in very profoundly. The man lacks credibility. He lacks capacity and standing in the Australian community on economic matters. His record is such that it is not to be respected or believed. In fact, in the last few days of the election campaign in 1983 when word was about that the $6 billion projected deficit was shonkey, the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was publicly forced to back down and say: 'Mind you, we assume that they have told us the truth'. He has since proven that that was a false assumption. In effect that whole campaign was based on a set of deceitful and false assumptions and premises put forward by the government of the day. Those who had access to information misled not only the public but also the then Opposition. In fact, as I said, it was not with any great relish that the then Opposition had to give a warning in the last few days of that campaign which was based on what was happening.

         —I am speaking about a 25-minute speech on this legislation-25 minutes of rhetoric from a discredited ex-Treasurer. It is obvious why he is the ex-Treasurer. The fascinating part of the 25-minute speech was this final comment: 'Well, we are not really opposed to the idea or the concept-it is only the timing'. It is quite clear that the Opposition cannot oppose these amendments in principle because they are sound amendments. All that it can put forward as a campaign topic is timing. Of course, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) made the fascinating comment: 'We all agree that with taxation any timing is bad; however, this is worse than most'. That is a fascinating piece of mental arithmetic. The mental gymnastics involved are quite fascinating. That particular gentleman suggests that he is the one who knows when is best or when is worst. I find that quite interesting because the shadow Treasurer in his comments a few weeks ago did not mention timing. He mentioned only the equity as being a reasonable thing to put forward. Suddenly, timing is important. Of course, the irony is that no member of parliament would oppose the proposition that taxation increases of any kind are always difficult. One of the problems of this country has been the shirking of responsibility by those who have occupied the treasury benches for 31 of the last 35 years. As a result we have perhaps one of the most secular and most discriminatory revenue raising systems in the world because they always avoided the difficult issues. I think we are seeing tonight just how and where this has happened.

        I thought that my colleague the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) put forward some very interesting and sound arguments. They were arguments that in fact I would have expected the Opposition to put forward if the data were different. Clearly the data is such as to white-ant its capacity to put forward any constructive argument. The fact is that no facts can be put forward which substantially demolish this legislation. The timing is the only argument that the Opposition can put forward. I think we will hear more about timing in the months ahead when the Opposition tries to avoid its responsibility and tries to duck-shove around what it would do based on the record of what it has not done in the past.

       <para>
        I also find fascinating the suggestion by the honourable member for Riverina-I should call him the new honourable member for Farrer-that as a result of his Party's representations the fortified wine tax was halved. In other words, on the one hand the Opposition is helpless and powerless against this dreadful Government and, on the other hand, the tax was halved last year because the Opposition is so effective. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It is either ineffective or powerless or it is effective. If the Opposition were effective this tax would not have to be imposed because it would have found grounds as to why it should not be imposed.

        Let us get to the real issue of the fear the Opposition is creating with regard to the import of wines. The import of wine is a serious matter, as is the import penetration of any Australian market. The fact is that the import problem will not be solved by not applying sales taxes or varying sales taxes. If imported wine is being subsidised by other governments appropriate action is available. Not one speaker tonight has raised the question of actions available to deal with dumped goods in Australia. If wine is being dumped, why has not one of the three Opposition speakers who have taken part in this debate suggested that positive courses are available? In fact, quite separate machinery is available to deal with tariff-import penetration. One does not use sales tax in competition with imports if the imports are being unfairly brought into the country or unfairly costed. There is machinery under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to address that. Why has not that matter been raised? Why has it not been mobilised? All the ranting and raving on the other side is in fact just that. Honourable members opposite have not addressed the question of import penetration. If this is a serious matter-and I suspect it is-let us address it in a positive and constructive way and not use it as some half-baked excuse as to why the wine industry should not in fact be dealt with equitably within the alcoholic beverages industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Speaking of equity, I notice in recent days the fascinating paradox that the excise increase in the last Budget of about 2.5c on a schooner of beer caused quite a massive outcry in the brewing industry and in the hotel industry in particular. In fact, I notice last week a suggestion that the 3c a schooner decrease in the excise on low alcohol or light beer is in fact too small to pass on. In other words, it is not substantial enough to pass on to the consumer whereas the increase last year, which was slightly less, was in fact the cause of major concern and created a major outcry. I am most disappointed that the hotel industry has not seen fit to convey back to the consumer one of the benefits of the recent Budget, which is a positive incentive to try to reduce the alcohol content in liquor that is being consumed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We on this side of the House of course must express disappointment because any taxation revenue raising will not be easy for any government but that is no reason why we should run away from the issue. The amendments put forward in this legislation are in fact serious ones because they seek to remove anomalies in tax avoidance then produce an incentive for people to consume lower alcohol beer . They bring into the taxation area wine consumption, which is important. The Opposition has trumpeted its support for a consumption tax for a long time. This is a consumption tax. In that sense this tax is very equitable when compared with other taxation. When we bring a consumption tax forward the Opposition suddenly says: 'Hey, you should not-it is the wrong time'. Yet, we heard a 25- minute speech on how this Budget will increase the structural deficit and cause massive problems in the next Budget. But at the same time the Opposition opposes the introduction of an equitable consumption tax that in fact contributes to revenue. I find the contradictions most apparent and I do not doubt that the Australian public will find them equally apparent.

         —I was interested in the parallel that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) drew in relation to the question of the tax on wine and the desirability of it not being on the basis that the tax was desirable but simply because it was a new tax it was not a matter that the Government itself should run away from. Taking his analogy to its logical conclusion, one would equally expect him to be standing up in this place arguing in favour of a capital gains tax about which we hear from time to time, simply because it is a new tax and something that the Government should not be running away from. I suspect that because a capital gains tax is likely to affect far more people and is not a sectional tax in the way in which the wine tax is which is likely to impact in specific electorates, it will not be a course to which the honourable member will address himself at least before an election.

        Some comments were made by Government members who preceded me about the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). They have suggested that it was perhaps somewhat unusual that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition addressed himself to the wider budgetary references in his address tonight. I would simply say that if one looks at the Government's timetable for consideration of legislation one would appreciate why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have addressed himself to the wider budgetary implications of this legislation and other aspects of the Government's Budget because, quite frankly, considerable hours were to be allocated this week for discussion of the Appropriation Bills. It will be appreciated by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other honourable members that under the new program that has been submitted to us Budget Bills and other Bills are being brought in and the discussion of appropriation generally is not proceeding. The obvious implication from that is that the Government is desirous of getting its legislation through and is not providing for proper discussion of the Budget itself. The Government is doing this to facilitate its objective of getting to the polls with as little discussion as possible of the Budget and the important issues that are involved in it. I do not apologise and I am sure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not apologise for addressing the wider implications of the Budget in this opportunity to discuss the first Budget Bills that have been introduced by this Government.

        The legislation at which we are looking relates to what is known as broadly based indirect taxation. We are dealing with a number of sales tax Bills. I wish to address myself to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. That Bill covers a number of matters. It picks up some particular questions relating to the Government's new tax on wine. The only extent to which I will refer to the wine tax is simply to note that there was a time when the area that I represent claimed some credit in relation to wine growing. I was formerly the member for Parra- matta. We took great pride in the district. Parra - matta was the first place in which wine was grown in Australia.

         —It was the first place in which many things took place. Flight was one matter which was mentioned. There was also the matter of wheat. Many agricultural products were first grown in Parramatta. In my electorate of Dundas there is the very well known and highly regarded James Ruse Agricultural High School which is of great agricultural fame. The character of the electorate has changed over time, with the exception of the James Ruse school. We do not have the same grape growing or wheat growing industries. We have other industries. For that reason I will address myself to the sales tax implications of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act because it does impact upon my electorate and upon particular businesses that operate from my electorate. I hope that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Hurford), who is at the table, will take note of the points I intend to make in the short time allotted to me. I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will give consideration to amending further this Act of Parliament at the first available opportunity.

        The matter I raise concerns the plight of some 20 companies in Australia which manufacture souvenirs and stuffed toys with musical movements, particularly the koala. In item 43 of the second schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act we find that musical boxes and other goods incorporating musical movements are covered. Products falling into this category are taxable at the rate of 32.5 per cent. Yet similar items which do not have musical movements are taxed at the rate of 20 per cent. Historically, musical movements have always attracted the highest sales tax category there is. The musical movement component in the manufactured item is only a small part of the production cost of the finished article. Yet because the manufacturer seeks to make his product more attractive to the market he is penalised to the tune of an extra 12.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been told that seven companies in New South Wales are involved in this industry; two in South Australia; six in Victoria; three in Queensland and two in Western Australia. It is estimated that those companies employ directly some 2,000 people. That is certainly not a major industrial group, but nevertheless it is an important industry. In view of the emphasis that has been placed on the growth in tourism and ancillary services the manufacture of these items is an increasingly important industry. I hope that honourable members will take note of the state of this industry which estimates that its work force has probably halved over the last five years or so. The information I have is that this has occurred as a result of the way in which the industry has been discriminated against, as a result of the differential arrangement in the way in which the sales tax is levied on the koala, depending upon whether it has a musical component incorporated in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The industry would like to see items manufactured here, with or without musical components, attracting the same rate of tax. At a time of heightened national spirit, when all Australians are looking towards our bicentenary celebrations in 1988, surely it behoves the Government to look closely at this matter. Manufacturers are able to show that koalas which include a musical movement-I have some here which I will show honourable members-which play tunes such as Waltzing Matilda are definitely of more appeal to both local and overseas tourists than those without a musical movement. However, the additional cost resulting from the 12.5 per cent sales tax on the musical component puts them well behind in sales competitiveness. That is the reason their sales have dropped. There has been a reduction in the number of people involved in the manufacture of these novelties. Musical movements such as I have described are not manufactured in Australia. There is limited scope for the establishment of such production. Many of the koalas and similar items are hand made. Manufacturers estimate that between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of their costs are labour charges. Government action to alleviate the problem I have raised would certainly assist the manufacturers in stabilising employment prospects and security within the industry and should, therefore, appeal to a government which purports to be concerned about increasing unemployment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, I have with me a musical movement. Perhaps like the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Barry Jones) you can see that it is only a fairly small item. I am sorry that it is playing. I had not wound it deliberately. That item is covered. It can be incorporated fairly easily in a bear. As honourable members can see, the koala with the red ribbon is the one that has not had the component incorporated in it. The koala with the blue ribbon has had the musical component incorporated in it. The people who have the opportunity of making a choice would, I think, take the one that has a musical component in it if it could be incorporated for a lower price.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that the component costs about $1.36. If the manufacturer chooses to use that item in his production he increases the price of his koala. The koala with the blue ribbon would have a price of something of the order of $9 over the price of the koala with the red ribbon which does not have a musical component incorporated in it. In 1983 a size 8 koala without a musical component retailed at $22 while a koala with a musical component carrying the extra 12.5 per cent sales tax was priced at $29. For visitors to Australia who are on a budget the difference of $7 is considerable. Certainly it is enough to sway them to the cheaper product despite the fact that they would perhaps prefer the model with the musical component incorporated in it. I hope that the Government will review the differential pricing of these products. I hope that the sales tax can be levied at the same rate and not at a higher rate simply because one item has a musical component included in it.

If not that, I would have thought there would have been a discussion in general terms about the desirability or otherwise of an extension to the indirect tax base. That would have seemed to be the logical way for the debate to proceed given the current consideration of the whole issue of broadly based consumption taxes and so on. But we seem to have had a range of peculiar digressions, the last one being the most bizarre of all, when we had a discussion of soft toys with musical movements, which I thought might have been part of the Opposition's internal deliberations to find a new leader after the next election.

        The broad issues associated with the imposition of the new tax and its impact on the wine industry have been addressed. There has been some discussion about the effects that the introduction of this tax will have on the consumption and sale of wines. Again, I find it extraordinary that members of the Opposition, the overwhelming majority of whom would presumably want to put people in prison for consuming marihuana, are being so terribly upset about the introduction of a tax or an impost which they fear will bring about a reduction in the consumption of a product which, accordingly to all available medical evidence, is demonstrably more harmful to people's health than marihuana. It is an amazing and an astonishing double standard and one which will never cease to amaze me. In speaking on this legislation, I am in the fortunate position of not actually representing a wine producing electorate.

         —That is what I was saying; not that there are any of them in the Australian Labor Party in the Sydney electorate. This legislation is not a major part of the Government's budgetary processes or economic strategy. It represents a marginal extension of the indirect tax base, a new product brought within the ambit of the wholesale sales tax and some rationalisation of the rates at which taxes are levied on different forms of alcoholic beverage. There is a range of other provisions within these pieces of legislation, but I will talk about that in general terms.

        It is interesting to look at the whole issue of indirect tax. It is one illustration, I guess, of the extension of the indirect tax base where it is unclear what will be the effect on the equity of the overall tax system. The general presumption-and it is a presumption that is embodied in the prices and incomes accord, which is the centrepiece of this Government's economic approach- is that there is a general aversion to the idea of extending the indirect tax base. This matter, as I am sure most honourable members would be aware, was debated at the National Conference of the Party. The fear within the trade union movement is that a broad based consumption tax would reduce the overall equity of the tax system. When this issue is generally discussed it is normally couched in terms of a very broad based overhaul of the tax system that would include the introduction perhaps of a broad based consumption tax, along with some other forms of new taxes which aim to restore a degree of equity in the tax system which was lost by the introduction of a new type of indirect tax. That implies the introduction of taxes on capital gains, wealth or wealth transfers. That is the sort of broad issue that must be considered.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is unclear in this case what would be the effect of the introduction of a wine tax and whether it would impact mainly on those people who consume cask wine or those who consume bottled wine. Obviously, there is a significant differentiation between the sort of people who consume those two types of wine. It is unclear whether in effect one would be taxing a luxury good or a good with a widespread consumption. It is an interesting illustration of the point that extension of the indirect tax base is not necessarily a bad thing in equity terms.

        I will make some brief remarks about the contribution of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to this debate. Again, it was a contribution that seemed to pertain only in the most marginal sense to the actual substantial matters that are before the House. He took the opportunity to launch into a wide -ranging attack on the Government's macro-economic strategy as outlined in the Budget that was brought down two weeks ago. In some ways it was a little difficult to follow his argument. He seemed to talk about a number of different things. On the one hand he focused on the fact that estimates of the growth in real outlays, which are estimated to be 6.1 per cent in 1984-85, outstrip the projected real growth in the gross domestic product. Of course he ignored, as he did the other week in his question to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the fact that the introduction of Medicare is a one-off factor in which there has been the transfer of what was previously a private consumption expenditure to the public sector, which therefore produces a one-off boost in the size of outlays. If one is trying to draw any broad conclusions, that is not really valid. As the Treasurer pointed out at the time, if we take out the introduction of Medicare, the growth in the real outlays figure falls from 6.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent which is roughly in the same range as the growth in GDP, as projected in the Budget Papers. Even without doing that, we are looking at a marginal increase in outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product from 30.5 per cent to 31.1 per cent; in other words, a 0.6 per cent increase, a very marginal increase if we look at the proportions that apply to other comparable advanced countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It is not an exceptionally large figure. To draw some broad inference that disaster waits around the corner as a result of such growth is simply ludicrous.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seemed to hint at a quite separate point- that is, the issue of the deficit. He referred to the one-off boost in receipts arising from the very rapid growth in provisional tax receipts and so on, which is certainly true. That is a one-off factor. But it does not therefore follow that the problems with the Budget deficit will become intractable next year. What needs to be borne in mind is that hopefully the economy will continue to move closer to a full employment position over time. The projections that have been made about growth in output and employment growth suggest that that will happen. If that occurs, we can expect a continued decline in the so-called cyclical component of the Budget deficit. Hopefully, that would mean a reduction in the overall Budget deficit. Even though the very substantial receipts growth that we will see in this financial year might not be repeated in subsequent financial years, it does not necessarily follow that, taking all things into consideration, we will see a blowing out of the Budget deficit which, as I say, is a separate point from the first point made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also make the obvious point that the tax cuts that have been introduced do not entail any movement in the threshold areas in the tax scale. They also involve the introduction of a new 48 per cent band, which, assuming that inflation continues at some level, implies that the normal effects of the fiscal drag of people moving into higher tax brackets would result in the recoupment of some of that tax cut. Possibly, that is not the sort of thing that one should say. Nonetheless, if one is looking at the broad picture down the track, there is no particular reason to suppose that the problems associated with the Budget deficit will become intractable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will conclude at this point because we have been told to cut back our remarks so that the leg- islation will be passed tonight. I have canvassed some points relating both to the legislation and to some of the arguments and points that were put in the course of the debate. As I said, some of them bore only the most marginal relationship to the specific pieces of legislation that are before the House.

         —The Federal Government has said that it is committed to economic growth. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) promised on 20 February 1983, in a desperate bid to win a couple of federal electorates that 'Labor will not introduce a wine tax'. It is difficult to understand how it has allowed itself to be coerced by the brewing lobby, in a desperate attempt to raise money to pay for its high spending programs. This tax is an act of stupidity. In the near future it will be seen to be so. As with the infamous fortified wine tax which had to be removed because it was destroying the industry, so I believe will this tax.

        The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) earlier in the debate expressed concern about this tax and attempted to justify its implementation. I challenge them both to show their real concern for their electorates, to cross the floor and vote against this legislation. They have outstanding large and small boutique winemakers in their areas, but of course they will not cross the floor. They have signed their social manifesto. In the 12 years that I have been in this place I have yet to witness one member of the Australian Labor Party crossing the floor on any issue . Because of this they simply just cannot represent their electorates. Their electorates will be most severely affected by this tax as will the electorates of many members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Bendigo also mentioned an outstanding Australian product, that outstanding champagne, Great Western, but this legislation clearly indicates to me that the socialist Government members on the other side of the House much prefer Bollinger to Great Western. In my view they have certainly developed a preference for the French rather than for the Australian grown wines.

         —That is exactly right. I believe this legislation will have the effect of increasing the percentage of imported wines that are consumed in this country, wines which now have a 10 per cent advantage on our local product which they did not have prior to the Budget. Successive Federal governments have recognised the fragility of the entire wine industry for years and have avoided threatening its long term viability through taxation. One previous attempt to impose a similar tax on wine failed and was subsequently repealed. The 10 per cent sales tax will have an adverse effect on the industry at a time when it is faced with overproduction of grapes, intense competition and diminishing returns . The tax will severely reduce wine sales without promoting an increase in beer sales. It will threaten employment in the wine industry and will exacerbate the plight of grape growers. Of course, it will increase dumping of overseas wines especially from the European Economic Community wine lake.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This tax will result in a fall in consumption of an estimated 40 million litres of wine per annum, equivalent to the grape growers throughout Australia of some 50,000 tonnes of grapes. The honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) mentioned that this tax was only marginal. Of course it is only marginal to the 15 million consumers in Australia but it is not marginal for the few thousand grape growers who will have to pay up to $62m a year extra tax because of this measure. The grape growing industry, which the Industries Assistance Commission has identified as being in a disastrous state, will be placed in jeopardy. Average grape production in Australia amounts at present to some 800,000 tonnes of which up to 100,000 tonnes is already surplus production channelled into dried fruit production and presently exported at a massive loss. The only alternative use for these grapes is increased wine production, and this outlet will now be denied the grape growers of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Grape production in Australia is located in a number of decentralised rural communities and the economic hardship caused by the sales tax on wine will be disproportionately borne by these communities. The grape industry is a vital source of employment for some 7,300 people employed in the grape growing sector and for another 5,600 in wine production, with thousands more employed in distribution and retailing. The devastating consequences of any recession in the Australian wine industry will be felt more strongly in South Australia, Victoria , New South Wales and Western Australia. These States have defended a burgeoning industry against the selfish, short-sighted attacks of those who place their own needs above the long term stability of a valuable industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        This new wine tax, as I have said, is expected to cost the industry up to $62m in a full year. I am concerned that there will be a massive loss in production and a short fall in revenue to the Government. This will make the Government realise its stupidity, as it did with the ill-conceived fortified wine tax and it will be forced to reduce this severe impost. The decision to refund tax collected under the fortified wine tax had to be made or double taxation would have been imposed on the wine industry. We have now seen the Hawke Government in its two years in office introduce two taxation measures to the detriment of thousands of small grape growers. One does not have to believe members of the Opposition to see how disastrous the effect will be on the industry. I will quote from a letter that the Premier of South Australia has written to the Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating). The letter states:
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to express the deepest concern about the unexpected decision by the Federal Government to introduce a general sales tax of 10 per cent on wine.
       </para>
       <para>
        This decision will not only be regressive in terms of its effect on the industry but will have a discriminatory impact on South Australia and the regional economy of the Riverland in particular. These arguments have been put before and were reflected in your press statement of 22 June 1984, announcing the removal of the excise on grape spirit.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am astounded that the Federal Government could have made this decision given the arguments that have been put before it over the past twelve months in relation to this industry. Particular aspects of this tax that seem to have not been properly evaluated in making your decision are:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. The discriminatory impact on this State-

       <para>
        the Premier could have said 'on all wine growing areas of Australia'-
       </para>
       <para>
        which is likely to occur because of reduced Australian wine sales and hence grape intake following the 10 per cent sales tax impost. South Australia produces over half of the wine made in Australia and harvests more than half of wine grapes grown.
       </para>
       <para>
        2. In view of the well-authenticated existence of vast 'wine-lakes' in European Economic Community countries and their heavy subsidisation of wine exports, it is surprising to read at page 21 of your speech:
       </para>
       <para>
        'This reduction in protection is not expected to result in any significant increase in wine imports.'
       </para>
       <para>
        No one on this side of the House could have better put the effects on the grape growing industry as did the Labor Premier of South Australia. I believe the Government has compounded its stupidity, at the same time as it applied an impost, by announcing that an inquiry would be undertaken into the problems of the grape industry. I would have thought that an inquiry into the problems of the grape industry should have come before imposing the impost. Mr Deputy Speaker, I conclude simply by saying--

Mr Speaker, I conclude by saying that this Government should immediately introduce anti- dumping action against dried vine fruit, wine and spirit imports from the EEC. It should immediately introduce trading stock valuation adjustments for stocks of alcoholic beverages, particularly where they must be seen as the result of federal legislation, for example, the maturation of brandy. I believe the Government must immediately instigate a conference so that the local alcoholic beverage industry-wine, beer and spirits-can negotiate a rational and equitable tax policy both for domestic production and imports to include consideration of the imposition of State liquor taxes. What the grape growing industry in this country needs is a predictable policy. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has estimated that horticultural farm incomes in 1983-84 will fall from $209 to $153 per week.

          —A matter of great interest to me is why the Government wanted to impose this particular attack on the wine industry, principally, at a time when even by its own admission things are very difficult for that industry. Why is it necessary to go chasing after another $60m in wine tax when the Government will already have an increase in revenues from other tax sources of 8.6 thousand million dollars? Why was it necessary to do this irreparable harm to these people? I will not accept the argument of equity. There is no equity in what has been done to the beer industry; neither has there been much benefit.

People on this side of the House have said they approve of those statements; I believe they probably do approve of them. It is gross hypocrisy for these two Premiers who campaigned just recently to make such statements. In Western Australia there were bumper stickers saying 'Burke-Hawke'. The message was to Australian winegrowers, particularly the people of the Swan Valley, who changed their vote and voted out a Liberal candidate in the State election. They were told that all they had to do was to vote in Brian Burke and his great relationship with Bob Hawke would guarantee them all the things they wanted. Now Burke is whingeing to Bob Hawke.

         There is another issue that has not been touched on very greatly tonight. I am terribly disappointed that the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), has left the House. I believe she has a genuine interest in saving people's lives on the road. She has a complete and total lack of knowledge of what alcohol in beer means. The other day when I got up and attacked the Minister for Transport (Mr Peter Morris) when he sanctimoniously talked about the great interest that this Government has in road safety-he was, of course, referring to its penurious $2. 9m expenditure on road safety promotion-I asked him why it was necessary to increase the cost of low alcohol beer. He knows so little about it that he thought I was talking about the 3 per cent alcohol beer that this Government has reduced the excise on. Three per cent alcohol beer has a lower alcohol content than 5 per cent or 6 per cent alcohol beer which is the most popular drink in Australia. But the new beer produced, known as Swan Special Light, which is the subject of these Bills, and which is to be taxed at 20 per cent, is just below 1 per cent in alcohol content. That is achieved by a special process. The process is one of taking normal 5 per cent or 6 per cent alcohol beer and with the aid of a vacuum process evaporate the alcohol content. It is real beer. The honourable member for Lilley said the other day that it is not real beer. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, so stupidly said, 'It is not real beer; I refuse you the right to market it as beer'. The best thing in the world that could be achieved for Australia and the road toll is to convince every Australian not only that it is real beer, but also that they should all drink it . If they did drink it, as has been confirmed and is now publicly advertised, they would drown themselves in the stuff before they could achieve a 0.05 or a 0 .08 blood alcohol level. If anybody suggests that they could not do that with beer with a 3 per cent alcohol content, they should think again. It takes a little longer to get drunk, but one can still achieve all the criminal activity on the road with the aid of 3 per cent alcohol beer as one can with 5 per cent or 6 per cent alcohol beer.
        </para>
        <para>
         This Government has done two things; it has compounded the problem. It has reduced the price of a beer that can still cause danger on the roads and it has increased the price of a beer that does not cause such danger. The compounded problem is that the Government has created a financial disincentive of 10 cents a can, roughly 20 cents a large bottle, against drinking the product that would save lives on the road because it is impossible to drink it and be a drunk driver. But then, of course, Premier Wran--

          —Oh, yes. There is profit in this. There is $6m a year profit to the Government in this. Of course, out of that it is taking $2.9m for road safety promotion. We would not need road safety promotion in many respects if we could create circumstances where people had an acceptable drink on social occasions which did not affect their driving ability. That is what I am talking about with that particular beer. But as I said, the Premier of New South Wales would not even accept it. He would not have it declared a beer. He did not want people to want to drink it. He would rather that they drink 3 per cent beer so that he could send out his constables on to the roads because he has another great revenue component from the fines he can collect from some people who accidentally take that extra glass.

         So there is a real problem in this regard and one for which the Government can take equal blame. It can count the deaths on the road from here on in and claim a percentage for itself because that is what it will mean. I think this is a disastrous situation and one which shows completely the economic tunnel vision of the Government. It never thinks of the real costs. As a member of the Road Safety Committee I heard figures such as $200m a year thrown around as the real cost to the Australian people of road accidents. Of course, there are many costs there. I appreciate that this is all the time I have to speak tonight, but I think it was worth raising those few points.

         —I also rise to express my concern and the concern of all South Australian members on this side of the House about the effect that these taxes will have on the wine industry throughout Australia and particularly in South Australia. It should be remembered by the House that just before the last election the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said clearly and unequivocally in Griffith that he would not impose a sales tax on wine. I do not think that a statement could be much clearer, but despite that promise, the Government appeared to be determined to break its word and it did so in the first Labor Budget. In that Budget the Government imposed a tax on fortified spirit. The Opposition at the time warned of the disastrous consequences of that tax and when our warnings rang true the Government first reduced and then dropped the tax. Now, big heartedly, it says it will refund the revenue collected. The question I ask is when? Perhaps the Minister for Housing and Construction and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Hurford), who is at the table, in wrapping up the debate will give an indication of when that revenue will be refunded.

         —Indeed, as the honourable member for Wakefield rightly says, unfortunately for the wine industry this Government appears to have more than its fair share of slow learners. After the first sortie the wine industry is still feeling the effects of that tax. One would think that the Government could not be so foolhardy as to rush back into the chaos it had created and impose another tax at this time, but unfortunately for the wine industry that is not the case.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I refer to the timing of the imposition of this tax. What will be the effect on the wine industry? I refer to a document from the Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association which estimates lost sales to wine makers of 40 million litres per annum in the long term and reduced intake of grapes from grape growers of 65,000 tonnes which would result in lost income to grape growers of $ 15.6m per annum. That is the effect that the Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association believes this tax will have directly on wine growers and wine makers in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition the situation facing the dried vine fruits industry is very pessimistic with the prospect of surpluses and the loss of export markets. Not only is the industry faced with losing export markets, but now the opportunities to sell to wine producers have been killed off as a result of this Government's wine tax. The Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association's figures clearly show that wine producers will not be increasing their intake of grapes this year , but will be reducing it. The dried vine fruits industry is facing a very serious situation and, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said, has now had another door slammed in its face.
       </para>
       <para>
        The timing of this tax is even worse when one considers the plight of this industry, given the Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimate over the last two years that the real farm cash operating surplus for horticulturists has dropped from $290 a week to an estimate this year of $153 a week. The failure of this Government to appreciate the direct and indirect effect of this tax is horrifying. Not only is the timing disastrous, but also the tax itself, imposed on domestic wine producers and advantaging importers, is quite wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the tax will be that imported wine will continue to be landed at around the same price as before, while the price of Australian wine has been increased by 10 per cent. In the face of increasing dumped wine imports, the growing wine surpluses in the European Economic Community, the subsidised EEC production and the protection against competition in the EEC, the Government has moved to increase the competitive advantage of wine imports. This outrageous action highlights the Government's total failure to comprehend the consequences of its action. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) has admitted this discrimination against domestic producers. I quote from an article in the Australian Financial Review of 23 August which states:

         —It must have lost track of time. I wonder just what statements issuing out of the mouths of Ministers of this Government can be believed. Before the last election the Prime Minister said there would be no wine tax. Now we have seen the Government impose two wine taxes. The Minister for Primary Industry said before the election that there would be no wine tax. Subsequently he said if there were, the wine industry would be given five years notice. Obviously, Ministers of this Government cannot be trusted. Their word is not their bond.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister and the Government have not been so forthright about the consequences of their action, but the Budget Papers are more revealing. The Budget Papers forecast that the new Customs duty on imported wine will raise $3m this year and $4m in a full year. The same Customs duty on imported wine in 1982 -83 would have raised around $2.8m. The revenue increase therefore is from $2.8m to $4m for a full year. What does that indicate in relation to the expected imports of wine? Clearly it indicates that the Government believes there will be a 40 per cent increase in imports of wine as a result of the discriminatory action against local wine producers. The resulting reduction in domestic wine sales will hit hardest in the areas which can least afford it, for example, the Riverland in South Australia. The Government belatedly heeded the warnings of the Opposition and the industry in its previous attempts to tax this industry. It must act immediately to withdraw this untimely tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally I raise a matter of serious concern regarding the campaign suddenly launched before the Budget by the beer industry in favour of a tax on wine. Normally such a campaign would be launched in the formulative stages of the Budget. Why this year was it launched almost on election eve? One can only guess that it was a Government inspired campaign to soften up the electorate before the untimely tax was imposed. I repeat that the Government has broken its promise to the wine industry; it is up to its neck in skulduggery and for the sake of the thousands of people who will suffer as a result of this untimely tax , it must be repealed.

         —I appreciate that it is late in the evening and that I have been allowed a little time during this debate on the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills and cognate Bills. There have been many good contributions from both sides of the House. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) and others who have vast areas of vines within their electorate have indicated a great deal of sympathy for the plight of the wine grower today. I do not want to canvass the matters that have been canvassed so adequately by honourable members on both sides tonight other than to make a couple of points. The first point that I do not think anyone has raised is that the growing of vines for the production of wine is a primary industry. It involves planting and cultivating vines and nurturing them for five to seven years before full production is achieved. It is not like turning on the tap or the vat at the local brewery or soft drink factory. It is one of those primary industry areas in which something has to be grown for a number of years before full production is reached. To put a tax on wine is like putting a similar tax on beef, grain or lamb. Why do we not tax any of those primary industries that go through the same machinations to get to a production stage?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second point is that the important segment of quality wine production comes from the south of Western Australia-from Margaret River in the far south-west and the Plantagenet Shire in the lower Great Southern region. I have represented Margaret River since I entered the House in 1972. Plantagenet remains in the seat of O'Connor, though it is very much a part of the Albany region which I will once again represent after the next election. From the outset I must stress that the uncaring ignorance displayed by this Government affects not only the wine growers but also the whole local economies of the two major parts of the seat of Forrest. This can apply to any part of Australia too, and to the electorates of honourable members who have spoken tonight. Wine production in the south-west and Great Southern areas is very much a pioneer primary industry. Its relationship to large scale alcohol manufacture and hence to the rationale of the new 10 per cent sales tax is tenuous in the extreme.

        Less than 20 years ago, in 1965, the first vines were planted at Forest Hill and Plantagenet. The following year we saw in the Margaret River area the beginning of the Vasse Felix vineyard. The pioneers of the south west wine industry took a shrewd punt on the similarity of the climate with that of the Bordeaux area in France. The relative coolness of this part of the State assists in the development of quality wines. The record since 1966 has not disappointed those pioneers, despite problems with birds and other natural pests. Top international awards, for our chardonnays particularly, speak for themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wine growing is a relatively labour intensive industry which provides seasonal employment for many young people who otherwise might not find work. Moreover, it has become the focus of a growing tourist industry. Visits to celebrated wineries are often the highlight of trips to the south west. Other industries such as arts and crafts have been able to grow in tandem with this development. Of course tourist promotion by wineries is a means of boosting sales through tastings but a general impact on the local tourist industry must be acknowledged . As much as 15 per cent of profits, in other words 15 per cent of the quantity of wine a vineyard produces, can be used in that kind of promotion. When a sales tax of 10 per cent is imposed at the wholesale level and is thus levied on wines used in tasting, something has to give. If nothing else, if the Government persists with this tax it should consider lifting the tax on the 10 or 15 per cent of the product used by vineyards for wine tasting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wine tasting in my electorate has led to a vastly improved tourist industry in the area. This tax must concern all vineyards that have cellar sales and cater for tourists in this manner. The vast majority of the wine they use is reject wine. The bottles may be chipped at the top or something may have happened to them in the production process. There is nothing to do with such wine other than to dispose of it or use it for tasting. But under this wine tax, the wine used for those tastings will be taxed. I think that will be a great disincentive for wineries to be involved in that area. The effect on tourism will be swift should the wineries be forced to restrict or even cancel their tourist promotion activities, as some have already done in the Forrest electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a more general sense, a 10 per cent sales tax and price rise naturally has a greater relative impact on more expensive quality wines such as those produced in the seat of Forrest. The extra dollar on the price of a bottle of chardonnay could well dissuade the middle or lower income consumer. The extra 40c on the price of a cask of riesling will trouble him far less. The Hawke Government has wilfully ignored the estimate of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics that a 10 per cent price rise in the retail price of wine will cut sales by 5 to 7 per cent in the short term and by 13.5 per cent in the long term. Such an impact will fall more heavily on the small, quality winery. It will put many out of business. These percentage figures translate to a projected drop of over 41 million litres of domestic wine production for this financial year, affecting an industry with 12,000 jobs Australia-wide. The close relationship to tourism that I know to be so real in the south-west extends to other areas of Australia. The Hunter Valley is our top international tourist attraction. People do not go there to gaze at the coal. However, a few years of the Hawke wine tax might leave coal as the sole tourist attraction.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should not be thought for a moment that the 10 per cent sales tax on wine is the main concern of the coalition parties. The Hawke Government dealt its second major blow to the wine industry when it reduced the differential between Australian wines and imports. However the decision may be dressed up, the previous 20 per cent sales tax on foreign wines now becomes a duty of a mere 10 per cent, with both the imported and local product thereafter attracting the same 10 per cent sales tax. Protection is therefore cut by half. The Government correctly points out that under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade sales tax must not vary between imported and domestic products. It has not explained why it did not retain the existing protection by imposing a duty of 20 per cent rather than 10 per cent on imported wines.

I wish to correct this because in his speech he also implied that as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety I condoned support for a move which was against the interests of road users. What I said was that brewed drinks with less than one per cent alcohol, such as Export Light, were technically soft drinks tasting and looking like beer. I wish to make it clear that I encourage consumption of such drinks as an excellent and responsible alternative. They will still be priced competitively with soft drink and I encourage their consumption.

         —Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am trying to make that correction. As Chairman of that Committee, I make it clear that, regardless of this misrepresentation, I support the reduction of excise on light beer which has a higher alcohol content than Swan Special Light and Export Light but which is significantly lower than standard beer. The Federal Government's incentive to beer drinkers is a clear contravention--

         —in reply-In closing the debate, I thank all honourable members who took part for their contributions. There was one specific question from the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) about the refund of the tax on fortifying spirit. I can tell him that the necessary amendments have now been made to the Excise Regulations to allow these refunds to be paid to the persons due to receive them. They could submit their applications to the Collector of Customs in the State in which they have their business at any time from now on. We will seek to process those applications as quickly as possible. It must all be completed by 30 June 1985, so I hope that people will get their applications in quickly.

         —I am sure that they will. It will be a mark of the good faith of the Government that they will be paid as quickly as we can process those applications for refunds. I need only otherwise draw attention to the second reading amendment foreshadowed by the Opposition to the next Bill. I notice that the Opposition, in the wording of that amendment, has been very careful not to say that it is against the tax. It has drawn attention to the competitiveness with imported wine that has resulted from these changes. There is very good reason for this. A number of members of the Opposition, some in very influential positions, recognise that this tax was inevitable and that the sooner it was applied the sooner the necessary adjustments and restructuring in the wine industry would take place.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government is also very concerned about the competitiveness of the imported wine. We want to make absolutely certain that the industry readjusts so that it is competitive with those imports. We want to make sure that that will happen sooner rather than later. As a great trading nation we have to take notice of our obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which was one of the reasons why the measures turned out as they have. It limited our actions. However, we shall continue to monitor the situation very carefully and we will once again give all the encouragement and help we can to the restructuring so that the Australian wine will be competitive. We are confident that that will happen and that the wine industry will pursue the necessary actions to put its house in order so that it is competitive with imports. Of course, the Government will be opposing this foreshadowed amendment, which is mere rhetoric.

         —As time goes by it seems the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) and his Department are paying less attention to the need for an efficient and humane health service and occupying themselves more and more with the exciting and enjoyable game of worry-the-doctor. The word 'worry' in the name of the game carries two of its common meanings; that is, causing uncertainty and despondency, and snapping at and sinking teeth in whenever possible. The game is really great fun for a socialist Minister and, I must admit, has some enthusiastic spectators in the community. It is also true that some doctors deserve to be worried. But in the course of the game the Minister and his bureaucrats tend to forget their real job; that is, making sure that Australia has an efficient and humane health service. I shall instance one recent example of this.

        When a general practitioner refers a patient to a specialist there is a special form to be filled in. Without a properly completed referral form, Medicare will not pay its share of the bill for the specialist consultation. The requirements for the form are laid down in section 10 (2) of the Health Insurance Regulations . Unfortunately, the printed form supplied by the Department to general practitioners does not comply with the regulations. The form shows three things the general practitioner can ask the specialist for.

         —The first is an opinion, the second is immediate treatment and the third is continuing management of the present condition. On the same form below that appears the words: 'Strike out item(s) inapplicable'. The plain meaning of this is that a general practitioner can refer a patient to a specialist for any one, or any combination, of these courses of action. However, the regulations imply that the general practitioner must specify one and only one of them. The sensible approach would be to notify doctors of the discrepancy in the form and immediately set about changing either the forms or the regulations. In fact, it would be preferable to change the regulations for reasons I will come to in a moment.

        The Health Department's approach was to send in the Gestapo-that is the abbreviation for 'die gesundheitstaatspolizei'. These people raided the surgery of a constituent of mine who is a distinguished consultant surgeon. They left the impression that they were policemen, not just Health Department bureaucrats. They accused my constituent of medifraud for treating patients whose general practitioners had not literally struck out, by drawing a line through, two of the three options on the referral form. By this interpretation there would hardly be a single specialist in the country who has not committed medifraud and who is not liable, under the legislation, to five years gaol.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is worth a hundred points in the game of worry-the-doctor, but in real life it just shows up the stupidity of the system and the vindictiveness of the Minister and his Gestapo. Remember, the cause of the trouble is that the form and the regulations are not complementary. What is worse, if the regulations were strictly enforced, specialists would time and again have to decide whether to break the law or to deny patients proper treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        If a patient was sent for 'an opinion', and the opinion was that 'immediate treatment' was essential, the specialist could not give that treatment. He would have to send the patient back to the GP to be referred again to the specialist with a new referral form-if the patient lived that long. A patient sent to a cardiologist for 'an opinion' might have a heart attack in the consulting room. The consultant is allowed to save his life-in fact he is duty bound to save his life-but if he tries to get medical benefits for it, that is Medifraud.

         —The Australian International Eye Bank and Research Foundation-AIEBRF-has campaigned for eight years for a network of non- profit community based eye banks in Australia to provide corneal grafts. It is a charity registered in New South Wales and among the sponsors are Sir Douglas Nicholls, Kamahl, overseas identities and the founder-President, Mr Stanley Fitzroy-Mendis II, who is in the Gallery tonight, of the Medical Centre, 103 Young Street, Sydney. He has been occupied for 14 years as director of a family company in the United States of America and Australia which is active mainly in pathology laboratories registered with the Federal Government. He has donated some $60,000 of his family's resources over six years to promote the concept and has visited eye banks in most countries except the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China. He proposed last year a restaurant complex in Sydney to raise funds for eye banks and a venue for conferences. This was rejected for support as a community employment program project.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The then New South Wales Health Minister, Mr Brereton, offered to investigate the proposal on 24 November 1983 in a letter reference 83/7806 to Sir Douglas Nicholls, and there has been no further decision. Police are investigating records of 7,500 patients' eyes illegally removed after their death since 1956. The Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists was told by Sir Douglas on 7 December 1983 that the AIEBRF was renewing its appeal for support for the project. Previous responses from the Royal College were in effect to claim that there were already sufficient facilities. For example a letter to Mr Fitzroy- Mendis on 9 May 1978 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        There have already two excellent eye banks in existence in Sydney-one at Sydney Eye Hospital and the other at Lidcombe.
       </para>
       <para>
        An affidavit signed by Leslie Phillip Vorbach states that he worked as medical technician at Lidcombe from 1956 to 1978 and removed eyes at the morgue on directions of Drs Carter, Shirley Sarks, Scarf, Hooper and Hale and on request of eye doctors Hart, Hipwell, Gregory, Butcher, Williams, Selwar, Milverton, Pickering, Thompson, Shirley Sarks, Du Temple, King, Chabra, Ong, Kennedy, Professor Hollows, Bulman and Kappagoda. He sought no permission from any person other than the doctors concerned and believes no permission was obtained before his instructions. About 1,000 of the eyes, he states, were supplied to Dr Shirley Sarks who did research at Lidcombe. He supplied documents to Mr Fitzroy- Mendis and Professor Leo Landhuis, President of the Eye Banking Association of America, after the 1980 launching of the AIEBRF at the Wentworth Hotel in Sydney in 1980, and these documents were kept confidential until the failure of the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists to reply to the 7 December 1983 letter.
       </para>
       <para>
        On Sunday 27 May this year 60 Minutes produced the documentary evidence that eyes were illegally removed. Following this telecast, a phone call to 60 Minutes from a two-month previously retired technician of a teaching hospital in Sydney was to the effect that the illegal practice continues in all major hospitals. There is documentary evidence that two eye doctors, Roger McGuinness and N. Banks of Sydney, treated Mr Stanley Fitzroy-Mendis II with chlorocort for a mild follicular conjunctivitis after which his visual acuity was reduced so much that he was medically advised not to drive or write. An optometrist noted: 'Corneal surface deficiency'.
       </para>
       <para>
        A letter to the Medical Journal of Australia on 14 April 1984, at page 510, repeats a warning previously published in 1964 and 1982 against using chlorocort or its active ingredients and similar combinations of corticosteroids with antibiotics and calling for Federal action. The response of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is printed on the same page. Some derogatory allegations have been made in reference to the pending divorce of Mr Stanley Fitzroy-Mendis II. I have seen documentary evidence from independent specialists which leaves no doubt in my mind that these allegations are malicious defamation . In the light of the recent development of medifraud in many countries, one can only speculate on the motives of some doctors who have thrown suspicion on so many of their colleagues by participating in illegal practices which have been covered up by eminent eye specialists. The only offspring of Mr Stanley Fitzroy- Mendis II-

       My Department has insufficient evidence to support some of the claims made for these products. Companies are allowed to import negative ion generators into Australia provided no therapeutic claims are made regarding their use. The National Health and Medical Research Council at its 94th Session reiterated earlier recommendations adopted at the fifty-second and subsequent sessions, that:
      </para>
      <para>
       'the is no reliable evidence to indicate that negative ions promote health;
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       The attention of the Australian Publishers' Bureau has been drawn to my Department's views on the use of negative ion generators and it is unlikely that similar advertisements will be approved again in those newspapers which are members of the Media Council of Australia. In these circumstances I would not propose drawing the matter to the attention of the Trade Practices Commission.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) No. The Victorian Health Commission's Planning Division reported that in the period January to September 1982 Victorian children aged five and seven years had mean dif indices-deciduous teeth decayed, requiring extration or filled-of 2.83 and 3.56 respectively. These figures referred to children using both fluoridated and non-fluoridated water. The mean DMF indices-permanent teeth decayed, missing or filled-for children aged five and seven years were 0.02 and 0.71 respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Seven-year-old children at Ballarat, Victoria, were reported has having an average of 3.46 dif teeth. The Victorian Health Commission made no attempt to separate Ballarat children according to their use or non-use of fluoridated water. Some children living in non-fluoridated areas would have spent part of their lives in fluoridated areas, and vice versa.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The South Australian Health Commission has advised that in fluoridated areas in the first eight months of 1982, children required 0.97 hours of treatment by dental therapists compared with 1.15 hours in non-floridated areas. However, the Commission pointed out that in non-fluoridated areas dentists provided a great proportion of treatment than in fluoridated areas so that the difference in total treatment time would have been greater than stated above.
      </para>
      <para>
       Futhermore, the South Australian Health Commission has advised that the treatment time per patient was assessed by assigning time-units to each item of dental care. In fluoridated areas the average filling would tend to be smaller and require less time than in non-fluoridated areas. This method of assessment would tend to understate differences between the two groups.

       (2) Yes. However it was reported in the article that 78.6 per cent of children in northern Sydney in 1974 did not require teeth filled, compared with 8.1 per cent in 1961. The reasons for improved dental health were stated to be that ingestion and application of various types of fluoride, improved oral hygiene and diet, and more regular treatment.

      <para>
       (3) (a), (b), (c) It has not been possible to reconcile the statistics in the question with those presented in the article. However, the article reports that a considerable improvement in dental health took place before fluoridation of water in Sydney in 1968.

      <para>
       (4) The article concerning dental health of children in northern Sydney does not present information about mean DMF indices. It is understood that this information is not available. However, the article contains the following statement: 'The caries-free figure of 58 per cent in these northern suburbs in 1967 was equal to the figure obtained in Tamworth after nine years of fluoridation of water supplies'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) The National Health and Medical Research Council has not recommended fluoride supplements during pregnancy because they have not been shown to be effective in reducing dental caries of the child. I support this point of view.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The fluoride tablets marketed by Protea Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd contain 20 milligrams of sodium fluoride, and are for use in the treatment of osteoporosis and some other bone abnormalities. In view of the high fluoride content of the tablets they should not be used during pregnancy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The National Health and Medical Research Council examines new evidence and allegations concerning the use of fluorides in the control of dental caries.
      </para>

       In addition, my Department and other health authorities, including particularly the World Health Organisation maintain a close examination of the use of fluorides in the control of dental caries.

       Recommendations and pronouncements of the National Health and Medical Research Council are circulated widely in the reports of Council's Sessions.

      <para>
       (1) The Federal and State Governments and the tourism industry have joined forces in mounting a domestic campaign to encourage more Australians to see more of their country and to see it more often. The campaign is being co-ordinated by the Australian Tourist Commission and was launched nationally on 22 March. It consisted of a television commercial featuring Paul Hogan and a 100-page information and motivational booklet entitled 'Australian Made Holidays' published as a supplement to the April edition of the Australian Women's Weekly. So, 1.2 million copies of the booklet have been distributed in this way, with a further 800,000 copies being made available through travel sellers around Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Reaction to the Television commercial and the 'Australian Made Holidays' booklet has been very positive and there are real signs that the public is responding to the motivational thrust of the campaign. The level of inquiries to advertisers in the booklet is an indication of the high impact being achieved by the campaign.

      <para>
       (1) Yes, I am able to say some States did increase their budgets for tourism promotion in 1983-84. On the information I have, the increase in New South Wales is calculated at 95 per cent-that is, an increase from $1,023,000 to $2,000,000. These figures are for the allocation described as tourism promotion and advertising in the budget of the New South Wales Department of Leisure, Sport and Tourism.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes, the Australian Capital Territory tourism promotion budget has fallen in real terms by approximately 11 per cent; that is, the specific allocation to the Canberra Tourist Bureau which is operated by my Department. However, the promotion of tourism to the national capital is being fostered in a number of ways. The Government's decisions in respect of major national institutions such as the new Parliament House and the Museum of Australia and the approval of the hotel-convention centre have been taken consciously with the aim of focussing national and indeed international attention on Canberra. The Australian Capital Territory will also benefit from the Government's greatly increased support for our national tourism promotion body, the Australian Tourist Commission. The Commission's budget was almost doubled to $19.5m, for 1983-84. It is promoting the attractions of Australia with greater effect not only overseas but also, with the introduction of the Domestic Tourism Campaign in March this year, to Australians themselves. Canberra, now one of our major tourist destinations, must benefit from this. Finally, the Australian Capital Territory tourism industry has shown in recent times that by combining its forces it can achieve a significant voice for Canberra in the holidaying market. The Canberra Tourist Bureau, the Canberra Visitor and Convention Bureau-which also receives assistance from the Government-and other bodies representing elements of the industry through their concerted efforts have produced a steady, healthy visitor growth during the 80s.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. However, because of the neglect of the previous Government, we had to give priority to housing, welfare, and land servicing in the 1983-84 Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       At my direction, my Department has recently made a submission to the Public Service Board for an upgrading and reorganisation of its tourism administration, to enable it to meet the increasing demands placed on it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Improved road access to the Australian Capital Territory will be facilitated by the Australian bi-centennial roads development program. In respect of rail links , I draw the honourable member's attention to the introduction of XPT services to Canberra in August 1983. Upgraded airport facilities embracing improved passenger terminals, aircraft manoeuvring arrangements, and car parking facilities are also presently being investigated by the Department of Aviation.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) I understand that it is the case that a number of private banks in other countries have exposures in developing countries which exceed their capital bases. I am unable to comment on whether the private banks expect their lending to developing countries to be underwritten by developed Western bloc countries. Any such expectation would certainly appear to be dubious security. The current situation is that these banks, far from having their lending specificially underwritten by Western governments, have chosen to reschedule repayment obligations and, in conjunction with institutions such as the IMF, extend new loans (rather than to occasion default) to a number of developing countries experiencing difficulties in repaying external debt. I cannot offer any specific comment on what security the private banks have on these loans. However, presumably the main security for lending to governments and government agencies is represented by the credit rating and past performance of the governments concerned and the export-earning capacity of the borrowing countries .
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to short term borrowings from OPEC countries, it seems extremely unlikely that private banks would regard these borrowings as security against Third World borrowings given that they are not assets of Third World borrowers. In any case, OPEC deposits have represented only part of the supply of funds to international banks and, in aggregate, those deposits are now no longer increasing due to the substantial current account deficit of the oil exporting developing countries as a group.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) A number of the developing countries experiencing difficulties in servicing their external debts have borrowed funds from the International Monetary Fund. Most borrowings from the Fund are subject to economic policy conditions which are designed to restore the balance of payments and more general economic viability of the borrowing countries. With regard to any question of Third World citizens being 'squeezed into famine' to meet IMF lending conditions, there are three points which should be made:
      </para>
      <para>
       IMF lending has proved to be a catalyst for additional private bank lending;
      </para>
      <para>
       Without IMF loans, adjustment programs by countries experiencing severe debt servicing difficulties would have to be implemented over a far shorter period. This would usually involve a drastic cut in imports, the level of domestic economic activity and, as a consequence, living standards over the short term. In that sense, IMF loans can be regarded as easing the conditionality which would otherwise be imposed by the market;
      </para>
      <para>
       In many cases the need for balance of payments support from the IMF arises largely due to the inappropriate economic policies of the countries concerned. If IMF lending to such countries were unconditional it would merely postpone, rather than correct, a balance of payments crisis. At some later date, far more stringent adjustment policies, with even greater effects on living standards, would be necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I know of no basis for any suggestion that the IMF and World Bank take the approach of 'socialising losses and capitalising gains for private financiers'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question also raises the issue of relying on the Reserve Bank of Australia, rather than the IMF or World Bank, for future advances to meet international trade, aid and loan requirements. This suggests that the Bank could be regarded as an alternative to those international bodies for the provision of assistance by Australia to Third World countries. It is a view I would not accept.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government regards the IMF and World Bank as having pre-eminent roles in providing balance of payments support and longer term aid and fully supports their efforts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where balance of payments support is involved, Australia prefers the provision of such support to be multilateral, via institutions such as the IMF, rather than bilateral. Balance of payments support provided on a bilateral basis would:
      </para>
      <para>
       Normally require support by a number of countries and involve extensive coordination efforts amongst those countries. Such arrangements are difficult to put in place and frequently result in duplication of effort and greater inefficiencies;
      </para>
      <para>
       Tend to be politicised, rather than being provided on objective economic criteria as at present. This could be to the disadvantage of smaller and poorer countries; and
      </para>
      <para>
       Make it extremely difficult to apply appropriate economic policy conditions and to require adherence to agreed repayment schedules.
      </para>
      <para>
       The net effect of the bilateral provision of balance of payments support would therefore be to reduce the efficiency of the international monetary system. However, with respect to the provision of foreign aid it could be noted that Australia does provide about 74 per cent of its official development assistance on a bilateral basis. This mainly reflects our particular strategic, political and economic interests in the region. This aid is allocated through the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, in consultation with relevant departments. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, tabled the report of the high-level committee set up by the Government to review Australia's aid program on 7 June 1984. This report considers, inter alia, the desirable balance between bilateral and multilateral aid and the role of international agencies in the delivery of Australia's aid program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The meaning of this part of the question is unclear. I would draw the honourable member's attention, however, to the regular publications programs of both the IMF and the World Bank which explain the role of these institutions in assisting their member countries cope with current pressures. Particular publications of relevance include their respective annual reports, the IMF Survey (published fortnightly) and the quarterly Fund/Bank Journal, Finance and Development.

        asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 8 December 1983:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Can the Attorney-General say whether the Commissioner of Taxation is experiencing or anticipating problems in attempting to collect outstanding tax from large tax avoidance participants and promoters where the individuals have, over a period of time, divested themselves of income-earning assets and other assets to family trusts.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) If an individual organises his assets in this way can he still retain effective control over the trust assets by way of being (a) the appointor of the trust, (b) a shareholder and/or director of the trustee company, (c) the trustee of the trust or (d) named as guardian of the various beneficiaries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) If an individual goes bankrupt in this situation can the trustee of the bankrupt estate have recourse to any controlled assets where it could not be proved that the divesting was done with the specific intention of defrauding creditors.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Can a bankrupt be a beneficiary of a trust and simply request the trustee of the family trust to refrain from making any distributions of income to the bankrupt during the period of the bankruptcy; if so, is it possible for a bankrupt to have control over assets valued at many hundreds of thousands of dollars and have the income produced by these assets directed to other beneficiaries such as other family members, allowing the bankrupt to refrain from making payments to the creditors of the bankrupt estate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Have family trusts proliferated during recent years; if so, are any changes proposed to the Bankruptcy Act to ensure that interests in family trusts are available to creditors and particularly the Commissioner of Taxation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Can the Attorney-General say whether professional advisers have been advocating the method referred to in this question as a means of avoiding paying the Commissioner of Taxation if a tax scheme ultimately fails.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the 'West Australian' of 20 July 1983 alleging that in the bankrupt estate of a K. MacKenzie, an ear, nose, throat specialist, the Official Receiver accepted contributions of $1000 per month from an income of $160,000 per year; if so, does the Bankruptcy Act limit contributions in these cases to such a low level.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Is it a fact that a person who is bankrupt can maintain an extravagant lifestyle receiving amounts such as $160,000, less tax of approximately $86,000 and contributions of $12,000 to the estate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Are steps available to creditors to force the bankrupt-where the conditions of section 149 of the Bankruptcy Act have not been breached by the bankrupt-to make contributions to his estate for a longer period; if so, what steps.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Do present provisions of the Bankruptcy Act allow bankrupts with large incomes to remain bankrupt for only three years with the creditors receiving only minimal distributions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Is any action proposed to ensure that the apparent available abuses of the Bankruptcy Act are stopped; if so, what action.

        —The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that he has experienced problems, and anticipates problems in other cases, in collecting outstanding tax from tax avoidance participants where individuals have over a period of time divested themselves of assets to family trusts.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. It is possible for an individual to retain some control over assets transferred by that individual to a trust. The degree of control exercised by the individual in any given case will be determined by the provisions of the trust instrument.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. Section 120 of the Act enables the trustee to take action to set aside a settlement of property made within two years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, regardless of whether there is or is not an intention to defraud creditors. However some settlements, for example, settlements made in consideration of marriage, or a settlement upon a purchaser made in good faith and for valuable consideration, are exempted from the operation of the section. Certain other settlements made within five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, and not involving an intent to defraud, can also be set aside unless the parties to the settlement can prove that the settlor was at the time of making the settlement able to pay all his debts without the aid of the property settled and that the settlor's interest in the property passed to the donee upon execution of the settlement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Trusts known as discretionary trusts for maintenance are encountered occasionally by Official Receivers. If there is an absolute discretion in the trustees to apply the income for the maintenance of the bankrupt, his family or any of them in such manner as the trustees see fit, then the Court will not interfere with the bona fide exercise by the trustees of their discretionary power. If the arrangements involve a fraudulent disposition within the meaning of section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act, however, that section would apply and the fraudulent disposition would be void as against the trustee in bankruptcy. Section 120 of the Bankruptcy Act may also apply, and this is referred to in the response to part 3 of the question. Accordingly, the answer to the question is yes in that the trustees may, in certain circumstances, exercise their discretion to direct income away from a bankrupt beneficiary.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Bankruptcy administration does not maintain records of the kind which would be needed to answer the first part of the question. As to the second part of the question there are no proposals at this time to amend the Bankruptcy Act specifically to address the issue of family trust, but see the answer below to part 11 of the question.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Attorney-General is aware of one case involving possible collusion between a debtor and his financial advisor with a view to the concealment of assets from the debtor's creditors in a subsequent bankruptcy. The persons involved in this affair are the subject of proposed and pending proceedings, both of a criminal nature and of a civil nature, directed to recovery of the assets for the benefit of the creditors. The Attorney-General is not aware that such behaviour is a common practice. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised he has no evidence that professional advisers have been advocating arrangements for the predominant purpose of preventing recovery of debts by creditors. However, the Commissioner advises there are indications that this is at least a secondary consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Yes, the Attorney-General's attention has been drawn to the affairs of Dr K . I. MacKenzie who was declared bankrupt on 22 July 1980. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that he also is aware of the case.
      </para>
      <para>
       In that case the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Perth and another creditor made application under sub-section 149 (3) of the Bankruptcy Act to enter an objection to the discharge of the bankrupt from the bankruptcy. On 19 July 1983, Smith J. of the Supreme Court of Western Australia found that a prima facie case had been made out that the bankrupt was able or was likely, within five years from the date of the bankruptcy, to be able to make a significant contribution to his estate. Secondly, the conduct of the bankrupt in the period before his bankruptcy was unsatisfactory in that he had contributed to this bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculation. Thirdly, that within the period of six months immediately preceding the presentation of the petition upon which he became bankrupt, when unable to pay his debts as they became due, he gave an undue preference to some of his creditors. His Honour said that he was not seeking to make, nor did he make positive findings in relation to other allegations which would be fully dealt with when an application for discharge from bankruptcy is made. In the meantime, action is in train to seek a further contribution from the bankrupt's income to the trustee for the benefit of creditors under section 131 of the Bankruptcy Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       In response to the second limb of the question, the Bankruptcy Act does not ' limit contributions' to any particular level. Rather, the Act provides-by section 131-that subject to any order of the Court pursuant to sub-section 131 ( 2), a bankrupt who is in receipt of income is entitled to retain it for his own benefit. This provision is discussed in more detail in the response below question (8).
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The Bankruptcy Act provides that certain property of the bankrupt, styled ' divisible property', vests in the trustee in bankruptcy. The trustee then is obliged to realise the divisible property and distribute the proceeds amongst the creditors. The Act provides that, subject to any order of the Court pursuant to sub-section 131 (2) of the Act, a bankrupt who is in receipt of income is entitled to retain it for his own benefit.
      </para>
      <para>
       Case law has established that the level of contributions from income which is reasonable is a subjective assessment in each case. The amount of income which the bankrupt may retain for his own benefit is dependent on the bankrupt's occupation and station in life. Each case must therefore be considered on its own merits. Consequently the question of what is an 'extravagant lifestyle' is a question to be determined having regard to all the circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that it is his view that in a number of cases bankrupts have been able to maintain an extravagant lifestyle, paying what is considered to be a minimal contribution of income to the trustee for the benefit of creditors. In a number of such cases, the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt has been indemnified by the Commissioner to enable action to be taken to seek an increased contribution of income from the bankrupt under section 131 of the Bankruptcy Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) The effect of discharge from bankruptcy is to release the bankrupt from all provable debts, subject to certain specified exceptions, eg. a liability under the maintenance agreement or maintenance order. There is no power to compel a bankrupt to make contributions from income following discharge. In the event that the Court has made an order under sub-section 131 (2) appropriating portion of the bankrupt's income for the benefit of the creditors then such an order ceases to have effect upon the discharge of the bankrupt. This is provided for by sub-section 131 (5) of the Act. This provision was inserted as recently as 1980, by Act No. 12 of that year, in order to remove any doubt that may exist as to the law in this area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Historically, bankruptcy is based upon the distribution of the bankrupt's divisible property among his creditors. As mentioned in the answers to preceding questions, this source of money may, in limited circumstances, be supplemented by contributions from income. These circumstances are very limited as, subject to an order of the Court pursuant to sub-section 131 (2) of the Act, a bankrupt who is in receipt of income is entitled to retain it for his own benefit. Regarding discharge from bankruptcy, case law has made clear that it is the intention of the Bankruptcy Act that a bankrupt be entitled to automatic discharge from his bankruptcy after the expiration of 3 years from the date of his bankruptcy unless one or more of the four grounds specified in sub-section 149 (4) exists.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) As stated in answer to (5) above, there are no proposals at this time to amend the Bankruptcy Act specifically to address the issue of family trusts. However, the Commissioner of Taxation advises that he proposes to challenge arrangements of the kind referred to in the Question if he is so advised by Counsel. Accordingly consideration may need to be given to amendment of the Bankruptcy Act in the light of the outcome of these proposed challenges.

       (1) Telecom vacated Bona Vista, from an operational viewpoint, in June 1977 and a caretaker vacated the premises in about December 1978. The property was occupied by squatters from 4 September 1983 to 7 December 1983. The property has been sold recently by Telecom to a private purchaser.

       (2) The Minister for Housing and Construction has informed me that he is concerned to provide as much public housing as possible. As a first step, the Federal Government has substantially increased funds available for such housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister has written to the Minister for Administrative Services urging that suitable surplus Federal staff dwellings be allocated to public housing where practicable. It is understood, however, that there is limited scope for using such dwellings for this purpose. The stock of civil departments staff housing totals less than 3,000 nationwide, and much of it is in isolated locations. Surplus dwellings are identified and usually re-allocated fairly quickly. The Minister for Housing and Construction has also urged the State governments to ensure that surplus State owned dwellings are used for public housing where possible.

       The Department of Housing and Construction is represented on the inter- departmental committee on vacant servicemen's housing. Servicemen's dwellings owned by State housing authorities are returned to the States for use as public housing when the dwellings are no longer required by the Services.

       (1) During 1983, 537 female fiancees, who stated on arrival that their country of last residence was the Philippines, entered Australia as settlers. Both Australian citizens and permanent residents can sponsor fiancees, however, the numbers in each of these sponsorship groups are not separately identifiable.

      <para>
       The Department monitors the settlement experience of all migrant groups and adjusts and directs its services accordingly. For people from the Philippines support extends from specific counselling at the interview stage and in group sessions to printed information. My Department is also developing an audio- visual program aimed at alleviating settlement problems.

       The Department is also involved in the administration of the Consulting Services Feasibility Study Fund-CSFSF and the Technical Support Facility-TSF. The purpose of the CSFSF is to assist with the development of the export of services provided by Australian consultants. It is designed to assist Australian consultants in the preparatory stage of development projects in developing countries by the provision of funds for pre-feasibility or feasibility studies which can be used for an application for the funding from other sources for the further stages of the project. It is expected that the involvement of an Australian consultant in the early stages of the formulation of a development project will enable that consultant to gain exposure, knowledge and a 'track record' in a developing country.

       The Technical Support Facility has been created to enable Australia to react positively to requests on a Government-to- government level for assistance in providing experts to advise and formulate development projects in areas in the Middle East where Australian expertise and experience are perceived to be relevant to national development programs. An important objective of the TSF is to ensure Australia's future ability to respond in a way which will not only facilitate the development of closer relations with these important oil exporting countries, but which would also ensure Australia is well placed to take advantage of the valuable commercial opportunities which exist in these countries for consultants, contractors and equipment suppliers but which are not being fully exploited by Australia at present.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Points (1) to (6) No consultants have been engaged to work for me since 1 April 1983. The first column lists the consultants who have been engaged to work for the Department of Administrative Services since 1 April 1983. The second column indicates, as appropriate, in man days the period for which each consultant was engaged. With regard to the Australian Survey Office, consultants are selected from a panel period contract and work is done on a fixed price basis irrespective of the number of man days involved. The third column lists the fees paid and the fourth column provides information on the background and experience of each consultant. The final column notes the basis on which each consultant was engaged.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consultants engaged by the Department of Administrative Services are generally selected in accordance with guidelines issued by the Public Service Board for the engagement of consultants.
      </para>
      <para>
       Owing to the large number of consultants engaged by the Australian Survey Office their selection procedures have been standardised. The selection of consultants is based on the Survey Office's 'Procedures for Engaging Contractors for Surveying Services'. Details of these procedures are as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Firstly, all contractors who fulfil certain conditions and apply for inclusion are placed on a panel period contract.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where projects are under the public tender threshold the primary selection criteria is the availability of contractors who can provide satisfactory service in a particular geographical region. Contractors are placed on lists, in order of tender number, for each region. These contractors are then approached in turn with offers of work. This ensures that over a period all contractors are given the opportunity to carry out work for the Survey Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       For projects over the public tender threshold firms on the panel of contractors are invited to submit a quotation if they have the necessary resources and facilities to carry out the project concerned. Details of these resources are provided with the initial application for inclusion on the panel of contractors. Factors considered include: size; preferred working area; technological capabilities; previous record in terms of work standard and proven ability to meet target dates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Tenders are evaluated using the 'weighted scoring' technique to determine which tender offers the best value for money. Consultants are rated against certain criteria such as ability to meet target dates, performance and experience. Weights, which are dependent on the particular critical requirements of the project, are then applied to these criteria to determine the lowest effective cost. In all cases the weights are established and placed on file before tenders are let.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consultants engaged by the Australian Survey Office of the Department of Administrative Services are approved by the Public Service Board and it has now been established that this approval can be anticipated following approvals during the Budget process.

      <para>
       (1) I am advised that the Civic Library, Canberra City, recommenced Saturday opening from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on 9 June 1984. Prior to that, problems associated with the air-conditioning system caused great discomfort to both the staff and users of the library. An approach was made by my Department to the Department of Administrative Services to operate the air-conditioning on Saturdays and, as a result, the situation was rectified.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Library staff are willing to work on Saturday providing the air- conditioning functions at a satisfactory level.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Some complaints about the closure of the Civic Library has been received. It should be noted, however, that the other libraries operated by the Canberra Public Library Service have been open on Saturdays as follows:

       Belconnen 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Dickson 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Kingston 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Erindale Centre 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Woden Town Centre 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Kippax Interim Library 9 a. m.-1 p.m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) One case of a blind child who needed more lengthy access to the library on Saturday has been drawn to the attention of my Department. This is the only known complaint involving a blind person.

       (1) Will the Attorney-General take steps, as a matter of urgency, to investigate and have referred to the Ministerial Council the financial loss and hardship inflicted upon insureds with loss-based claims flowing from the collapse of the Bishopsgate Insurance Company.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Has the Attorney-General's attention been drawn to (a) recent Press reports of the findings of the liquidator into this company, (b) the decision of Mr Justice Needham in the New South Wales Supreme Court in the case of the Dominion Insurance Company of Australia and the Companies Act-Australian Law Reform Commission, Report No. 20, page 212-and the effect of this decision on the problems facing the liquidator, and (c) Press reports that this decision is being challenged by the liquidator of the company in the Victorian Supreme Court .

       (6) Is it a fact that the terms of the agreement setting up the Co-operative Companies and Securities Codes, do not affect the exercise of the powers to legislate on insurance and bankruptcy matters in conformity with the Constitution without the need to seek the approval of the Ministerial Council; if so, will the Attorney-General give urgent consideration to the enactment of legislation to give insureds with loss-based claims priority over all unsecured creditors; if not, will he refer to the Ministerial Council my private Member's Bill for the 'Winding up of Insurance Companies' for its urgent consideration and implementation, notwithstanding the reference to the ALRC on insolvency.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) In view of the exceptional nature of this case as reported in an article headed 'Bishopgate's Trail of ruined Lives' in the Australian of 17 February 1984, and in the light of the economic disaster needlessly inflicted on people because of this collapse, will the Attorney-General take immediate action to see what legislative amendments can be made to empower the liquidator to take steps to mitigate the suffering being inflicted on the insureds.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) and (6) There appears to be two alternative options which the Government could adopt to give greater financial protection to policy holders in the event of the failure of a general insurance company. The first involves the establishment of a guarantee fund to minimise losses to policy holders, as was recommended in the Law Reform Commission Report on Insurance Contracts ALRC 20. The Treasurer has this proposal under consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second, more limited approach, which is contained in the honourable member' s proposed Bill, is to accord a priority to policy holders' claims over the claims of other unsecured creditors in the winding up of a general insurance company. Depending on the outcome of the Treasurer's consideration of the Law Reform Commission's guarantee fund proposal, it may be appropriate for the Government to consider the more limited option of giving a preference to policy holder creditors in the winding up of a general insurance company.
      </para>
      <para>
       As to the method by which the latter proposal could be implemented, regard must plainly be had to the fact that the Commonwealth is party to the formal Agreement with the States, and it would be inappropriate to deal with matters which fall within the Agreement other than in accordance with its provisions. Any proposal which would vary the priorities which are to apply to the winding up of a company is covered by that Agreement and the Commonwealth would be required, in fulfilling its obligations under clause 46 of the Agreement, to raise the matter with the Ministerial Council. Should that take place, I would arrange for the honourable member's Bill to be taken into account by the Ministerial Council in the course of its examination of the matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a), (b) and (c) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) to (5) With regard to the question of the availability of re-insurance proceeds, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the actual decision of Mr Justice Needham in the Dominion Insurance Case. However, the Ministerial Council currently has under consideration proposals which would make specific provision for the distribution of re-insurance proceeds in the event of the winding up of an insurance company. At its meeting on 24 May 1984, the Ministerial Council agreed that the draft amendments should be referred for comment to the General Insurance Consultative Committee, a body whose members are appointed by the Treasurer to provide advice to the Government on matters relevant to current or prospective insurance legislation and on government policy proposals with significant implications for the insurance industry. The Ministerial Council will further consider the proposed legislative amendments after the consultations with the General Insurance Consultative Committee have been completed.

       (7) I am aware of the hardship that has been caused, not only to the policy holders, but also to the other unsecured creditors by the failure of the Bishopsgate group. As I have indicated, the Government is examining the case for legislative amendment to apply to any future insurance company failures. However , it would not be appropriate to intervene in the current liquidation of these companies by introducing legislative amendments which would, where there are necessarily limited assets available for distribution, have the effect of retrospectively increasing the entitlements of one group of creditors at the expense of reducing those of another group.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The 1983-84 budget handed down in August 1983 included an appropriation of $288.832m for the ABC. This figure was based on prices current at that time. The relevant figure for 1982-83 was $274.175m.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subsequently, as part of the additional estimates process, the ABC sought an additional $19.87m. Negotiations resulted in an eventual agreement for an additional $12.5m.
      </para>
      <para>
       The total 1983-84 appropriation for the ABC is therefore $301.332m or an increase of $27.157m which represents a 9.9 per cent increase on the 1982-83 figure.

However, I am advised by the AFP that the premises known as 'Pine Lodge' were known to the former Australian Capital Territory Police. Records of that force contain two reports concerning illegal activities associated with that establishment during its period of operation between April 1978 and July 1979-a complaint received by the then Minister for the Capital Territory from the Canberra South Branch of the Australian Labor Party that the premises were being used as a common gaming house, and an alleged attempt to bribe a member of the police.

       Warrants were issued by the AFP for the three who failed to appear and two are still current. The third was executed on 30.10.81. In the latter case, the Court found there was no case to answer and the matter was dismissed. In regard to the attempt to bribe a police officer, the then proprietor of Pine Lodge was charged by the former Australian Capital Police between 23 November 1978 and 15 December 1978 with allegedly offering a bribe of $2,000 per month to a member of the Licensing Squad to allow a roulette wheel to be installed in the premises. The matter was not finalised due to the principal prosecution witness being medically discharged from the force. On 18 September 1979 the Crown offered no evidence and was ordered to pay the defendant's costs of $400.

        —The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Companies Act 1981-the Act-does not provide that a person will be prohibited from acting as a director of a corporation for the reason only that he has been charged with committing an offence. I have indicated previously in my answer to part 2 (c) of your question No. 476 (see Hansard, 28 February 1984, page 92), that section 227 of the Act does not prohibit a person from acting as a director on the grounds that he has committed an offence unless that person has been convicted.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since I gave that reply, the enactment of new section 227A has extended the scope of the prohibition beyond the need to obtain a conviction. That section provides that an application may be made to the Supreme Court of a State or Territory for an order prohibiting a director, secretary or principal executive officer of a corporation from taking part in the management of a corporation where the person has acted dishonestly or carelessly in the performance of his duties, or where he has himself repeatedly breached, or has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the corporation from repeatedly breaching companies and securities legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should also point out that the Act contains other prohibitions on persons acting as directors for conduct not connected with the commission of an offence. By virtue of section 562 such a disqualification may be imposed by a Supreme Court where the person has taken part in the management of several failed companies where the manner in which the affairs of the companies were managed was responsible for their failure. Proposed amendments contained in the exposure draft of the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No . 2) Bill 1984, which have been released for public comment, will also enable the National Companies and Securities Commission to prohibit the common director of a number of failed companies from taking part in the management of a corporation without the leave of a Supreme Court.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I have noted the honourable member's views. However, as I have indicated, the Act already to a considerable extent gives effect to the view that persons who have demonstrated their unsuitability or incapacity to take part in the management of a company should be disqualified from acting as directors. I would not propose extending the prohibition further on the sole ground that a person has been charged with an offence. There are fundamental questions concerning the presumption of innocence involved in the imposition of such an unqualified restriction on a person.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Section 574 is not directed to the question of whether or not a charge has been laid against a person, or to the involvement of a charged person in the affairs of a company generally. Under the section, the NCSC may seek an injunction, among other things, to restrain a person from engaging in conduct which constitutes an offence against the Companies Act.

       (1) The Interim Committee of the Australian Sports Commission was established to advise the Government on the possible role, structure and function of the proposed Commission. The issue of the development of a sports museum was one of a number of specific issues that I asked the Interim Committee to address in the context of their overall recommendations. The Interim Committee has completed its report, and the recommendations are currently being considered by the Government. Until the Government has announced its decisions on the recommendations, I do not believe it is appropriate to discuss specific issues or recommendations out of context.

       I have already indicated my personal support for the concept of a sports museum which I believe would provide a fitting repository for all the artefacts and memorabilia that exist from Australia's sporting heroes and heroines. I will announce any specific initiatives to develop the concept further at the earliest possible time.

      <para>
       (1) and (2) At present telephone subscribers in Batemans Bay are serviced by portable exchanges which are nearing full capacity and trunk line outlets are sometimes congested during peak business periods. Telecom adopts a policy of encouraging customers to make social calls during off-peak periods whenever possible to leave equipment free for business calls during business hours. For this purpose, Telecom offers cheaper off-peak call charges.
      </para>
      <para>
       Work has started on the installation of a new exchange, at a cost of $1.35m, in the permanent building which was erected some years ago in anticipation of this requirement. The new exchange will be commissioned by the end of November 1984. In addition, Telecom has commenced network up-grading work to improve access from Batemans Bay to the trunk network. Because of delays in the supply of equipment, the up-grading work is not proceeding as quickly as originally scheduled, but it is being implemented progressively as equipment becomes available and will also be virtually completed by the end of November.
      </para>

      <para>
       (1) The Department of Social Security does not have a formal Equal Employment Opportunity-EEO-Program at present. To date EEO objectives and activities have been undertaken as part of the Department's ongoing programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       In order to provide a focus for equal opportunity activities, the Department in early 1984 sought approval from the Public Service Board for the creation of a Branch for this purpose. The Public Service Board gave approval for the Branch in June and a recruitment process for the Branch Head position, (an Assistant Director-General Level 1), and for an EEO Co-ordinator at the Director, Class 11 level, is in train. A first task of these positions will be the oversight and development of an Equal Employment Opportunity Program for the Department as required by the Public Service Reform Act 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Equal employment opportunity practices are an integral part of the ongoing activities of the Department and their cost is not known. Some costs will be identifiable once the Branch Head position referred to in (1) has been filled and specific EEO programs developed.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) In 1984 a draft equal employment opportunity EEO management plan was produced to outline the ways in which the Department would take steps to eradicate discrimination and promote equality in employment. This plan is currently being circulated widely amongst staff and staff associations for comment. It represents a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach to EEO in the Department. The final version of this plan will be produced following this consultation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The proposed strategies and objectives contained within the draft EEO management plan specify target groups, action required, responsibility, target dates and evaluation procedures. In addition a statistical data base is to be established against which objectives can be assessed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Significant mechanisms have been established to ensure that the aims of the EEO program are met. These include the establishment of Departmental, National and State EEO advisory committees and the designation of EEO co-ordinators across the Department. The Deputy Secretary of the Department is the director of EEO and an EEO unit has been established. Staff at all levels have also been consulted on the aims and objectives of the program and their views will be incorporated into the final EEO management plan.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) An EEO committee consisting of departmental staff Association representatives has been established. This committee will ensure that the views of staff associations are fully considered in EEO policy development and implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) The Public Service Board EEO Bureau has been fully consulted on all aspects of the Department's EEO activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) The EEO initiatives have been accorded high priority by the Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Cost
      </para>
      <para>
       It is expected that most EEO Strategies will amend systems and procedures and develop practices capable of being carried out within existing staffing resources. However, some additional costs have been identified. These specific costs which can be identified are estimated to be as follows for the 1984-85 financial year:

      </para>
      <para>
       Total  97,000
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 1983-84 financial year the EEO unit costs were approximately $55,000. The above costs do not include items such as telephones, photocopying and other administrative items which are included in general Department appropriations and for which the EEO component cannot be readily identified.

       (1) (a) My Department has issued a policy paper stating that all people employed by or seeking employment with the Department should have equal opportunity to be selected, and receive equitable treatment in all employment related issues. The policy objective includes the removal of discriminatory barriers against particular groups or individuals, the provision of special programs to overcome problems faced by disadvantaged groups, and the creation of a working environment and employment practices in which all employees are treated equitably.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) An interim Equal Employment Opportunities Committee was established to consider interim policies and procedures. following the report put out by this committee my Department has issued an EEO Policy statement. An equal opportunities sub-section has also been established, and is staffed by Clerk Class 9 and a Clerk Class 8 officer.

Following an exchange of correspondence, the Prime Minister advised Mr Everingham in a letter dated 17 May 1984 of the Government's concern that the two Territories should receive proper Parliamentary representation at an early date. The Prime Minister said that, because of constitutional difficulties with linking the Territories to an existing State, and because the Australian Capital Territory was clearly inappropriate on the grounds of remoteness and lack of community of interest, it had been decided to link both territories with the Northern Territory.

      <para>
       The Tribunal released on 2 April 1984, its report and determination in respect of the children's television standards. This report contains a detailed explanation of the criteria for 'C' classified programs. The criteria, substantially the same as those published by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in May 1979, are set out below:
      </para>
      <para>
       A 'C' program is one which:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) is designed specifically for children older than five years and younger than 14 years,
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (c) is well produced technically and artistically,
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) can be easily understood and appreciated by children,
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) fulfils some special need of children,

      <para>
       (f) contributes to the social, emotional or intellectual development of children,
      </para>
      <para>
       (g) is appropriate for Australian children, not assuming too much of the culture, dialect or environment of some other country, and
      </para>
      <para>
       (h) is not outdated in content or in technical or artistic production.
      </para>
      <para>
       A provisional classification may be awarded where material at the concept script development stage is submitted to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for assessment. Children's Television Standard 10 sets out the proposed new provisional classification arrangements, which are similar to those applying at present. The purpose of those arrangements is to give guidance to producers at the earliest possible stage, to prevent waste of funds or effort. For most children's programs, a provisional classification is made on the basis of a written proposal accompanied by a pilot episode or a videotape indicating the nature of the program.
      </para>
      <para>
       The provisional classification may be awarded for three months or for a longer period as determined by the Tribunal member delegated to determine applications on the basis of the prevailing production circumstances and following advice from the Children's Program Committee. In the event of the delegated member not classifying the program there is a right of review to the full Tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, the Committee regularly meets with the program producers to assist them in understanding the requirements and their application to programs they are developing. The program producer may at any time before the expiry of the provisional classification submit the completed program-or representative sample episodes-for a full 'C' classification. The provisional 'C' concept is designed to assist producers in being able to ensure that programs they are developing ultimately meet the 'C' classification requirements.

       The Commission wishes to commend the parties for the efforts which have obviously gone into the construction of the document and settlement of some severe outstanding industrial problems. The achievement of the parties by way of conciliation is consistent with the emphasis and responsibility placed on parties by this member of the Commission; the parties are accordingly asked to receive the Commission's appreciation of their efforts and to convey to their principals the approval of the Commission of the actions of the parties which have brought about this settlement and the express hopes of the Commission that this example may lead to similar action in other somewhat troubled areas. It connotes a high degree of improvement of industrial relations between the parties and the Commission expressly commends the parties for this reason.

      <para>
       (1) Successive Australian governments have expressed their deep concern with the human tragedy which has taken place in Lebanon since the outbreak of civil war in 1975 and have urged all parties involved in the fighting to seek a negotiated settlement. Both the previous and present Governments have made significant contributions towards assisting the reconstruction of Lebanon and providing humanitarian assistance to the people affected by the war.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The reconciliation talks in Lausanne formed part of a difficult and lengthy process towards a peaceful settlement. They were followed in May by the formation of a Government of National Unity under Prime Minister Karami which contains the leaders from all the major Lebanese factions. The Government of National Unity has agreed on the implementation of new security arrangements within Beirut and has made progress towards the reconciliation of political differences among the various factions. The visit of the Vice President of Syria , Mr Khaddam to Beirut on 18 June was a significant step in helping to achieve agreement on the proposed security arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Government has consistently called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces in Lebanon which are not there at the express request of the Lebanese Government. We believe that the actions of some external groups have exacerbated the internal conflict within Lebanon and that the Lebanese people should be free from such outside interference and that the sovereignty of the Lebanese Government should be restored over the whole of Lebanon.

The Minister for Health may also specify a standard in relation to goods for therapeutic use by reference to other publications, including a publication by the Standards Association of Australia, or by determining a standard for specific goods. In this regard a number of Australian standards have been published as Therapeutic Goods Orders but to date the emphasis has been given to pharmaceutical type products.

       (4) My Department currently monitors hazard alerts on medical devices from a number of overseas sources and co-ordinates recalls if indicated.

      <para>
       It is the eighth satellite launched in the Intelsat V series. Six of the eight were launched from the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in the United States of America, and two have been launched by the European Space Agency which launches from the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou in French Guiana. Intelsat V (F- 8) will form part of the total system of 15 Intelsat satellites which collectively provide communications for virtually all of the countries of the world.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The size of the payload which can be placed into a geostationary orbit by a given launch vehicle is higher for launch sites which are closer to the Equator.
      </para>
      <para>
       Information published by Arianespace, the organisation which controls launch operations at the Guiana Space Centre, states that the payload for a given launch vehicle placing a satellite into a geostationary orbit would be about 14 per cent greater for a launch from the Guiana Space Centre-located at 5* North Latitude-than the payload if the same launch vehicle were used from the Kennedy Space Centre-located at 28* North Latitude. Payload, however, also depends on launch vehicle design and overall National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which launches satellites from the Kennedy Space Centre, currently has the ability to place greater payloads in a geostationary orbit than the European Space Agency launching from the Guiana Space Centre.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Australia is a founding member and strong supporter of Intelsat, an international organisation which has been in operation since 1964 to provide a global commercial telecommunications satellite system to which all countries- members and non-members alike-would have access. The advantages of such a system have been widely recognised and 108 countries are now members. Of particular importance to Australia and neighbouring countries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans is that Intelsat provides affordable access to all users by rate averaging thin and heavy routes. Intelsat also recently approved a 'low density' satellite service-designated 'Vista'-which has been developed with a view to meeting the communications needs of remote communities-especially in Pacific island groups. Intelsat thus provides an excellent satellite communications service to both Australia and countries in the region.

As the distribution of the disease in New Zealand is not known, this effectively prohibits the importation of New Zealand apples.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Study areas were approximately delineated in locations agreed with the New South Wales Government, of sufficient size to allow consideration of options for siting particular elements of the proposed training area, for example, impact areas. In the case of Bathurst-Orange, the study area was over double the approximate area indicated for Army's 'Schools Complex'-that is, 160,000 hectares. Basic statistics about the study areas as such, for example, numbers of householders, have not been compiled, essentially because they would have no relevance to assessing effects of establishing the Schools Complex.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2), (3) A consultant has been tasked to recommend a potential site for a schools complex, in one of the three locations agreed with the New South Wales Government, which:
      </para>
      <para>
       is sparsely populated;
      </para>
      <para>
       has low economic potential;
      </para>
      <para>
       contains no, or few places of ecological or historic importance;
      </para>
      <para>
       would satisfy Army's location , terrain and vegetation requirements; and
      </para>
      <para>
       would, with appropriate land management, be able to sustain continuous training activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am not prepared at this stage to prejudge issues which the consultant's report is expected to address.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) Grazing leases have been authorised in parts of other military training areas, for example at Puckapunyal, Victoria, where this is practicable and consistent with their military use. Leasing arrangements are managed for the Commonwealth by the Chief Property Officer, Department of Administrative Services in the State where the military training occurs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Commonwealth recognises a responsibility in certain circumstances to contribute to the maintenance of access roads and associated local infrastructure not under its control, which are used by Defence or other Commonwealth traffic. The Commonwealth provides funds to local government for the nominated roads, to cover additional costs due to wear caused by Defence vehicles.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) My Department has been offered two properties from within the present ATFP study areas and two from outside these study areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) I have no knowledge of banks withdrawing finance to property owners as a result of areas being designated for study. As the Commonwealth is obliged under the Constitution to provide just compensation for any assets it acquires, it is not clear why finance would be withdrawn for such reasons.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) For Defence or other Commonwealth property, the Commonwealth recognises claims by local government authorities for payments equivalent to local rates for services rendered exclusively by the rating authority, such as water, sewerage, electricity or garbage services. These procedures also cover general rates where: the Commonwealth's tenant or lessee contributes as part of a rental an amount deemed to be in lieu of rates; or, the property is used by the Commonwealth or a Statutory Authority as a commercial enterprise; or, the Commonwealth is recovering-in whole or in part-its costs of providing the facilities and services in respect of the property; or, where the property is used solely to domestic purposes. Consideration is also given on a case by case basis to claims which do not strictly meet the above criteria and to appeals by local government authorities against the Commonwealth's initial determinations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The Singleton Shire Council has requested that the Army remain in Singleton . The Council expressed concern that any reduction of Service personnel would have a detrimental impact on the Singleton regional economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) the New South Wales Government continues to support the ATFP studies.
      </para>

       (9) Dames and Moore intend to assess the impact of the proposal on the superfine wool industry in the study region by evaluating the effect which alternative location options would have on the value of wool produced.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Support for the continuation of ATFP studies in the Bathurst-Orange has been expressed by the Bathurst-Orange Development Corporation, the Orange City Council, the Bathurst City Council and Army Base Support Group Orange.

       Telecom has no plans to change the nature of the telegram service. However, it is planning to improve the efficiency of the service by replacing the obsolete electro-mechanical telegram switching network-TRESS-with a more modern system, based on the telex network, using visual display screens and teleprinters. The replacement program is planned to commence in Western Australia during 1985, and in all other States during 1986.

      </para>
      <para>
       Cheeses exported from countries other than New Zealand, Canada, United States of America, United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Japan are subject to 120 days quarantine on arrival in Australia-less, in certain circumstances, the period of transport to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Cheeses normally subject to such quarantine may be exempted if the Director of Quarantine is satisfied that the manufacturing processes are sufficient to inactivate the virus of foot and mouth disease.
      </para>
      <para>
       Exemption as above is authorised by a Permit System and is dependent on, inter alia, the pasteurisation of the milk of origin (or other acceptable heat treatment) and the acidity levels achieved during manufacture, particularly at the time of maturation. Subject to these standards having been achieved, there is no necessity for a prescribed 'shelf life'.

       (b) All types of cheese are involved. The countries are as in (a) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Quarantine records show that several cheeses manufactured by the French company Societe Anonyme Fromageries Picon have been exempted by Permit from quarantine because they are processed cheeses which during manufacture have been heated to at least 90*C. Some of these cheeses are imported by air. Their shelf life is not relevant in the quarantine context.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) (i) (ii) At its meeting on 17 April 1984, the ABC Standing Committee on Spoken English-SCOSE-adopted guidelines for non-sexist language. These guidelines did not class any word as unacceptable for use by ABC broadcasters but rather suggested that certain words be avoided where they were inappropriate .
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) (i),(ii) A copy of pages 1 to 7 of the SCOSE minutes of 17 April, setting out the non-sexist guidelines, has been provided to the honourable member. Copies have been provided to the House of Representatives Table Office for distribution to other interested honourable members and are reproduced at the end of this answer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) None. The SCOSE document was issued for guidance and discussion.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. The ABC naturally hopes people appearing in its programs will refrain from deliberately sexist language. However, the Corporation acknowledges that it has no real control over the choice of language used by the public. Interviews will not be especially edited.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The ABC claims no authority to change what is standard or acceptable English in this country. It must be recognised, however, that language changes and it would therefore be inappropriate for the national broadcaster to ignore community moves against discrimination in language.

      </para>
      <para>
       STANDING COMMITTEE ON SPOKEN ENGLISH NON-SEXIST LANGUAGE GUIDELINES
      </para>
      <para>
       All ABC broadcasters should use language that avoids sex discrimination and other forms of discrimination. These guidelines have been prepared to assist broadcasters in the use of non-sexist language. The examples used reflect usage in recent ABC programs which appears to be exclusive or discriminatory.
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Avoid the use of words that imply that a particular group is all male or all female unless it is
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) 'The men in government will be voting on the bill next week.' 'The nurse will find her role increasingly complex in the modern hospital.'
      </para>
      <para>
       These instances wrongly imply that everybody in a particular group is of the same sex. It is better to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       'Government members will be voting . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       or, 'The Government will be voting . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       'The nurse will find his or her role . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       or, 'Nurses will find their roles . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) 'When you and your wife go to the pictures . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       Broadcasters should be aware that this is addressed only to the males in the audience. One of the following may be more appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       'When you go to the pictures . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       'When you and your partner go to the pictures . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       'When you and your spouse go to the pictures . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       'When you go to the pictures with your wife or husband . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       'When you and your husband go shopping . . .' assumes that the listener is female, and can be rewritten in the same way.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Avoid the use of he as a generic pronoun
      </para>
      <para>
       'It's all your average Australian really wants. He'll go to any length to get it.'
      </para>
      <para>
       'The doctor will find that after the introduction of 'Medicare' he may have to bulkbill.'
      </para>
      <para>
       'The driver will be paying more for his petrol after tonight's budget.'
      </para>
      <para>
       Traditionally, and particularly in legal contexts, the pronoun he has been used generically. This situation is changing, and it is better:
      </para>
      <para>
       to use he or she
      </para>
      <para>
       to recast the sentence into the plural, or, as is often possible without damaging the sense,
      </para>
      <para>
       to delete the pronoun altogether.
      </para>
      <para>
       The examples above can be rewritten:
      </para>
      <para>
       'It's all your average Australian really wants. He or she will go to any length to get it.'
      </para>
      <para>
       'Doctors will find that after the introduction of 'Medicare' they will have to bulkbill.'
      </para>
      <para>
       'Drivers will be paying more for (their) petrol after tonight's budget.'
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Avoid irrelevant gender description
      </para>
      <para>
       'A woman reporter asked the Prime Minister . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       This can be rewritten:
      </para>
      <para>
       'A reporter asked the Prime Minister . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       4. Avoid unequal gender descriptions
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) 'The girls seem anxious to go: that upsets the social balance, as too many young men remain.'
      </para>
      <para>
       Language used to designate and describe females and males should treat and sexes equally. Parallel language should be used for women and men. In the example above, if the assumption is that the two groups are of roughly the same age, the sentence should be rewritten:
      </para>
      <para>
       'The girls seem anxious to go: that upsets the social balance, as too many boys remain.'
      </para>
      <para>
       or, 'The young women seem anxious . . . too many young men remain.'
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) 'Mr Sam Jones and Mary Smith . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       'Michelle Ford . . . Michelle said . . .' but 'Kim Hughes . . . Hughes said . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       In the use of honorifics like Mr and Ms, consistency should be maintained. These examples should become:
      </para>
      <para>
       'Sam Jones and Mary Smith' or 'Mr Sam Jones and Ms Mary Smith . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       'Michelle Ford . . . Ms Ford said . . .' and 'Kim Hughes . . . Mr Hughes said . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       or, 'Michelle Ford . . . Ford said . . .' and 'Kim Hughes . . . Hughes said . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       In sporting contexts, the last of these would be preferable.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) 'The Premier and his attractive blonde wife . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       Descriptions should also grant equal respect to women and men. Emphasis on the physical characteristics of women is generally not appropriate where men are described in terms of professional or other achievements. It is better to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       'The Premier and his wife . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       5. Avoid sexist stereotypes and demeaning language
      </para>
      <para>
       'Speak to the girl on the switchboard.'
      </para>
      <para>
       'Women's libbers were out in force.'
      </para>
      <para>
       'Here's Nat King Cole's little girl.'
      </para>
      <para>
       Stereotypes offer many assumptions, little information and no originality. They tend to be expressed in cliches, which the broadcaster should avoid anyway. Stereotypes of women are often demeaning as well. Those with a serious commitment to feminism regard the use of 'women's libbers' as trite and insulting. The 'girl on the switchboard' is probably an adult, and may be a man. 'Nat King Cole's little girl' is in her thirties. Avoid stereotypes by using a simple word. Why not:
      </para>
      <para>
       'Speak to the telephonist'.
      </para>
      <para>
       'Feminists were out in force'.
      </para>
      <para>
       'Here's Nat King Cole's daughter, Natalie' or 'Here's Natalie Cole'?
      </para>
      <para>
       6. Avoid marked endings
      </para>
      <para>
       If there is no reason for distinguishing the sex of a person in marked endings, such as sculptress, poetess, authoress, or if in doing so the person described would be demeaned, then the marked ending should be avoided.
      </para>
      <para>
       Terms such as aviatrix, ambassadress, place women into a separate section of their particular discipline, occupation or role.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each time a women's sex is unnecessarily and irrelevantly highlighted, it perpetuates and reinforces the outdated attitude that woman is to be considered first as female and second as a person of talent or skill. So 'newspaper proprietress, Juanita Nielsen' should be 'newspaper proprietor, Juanita Nielsen' and 'sculptress Nancy Rieben' should be 'sculptor Nancy Rieben'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Actor, poet, sculptor, etc., should be used except where an institutional preference or the personal preference of the woman concerned is for actress, poetess, sculptress, etc.
      </para>
      <para>
       Flight attendant appears to be displacing air hostess and steward, and should be used where possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       7. Avoid gender marked terms
      </para>
      <para>
       Where reference is to be made to a position, a quality or an action that might apply to either sex, terms that seem to include only one sex should be avoided where possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Often the sentence can be recast.
      </para>
      <para>
       'The chairman of the meeting was Mr Brown',
      </para>
      <para>
       'It's a one-man operation',
      </para>
      <para>
       'A spokeswoman/spokesman for the union said that . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       can become:
      </para>
      <para>
       'Mr Brown chaired the meeting',
      </para>
      <para>
       or, 'Mr Brown was in the chair',
      </para>
      <para>
       'It's run by one person',
      </para>
      <para>
       'Jenny Brown/George Brown, for (or on behalf of) the union, said that . . .'
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Alternatively, a sex-neutral term may be substituted.
      </para>
      <para>
       It may be possible to use a more specific word (e.g. financier for businessman, grazier for man on the land) where that would suit the context. Or there may be a close non-sexist alternative to the original word. An appropriate choice might be made from the following list, although NOT ALL ARE SYNONYMOUS.

      <para>
       (1) Is it a fact that on 19 August 1982 the Deputy Public Service Arbitrator Mr L. A. Booth, requested the Commonwealth Public Service Board to correct salary anomalies for professional engineers employed in the Commonwealth Public Service ; if so, what action has been taken by the Public Service Board to correct these anomalies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Is it also a fact that this Department is having great difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled and motivated professional engineers because of salary and classification anomalies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) What action is the Department taking to reclassify the grades of professional engineers employed within the Department to bring them more into line with levels of responsibility and salary in comparable work areas elsewhere .
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) What number of professional engineers (a) are engaged on a temporary or contract basis and (b) have worked for total periods of service in excess of 12 months within the Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Are temporary or contract staff subject to any police or security clearance .
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) It is a fact that his Department has insufficient permanent professional engineers to meet the function and role of his Department as presented to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure in April 1978.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Does his Department at present employ sufficient permanent staff to design and construct Sydney's second airport when the site is chosen without seriously imperilling its ability to handle client department requirements Australia-wide.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Why were a number of professional engineering positions abolished in his Department pursuant to notice published in the Public Service Gazette No. 38 dated 22 September 1983.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1)Yes; anomalies involving engineers or related designations have not been found to exist in the Department of Housing and Construction.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Public Service Board defines the responsibility for each of the five classification levels in the engineer structure. It is also responsible for changes in the salaries at each of these five levels; in pursuance of that responsibility it consults with staff and professional associations and normally makes representations in the arbitral process.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department's engineering structure and its deployment of engineers is in a continual state of change to cope with variations in the volume and nature of work. The process of change includes the creation/abolition of positions of variations to the levels or duties with a view to ensuring that staff are employed at classification levels appropriate to its responsibilities arising from an approved project, works or program of works.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) As at 1 June 1984, the Department had 70 temporary and contract engineers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Of these 15 have been engaged for a period in excess of 12 months.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) On projects or parts of projects of national security assessment, my Department seldom uses temporary or contract staff and then only if they are security cleared.
      </para>
      <para>
       On projects involving commercial security risks, where normal burglar possibilities might arise, both temporary and contract staff are utilised. These persons are supervised by permanent staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Typically such a project would be catered for by forming teams comprising existing staff experienced in aerodrome pavements and building works together with private consultants. These teams would probably be supplemented by some additionally recruited staff and by the use of contract personnel to meet peaks as they occur in the design process.
      </para>
      <para>
       The extent and number of in-house staff to be deployed into the project team would depend upon other approved Government building and engineering projects existing at that time.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) In line with then Government directives, my Department increased its use of private consultants on design workload through the second half of the 1970s and the early 1980s. The resulting reduction in overall staff requirements at the lower end of the five class engineer structure led to the abolition of long term vacant positions of Engineer Class 1 and Class 2, in accordance with Public Service Board policy.

       (1) A recent survey of egg prices charged in three Canberra stores and two Sydney stores indicated that the retail price of eggs in Canberra is from 7c to 15c per dozen higher than the retail price for the equivalent product in Sydney. I have asked my Department to examine egg marketing arrangements in Canberra and to advise me as soon as possible of the options available to ensure Australian Capital Territory consumers are not charged excessive prices for eggs.

       (2) Yes, Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd. I am advised that as the wholesale price of eggs charged by this producer is the same as that charged by the New South Wales Egg Corporation, this producer does not appear to be taking advantage of its position to earn excessive profits.

       The helipad at Concord Repatriation General Hospital is currently equipped with a rotorstrobe navaid guidance portable night lighting system designed and developed in Australia. The Department of Aviation advises that, while this system may be of some assistance to helicopter pilots conducting emergency night landings and take-offs, it is not suitable for routine flight operations. The Department further advises that as the use of the Concord helipad at night is very infrequent and in emergencies can be used under its mercy flight provisions , no plans to install a permanent lighting system are presently under consideration.

Under the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, New Zealand is committed to phase out the performance-based export incentives in trans-Tasman trade by 1987 commencing with a 50 per cent cut in entitlements next year. This will affect the eligibility of margarine exporters to claim export performance taxation incentives and export suspensory loans on exports to Australia.

      <para>
       The questions relate to my media release of 21 March 1984 following the Australia/Economic Community ministerial consultations on trade and related issues which were held in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       The answer to the first question is that the phrase 'high quality Community exports to Australia' refers to exports of textiles, clothing and footwear-TCF- and passenger motor vehicles.
      </para>
      <para>
       The answer to the second question is that the media release does not give greater emphasis to access for these products to Australia than it gives to access for Australian products to the EEC.
      </para>
      <para>
       The major part of my statement is in fact taken up with Australia's concerns in relation to agricultural trade. For example, after introductory paragraphs, the first substantive paragraph states 'the consultations were wide ranging, a major focus from the Australian side being agricultural trade issues, including access to the EC and Community subsidy practices in third markets'. Subsequent paragraphs develop further Australian concerns with access into the EC for agricultural products.
      </para>
      <para>
       The penultimate paragraph of my media release states 'it was also recognised that it would be necessary to continue discussing difficulties of access for both sides and especially for high quality Community exports to Australia and the operation of non-tariff barriers'. This paragraph is part of a section of my statement dealing with trade in manufactures. The Community for its part has concerns about the operation of tariff quota and import licensing systems in relation to its high quality exports of TCF and passenger motor vehicles. Australia has also expressed concern to the EC about the operation of non-tariff barriers such as export franchise restrictions and administrative obstructions to its exports of manufactures to the EC.

      <para>
       Statistics on Aboriginals have been produced and released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (and its predecessors) prior to 1967. The most comprehensive sources are the censuses of the Commonwealth held in 1911, 1921, 1933, 1947, 1954 and 1966. Data on Aboriginals for States and Territories were published in the Statistician's report for each census. However, the degree of coverage and information obtained varied substantially.
      </para>
      <para>
       The 1966 census was the first in which an attempt was made to enumerate the entire Aboriginal population. At all earlier censuses, Aboriginal people living outside settled areas were not counted. Data collected on Aboriginals in the 1966 census were published in two bulletins: 'The Aboriginal Population of Australia-Summary of Characteristics' and '1966 Census of Population and Housing -Volume 1, Part 2-Race'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Prior to the first Commonwealth census in 1911, statistics on Aboriginals were obtained by censuses conducted by State government bodies. In addition, some data on Aboriginals were collected regularly by State government bodies after the first Commonwealth census. The best source for such data is the monograph by Dr L. R. Smith 'The Aboriginal Population of Australia' published by the ANU Press in 1980.

      <para>
       I am of course aware of the fact that many distinguished people around the world advocate various forms of world government as a means of resolving the security and other problems of mankind. That is a noble ideal but it is not, in the Government's view, a practical basis for Australian foreign policy in 1984. As most advocates of world government recognise, securing international agreement to establish an effective supra-national authority would be considerably more difficult and problematic than everything else which has been attempted in international relations to date and would in no way circumvent the problems and conflicts which afflict existing international institutions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Moreover, I cannot accept a proposition to the effect that a commitment to world government is the only way to world security. Instead the Government believes in tackling present day problems with energy and determination bringing to bear in this endeavour all the resources available to the Australian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am glad to say that we work closely in this enterprise with many other countries. The Australian and Swedish governments co-operate particularly closely in seeking to bring about effective international agreements for disarmament and for assistance to the economic development of poorer countries.

      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of the pesticide Galecron based on the chemical chlordimeform there are no Swiss registrations. This is not unexpected because the compound is utilised only on cotton and no cotton is grown in Switzerland. Though chlordimeform is approved for such use in Australia it is available only to licensed aerial operators under conditions which preclude the possibility of operators or bystanders being exposed.
      </para>
      <para>
       For a fuller understanding of the issues involved in these questions the following information is helpful.
      </para>
      <para>
       Chlordimeform was discovered in the early 1960s and was developed by Ciba-Geigy and Schering AG as a novel insecticide/acaricide. Prior to September 1976 the product was registered in Australia and many other countries for the control of various insect and mite pests on cotton, pome fruit, stone fruit, vegetables, tomatoes and strawberries as well as for the control of cattle tick. The toxic action of chlordimeform on insects and mites is by direct contact and vapour activity against both mobile stages and eggs.
      </para>
      <para>
       In September 1976 Ciba-Geigy and Schering AG suspended production sales and registrations of all products containing chlordimeform world-wide. This decision was based on interim findings of a lifetime mouse feeding study. In the development of chlordimeform prior to marketing a wide range of toxicology testing had been completed on a range of laboratory animals. These studies showed no adverse effects. However, in the subsequent mouse feeding study chlordimeform caused a dose-related increase in a particular type of tumour at high feeding levels. A lower dose of chlordimeform produced no tumours even at the end of the two-year feeding study.
      </para>
      <para>
       During 1976 and 1977 research programs conducted by the manufacturers in several countries demonstrated conclusively that exposure to chlordimeform, when applied by air, could be minimised and in most cases maintained below the limits of detection by the use of additional but reasonable practical precautionary measures at application sites. Based on these studies the manufacturers considered chlordimeform could be re-introduced for use on cotton in Australia with usage strictly limited and controlled in the initial season to demonstarte that negligible exposure would result. Following evaluation of the new scientific data by health and agricultural authorities the product was registered and re-introduced to New South Wales in the 1978-79 cotton season. Authority was expanded to include Queensland in 1979-80.
      </para>
      <para>
       The precautionary measures introduced for handling chlordimeform were aimed at reducing the possibility of dermal exposure to the chemical during mixing, loading and marketing operations. Detailed operating instructions and guidelines were issued to all authorised users and all persons involved in the application of chlordimeform have been regularly monitored to determine whether they have carried out the precautionary measures as indicated by the absence of traces of chlordimeform from their urine.
      </para>
      <para>
       The use of chlordimeform based products has been subject to annual review in Australia and that review has been based heavily on the urine monitoring results from the previous season. This type of monitoring is carried out in most, if not all, countries where chlordimeform is used for the treatment of cotton. Experience over the six seasons during which these controls have been in place has shown that the exercise has been successful. Because of the success of the operation and the experience gained it has been agreed that the compulsory monitoring of operators will be replaced by a voluntary scheme where, if an operator potentially exposed to chlordimeform wishes to submit a urine sample, the analysis will be performed and the results will be communicated back to the operator. This allows individuals to monitor their occupational hygiene and handling practices and puts the onus on the operator to act carefully and responsibly.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to the application manual issued to all licensed applicators, label bear explicit recommendations for the safe handling of chlordimeform based products including specific directions for the use of appropriate protective clothing.
      </para>
      <para>
       All of these steps were initiated by the manufacturers but each step was subject to detailed evaluation and approval by the appropriate health and agricultural authorities.

Robins Pty Ltd, advised my Department of the voluntary suspension of marketing of the device in the USA following reports, in that country, of second trimester septic abortion associated with its use. Withdrawal of the product from the Australian market was not undertaken, or requested, at that time in view of the absence of reports of similar incidents occurring in Australia. However, letters were circulated to doctors in Australia by A. H. Robins in July 1974 and by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee-ADEC-in October 1974, inviting submission of details of any similar local adverse effects. In February 1975, the ADEC concluded the available information was insufficient to allow any firm conclusion to be reached. Meantime, A. H. Robins voluntarily suspended sale of the Dalkon shield in Australia as from 18 January 1975, pending the implementation of changes to the presentation of the device.

Furthermore my Department monitors hazard alerts on medical devices from a number of overseas sources and co-ordinates recalls, if indicated, on a voluntary basis in co-operation with local importers .

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) As I indicated in my response to question No. 983 (Hansard, 28 February 1984, page 120 refers) the JICC comprises representatives of the dairy industries of Australia and New Zealand, with Government representatives attending only in an observer capacity. I am advised by Mr M. L. Vawser, the leader of the Australian delegation to the JICC meeting held on 10 May 1984, that the following subjects were discussed and agreements reached.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both delegations expressed grave concern at the continuing overproduction of milk throughout the world, in particular in the European Economic Community and United States of America, at a time when there is little, if any, total market growth. The delegations were convened to see the rapid rise in world stocks and the consequential dampening effect this has had on world export prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both delegations noted that Australia and New Zealand would be ending the 1983- 84 season with relatively higher levels of stock of the major manufactured products than normal and that this would create pressures to place that additional stock in the new season. It was also noted that, for the season, both the Australian and New Zealand dairy industries are predicting at least a maintenance of the current level of milk production in each country and this in turn would generate higher than desirable levels of product for the export market. The delegations agreed that, in these circumstances, close liaison would be required between the two industries to avoid aggravating the downward pressure on market returns.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both delegations agreed to co-operate as closely as possible in monitoring developments in the international market for butter.
      </para>
      <para>
       The delegations agreed that the current International Dairy Arrangement under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-GATT-formed a valuable part in maintaining some semblance of rationality in world market activity and stressed the importance of the GATT minimum pricing arrangements at their current levels in placing a floor in the world marketing price. Both delegations agreed to resist any moves to lower the GATT minimum prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some concern was expressed by the New Zealand delegation at the slow-down in the rate of growth in the Australian cheese market in 1983 (3 per cent compared with 8.9 per cent in 1982) and discussion took place on the measures which have been implemented by the Australian dairy industry in an endeavour to generate a higher level of growth. This aspect will be monitored and efforts will continue to be made to add further to that growth. In accordance with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding on Dairy Products attached to the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, it is expected that exports of cheese to Australia from New Zealand will increase by some 400 tonnes in 1984 to approximately 6,400 tonnes. It was noted that there had been a significant reduction in New Zealand exports of edam to Australia and this trend was considered likely to continue throughout 1984. The New Zealand delegation advised that the New Zealand Dairy Board's-NZDB-recent takeover of a major Australian cheese importing and marketing company would assist it in the orderly marketing of New Zealand cheese in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       In general, both delegations agreed that the forthcoming 1984-85 season would be one of extreme difficulty for the industries in both Australia and New Zealand, given the continuing upward trend in milk production and declining world prices. The two industries agreed to continue close consultation to take advantage of any marketing opportunities which might arise in the interests of maximising the returns to dairy farmers on both sides of the Tasman.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I am advised by the Leader of the Australian delegation that the Australian side expressed concern at the continued low pricing of New Zealand ice cream and related products. Whilst it was acknowledged that imports of New Zealand ice cream were very low relative to the size of the Australian ice cream market, exceptionally low pricing of New Zealand ice cream, iced confection and ice cream mix were a disruptive influence in the Australian ice cream market. The NZDB advised that it was still investigating the matter. The Australian delegation provided the NZDB with comparative retail pricing information, compiled by the Ice Cream Manufacturers' Federation of Australia, to assist in the NZDB's assessments.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am advised that the apparent increase in imports of skim milk powder from New Zealand reflects the inclusion of powdered ice cream mix under the statistical item for skim milk powder while the casein imported from New Zealand is of a specification which is not produced by Australian manufacturers. I understand that there has been no complaint to the ADC or to my Department from Australian manufacturers regarding the volume or pricing of New Zealand casein.

       Aussat's intention is to finalise launch insurance arrangements during the course of this calendar year, that is, about 6 months before first launch. As yet a firm quote for launch insurance has not been received. Accordingly, it is not possible to quantify the cost of launch insurance for Aussat's first two satellites if taken out 12 months ago, since no firm quotes were available. Furthermore, it is not possible to quantify the cost of launch insurance now, since no firm quotes are available.

      <para>
       (1) My answer to the honourable member's earlier question No. 1046 in this House was not concerned with the development of an electromagnetic gun. Rather, it acknowledged work being performed by my Department in co-operation with the United States Department of Defense on research into the technology of electromagnetic launchers.
      </para>
      <para>
       This matter has stimulated considerable interest in this Parliament with the honourable member for Hindmarsh having asked two supplementary questions on notice in this House-Nos 1488 and 1492-Senator Chipp having asked one question without notice, Senate Hansard, 10 May 1984, page 1929, and two questions on notice-Nos. 910 and 911 on 29 May 1984. Also, Senator Macklin chose the first reading of the Live-Stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill and cognate Bills-Senate Hansard, 7 June 1984, pages 2742-2744-to deliver a lengthy speech on this same general subject.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the record, the Materials Research Laboratories in my Department commenced its current research program on electromagnetic launchers in 1979. The bilateral arrangement on this subject between Australia and the United States of America commenced in 1980. The prospective military implications of this technology mentioned in the United States-Australia bilateral arrangement relate only to tactical conventional warfare.
      </para>
      <para>
       All the research work performed by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in my Department is oriented towards solving problems for the Australian Defence Force.

      <para>
       Co-operation with allied countries and the ensuing sharing of results frequently saves us a great deal of money.
      </para>
      <para>
       The timing and significance of the Australian National University contribution to this work is of some interest. The theoretical basis of propulsion using travelling electromagnetic fields has existed since early this century. However, its practical application has been greatly facilitated by work which commenced some 30 years ago at the ANU and led to the development, by the mid-1960s, of a novel form of homopolar generator. Much later, this came to the notice of the DSTO and, separately, the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was largely as a result of this development that the proposal for a co-operative R and D program between Australia and the United States of America on electromagnetic guns and launchers and pulsed power conditioning was put forward by the United States of America in 1980. The ANU work was not conceived with any defence applications in mind.
      </para>
      <para>
       With this explanation the answer to the first part of the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. The agreement is being considered for renewal on essentially the same terms as in 1980.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The SDI is a long term US research program designed to examine the potential for new technologies to provide defence against ballistic missile attack. The Australian Government understands the genuineness of the pressures of concern that led the United States to undertake this research program-in particular the attractions of an approach which seeks to prevent nuclear war by placing increased emphasis on defence rather than threatening a devastating nuclear counter-attack-but is concerned about the possible implications of SDI for outer space arms control and the maintenance of a stable strategic balance between the superpowers. The US Government has been made aware of Australian concerns.
      </para>
      <para>
       These concerns have also been expressed to the Soviet Government which is also believed to be undertaking research programs on possible space weapons.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian Ministers have expressed on a number of occasions the Government's concern that outer space is the coming arena of superpower competition and have called for the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Military activity in outer space is already circumscribed through several existing arms control agreements. The Government supports strengthening this arms control regime through further verifiable agreements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia is an active participant in the consideration of outer space issues in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. It is encouraging the Conference to think through the longer term implications of recent developments relating to outer space before irreversible steps are taken. It urges all countries, especially those with space capabilities, to work in good faith to avoid an arms race in outer space.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) At this stage the SDI is confined to a research program and a decision on whether to develop and deploy such a system is not expected until the early 1990s. The 1972 ABM Treaty and its 1974 protocol ban the development, testing and deployment of all ABM systems and components that are sea-based, air-based, space-based or mobile land-based. Although the treaty allows the development and testing of fixed land-based ABM systems and components, including those based on other physical principles (such as lasers and particle beams) it also requires that specific limitations on such systems would be the subject of discussions between the parties to the treaty in accordance with Article XIII of the treaty and agreement in accordance with article XIV of the treaty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Research on the technologies involved in ballistic missile defence is not in conflict with either superpower's obligations under the ABM Treaty-the Government understands that the Soviet Union is also conducting an extensive program of research and development into the possible application of new and existing technologies for such purposes-but raises questions as to its longer term viability. A decision by either superpower to proceed beyond research would have implications for the current ABM Treaty and clearly would require discussions between the parties to the treaty. The Government understands that, in this context, the United States has proposed government-to-government discussions with the Soviet Union on the implications of these technologies which both sides are exploring.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Nuclear-pumped lasers are only one of a number of possible technologies being examined under the SDI research program. The question as to whether a nuclear-pumped laser would constitute a 'nuclear weapon' or be more akin to a nuclear power source currently used in some space vehicles, could not be considered until the details of any proposed operational systems are available.
      </para>
      <para>
       Any nuclear explosion in space would contravene the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, to which both the United States and the Soviet Union are parties.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Australian Government is co-operating with the US Government in research and development of electromagnetic launchers because it believes that such research has potential benefits for the Australian Defence Force. The specific project arrangement covering this co-operation relates to anti-armour, air defence and artillery weapons that are of direct interest to Australia, and not to any possible strategic or space applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government does not believe there is any inconsistency between its position outlined in (1) and (2) above and its commitment to arms control as most recently expressed in statements by the Prime Minister on 6 June 1984 and the Foreign Minister on 4 July 1984.

       The proposition to install a box at the Strathfield Plaza Shopping Centre has been examined by Australia Post and it has been found that adequate vehicle access at the Plaza, for clearance of a box located there, would not be available. Further, there are already two posting boxes located less than 200 metres from the Plaza, with safe pedestrian access to both. Both boxes are well patronised. Australia Post considers that existing posting facilities are meeting the needs of the Plaza satisfactorily.

      <para>
       In respect of parts (1) and (2) the New Zealand High Commission advises electronic machines attracting a sales tax rate of 40 per cent in New Zealand are office machines, classified under headings 84.51, 84.52, or 84.53 of the New Zealand Customs Tariff; photocopying and thermo-copying apparatus, classified under heading 90.10; automatic data processing machines and units thereof, magnetic or optical readers, machines for transcribing data onto data media in coded form and machines for processing such data, being goods classified under heading 84.53 of the Customs Tariff. None of the above machines attract a duty of 25 per cent when of Australian origin-indeed, except for guillotines and paper shredders (duty rate 10 per cent), they are all duty free when of Australian origin.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sales tax is generally paid on the price at which the goods are sold by a licensed wholesaler in terms of the Sales Tax Act 1974. When the machines are imported into New Zealand by a person who is not a licensed wholesaler, sales tax is leviable on a value calculated from the sum of the following amounts:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the value of the goods for the purposes of customs duty;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) the amount of customs duty;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) the amount or proportionate part thereof paid to the Crown for the issue of an import licence;
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) the amount paid to transport the goods to New Zealand and to insure the goods for such transport and;

      <para>
       (e) 25 percent of the sum of the amounts referred to in (a) to (d) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       This formula is intended to provide a measure of equality on the value for sales tax purposes of imported goods, irrespective of the status of the importer , by establishing a notional wholesale value.
      </para>
      <para>
       In respect of part (3) Australian ad-valorem duties are calculated by reference to the customs value of the dutiable goods. The customs value is determined in accordance with an International Agreement, to which both Australia and New Zealand are parties, and in general is based on the price of the goods with a limited range of adjustments. The Agreement allows parties the option of including or excluding overseas freight and insurance in the customs value. Australia does not include these costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Electronic office machines entering Australia in the main fall to headings 84. 51, 84.52, 84.53, 84.54 and 90.10 in the Australian tariff. When imported from New Zealand such machines presently are free of import duty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian sales tax is levied on a value which is 120 percent of the sum of:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the value of duty of the imported goods;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) the amount of duty applicable.
      </para>
      <para>
       The sales tax levied is in accordance with the Sales Tax Assessment Act (Number 5) of 1930. In the case of electronic office machines the rate of sales tax is 20 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the basis of the foregoing information it would seem that Australian producers of electronic office machines are not disadvantaged in Trans-Tasman trade vis-a-vis their New Zealand counterparts.

      <para>
       (1) There is an organisation within the Launceston workshops, but it is known as the Combined Railway Union's Committee-CRUC-
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Australian Metal Founders and Shipwrights Union-AMFSU-Electrical Trades Union-ETU-and Australian Railways Union-ARU;

      <para>
       (b) The Committee does not have any authority in the management of AN's Launceston workshops.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. However the CRUC placed bans on such employees and as a consequence AN has been subjected to intermittent work bans since August 1983. The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was notified of a dispute at that time, and several hearings have taken place without resolution. There has been no discrimination against any group of AN employees to the advantage of others. AN' s approach has been and will continue to be to take all possible steps to meet each situation in a responsible manner and endeavour to resolve problems in an unbiased way.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) An undertaking was given to Mr Commissioner Cross during Arbitration proceedings that AN would not exacerbate the situation by suspending employees who were acting in accordance with a union ban. It was agreed by all parties at the Arbitration proceedings that the unions be given some time to resolve the matter amongst themselves. However this has not occurred to date.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Tasmanian Region of AN has lost revenue because of this inter-union dispute.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Indonesia's claim to Irian Jaya arose after the Indonesian Republic achieved independence in 1949. The Indonesian claim was based on the grounds that Irian Jaya had always been an integral part of the Dutch East Indies and, as the successor state to the Dutch East Indies, it should have sovereignty over the territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1950 negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia concerning the status of Irian Jaya broke down, and eventually the matter was submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in 1954. Following further inconclusive diplomatic manoeuvres and armed conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia, the Netherlands agreed to transfer the territory to the United Nations on 1 May 1962. Administration of Irian Jaya was subsequently transferred to Indonesia in May 1963.
      </para>
      <para>
       There was a provision in the transfer for an 'Act of Free Choice' to be held under the United Nations auspices. A plebiscite took place in 1969 which was found to result in a vote in favour of integration with Indonesia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Like the great majority of the international community, the Australian Government recognises Irian Jaya as an integral part of the Republic of Indonesia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Concerning East Timor, you will be aware that during my visit to Indonesia in April 1984, I noted on behalf of the Australian Government that East Timor had been incorporated into the Republic of Indonesia, but expressed the Government's deep concern that an internationally supervised act of self determination had not taken place. The Indonesian Government maintains that the status of East Timor as a province of Indonesia was decided in a vote on integration held in East Timor in July 1976.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Government has been monitoring developments along the Indonesian-Papua New Guinea border closely. As regards the repatriation of people from Irian Jaya who have recently crossed the border and are now in PNG, the Government has noted assurances by PNG's Foreign Minister, Mr Namaliu, to the PNG Parliament that those Irianese who have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their involvement in dissident activities in Indonesia should be allowed to stay in PNG for the time being.
      </para>
      <para>
       Regarding the role of international refugee organisations, the Government is aware that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR has been in contact with PNG and Indonesian authorities concerning the Irianese border crossers. To date, the PNG and Indonesian authorities have preferred to seek arrangements for the repatriation of the border crossers between themselves . In the Australian Government's view, it is necessary that the solution to the problem of border crossers should take full account of the important humanitarian considerations that are involved.

       (3) The Government makes representations on human rights on behalf of dissidents in countries across the political and geographical spectrum, including Indonesia. While in each case the Government's approach is adjusted to achieve the most effective result in the relevant circumstances, this does not in any way diminish the Government's commitment to see internationally recognised human rights standards universally protected and promoted.

       I am very conscious of the financial difficulties facing RPH stations around Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the honourable member may be aware, in announcing RPH services in 1978, the then Minister indicated that it was expected that RPH stations would be financially self-supporting. For various reasons including the fact that RPH frequencies are off the primary broadcasting band and that many print handicapped persons are on low incomes, it has become evident that RPH stations are experiencing significant funding difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because of this and other problems being experienced by RPH stations, I instructed my Department in August 1983 to conduct a review of RPH services. An important part of the review is an examination of the funding issue. I expect the review of RPH to be completed in the next few months.

       No. There has been something of a concerted campaign, emanating from inaccurate press reports, by various interests concerned that the Religious and Rural Departments will be downgraded as a result of the ABC's re-organisation. The ABC has assured me that this is not the case.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am advised that, under the new structure for the ABC, approved by the Board of Directors, the Religious Department will become a separate unit in both radio and television with a functional head, who will cover both media. The specialist identity of the Religious Department will therefore be maintained and religious programs will continue to have an importance place in ABC schedules.
      </para>
      <para>
       The previously integrated Rural Department has also been separated into radio and television groups. Administrative structures, which were relevant 30 years ago-before the ABC operated a television service-are no longer appropriate. In preparation for the introduction of a second regional radio network, the ABC is also planning to establish a number of new regional offices and studios as extra commitment to rural listeners.

These include the taking of cetaceans-whales, dolphins and porpoises-within the Australian fishing zone for the purpose of live display. The Act provides for public comment on an application for a permit and affords the applicant an opportunity to respond to those comments. The decision on granting or withholding a permit is based on consideration of the application, any comments and the applicant's response to those comments. No application for a permit to capture or import dolphins for live display for the proposed Springvale Park has been received to date 21 June 1984. Any comment on the issuing of permits at this stage would pre-empt the processes established under the Whale Protection Act 1980 for consideration of such applications.

      <para>
       Under the proposed legislation a person may dispose of assets of up to $2,000 per year-single-and $4,000 per year-married couple-without adequate financial consideration through such means as gifting. The value of assets disposed of without adequate financial consideration in excess of these limits is to be deemed the property of the donor. The value of such deemed assets is to be depleted by a flat 10 per cent per year so that it will be completely disregarded 10 years after the act of deprivation. In the case of a married couple, half the value is to be maintained against each pensioner.
      </para>
      <para>
       Upon the death of one of a married couple the treatment of any outstanding value will depend upon which partner legally owned the asset concerned. If it was jointly owned, half the outstanding value would continue to be maintained against the survivor. If owned wholly by the deceased pensioner, no amount would be maintained against the survivor; conversely, if it was solely owned by the surviving pensioner, the full amount outstanding would be maintained against that person.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to new claimants for pension, the Department will have regard to the disposal of assets in the five-year period prior to the person's application . However, no regard will be had to amounts disposed of prior to 1 June 1984. There will also be provision to shorten the five-year period where the applicant could not reasonably have expected to become eligible for a pension, for example , where due to an accident a person qualifies for invalid pension.

       (1) I announced on June 27, 1984 the Government's decision to continue present underwriting arrangements for dairy products to cover the 1984-85 season. The levels to apply for 1984-85 are as follows:

      <para>
       (2) The Government decided that underwriting for 1984-85 should be on a gross basis. Dairy underwriting will cost the Australian taxpayer about $12m in respect of the 1983-84 season and, if the Australian Dairy Corporation's estimates for 1984-85 are proven correct a similar amount for that season. Changing underwriting from a gross to net basis would have further increased the size of likely government contributions. If export market prices reach GATT international dairy arrangement minimum levels and Australian exporters cannot make sales, the marketing arrangements will be under pressure whether or not interest and storage costs are underwritten by the Government. The decision to continue underwriting for 1984-85 indicates quite clearly the Government's commitment to maintain a viable, economic and efficient dairy industry.

      <para>
       Excise duty was levied on spirit used in the fortification of wine from 1901 up until 1970 when a general excise on wine was introduced. Excise duty on fortifying spirit was not re-imposed when excise was removed on wine in 1972, but was introduced in the 1983 Budget. The Government removed the excise on this spirit on 22 June 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the period 1901-1970 excise was collected at the time the fortified wine entered the market-place. It was possible to apply this system of revenue collection during that period as there was a consistent return of revenue and changes in rates were infrequent.
      </para>
      <para>
       With the imposition of the excise in 1983 it was recognised that if the revenue was to be paid at the time the fortified wines entered the market-place, there would be virtually no revenue return for two to three years and significant administrative problems would have arisen with the application of indexation, in determining the precise duty liability. For these reasons the duty was liable at the time of fortification and was collected under the Customs weekly settlement arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the period between 1901 and 1970, Customs needed to control the fortified wine until it was delivered for home consumption. Any premises storing such product pending duty payment were required to be licensed Customs premises for the storage of under bond goods.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the arrangements existing between 23 August 1983 and 22 June 1984, all premises using spirit to fortify Australian wine were subject to Customs control . However, there was no Customs interest in the fortified wine and it could be stored, moved and sold without any Customs controls being necessary.

      <para>
       The effects of the imposition of the excise on fortifying spirit, in the 1983 Budget, have been monitored by the Government. Information obtained from the major fortified wine producing regions indicated that the excise had produced a significant reduction in grape intake for fortified wine production, a reduction in, or cessation of, production of fortified wines by wineries, and the closure of a grape spirit distilling plant. No major grape surplus occurred as the impact on grape growers was masked by an increase in table wine production, largely to replenish depleted stocks because of the particularly low 1983 vintage.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government accepted that the excise had been a factor contributing to the current difficulties of the industry and removed the excise with effect from 22 June 1984. In announcing the decision, the Treasurer indicated that removal of the excise should assist a substantial restoration of fortified wine production and that the Government will closely monitor developments in the industry.

       Duty free shopping facilities at Australian international airports are provided for the convenience of the travelling public and generate substantial Commonwealth revenues by way of fees for authority to trade on airports. The Commonwealth oversights all facets of the operation of the facility to ensure the maintenance of the highest possible standards for the travelling public.

       The shops are operated by private enterprises, selected following public tender action. Stocking policies are a matter for the business judgment of the operator , who responds to consumer demand.
      </para>
      <para>
       A range of Australian alcoholic beverages are available at airport duty free shops and compete on their merits with international brands. It should be noted that a number of Australian alcoholic beverages, notably wines, are not subject to duty and sales tax and thus there can be no price advantage in purchasing these lines at an airport duty free shop.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is of course, normal practice for manufacturers and distributors of alcoholic beverages to conduct in-shop promotions of particular product lines, and this is a common occurrence at airport outlets. Should Australian industry representatives wish to undertake similar promotional activities, they could contact the proprietors of the airport shops.

       This is because the excise item for fortifying spirit is a concessional one and departmental controls are therefore essentially applied to ensure that the spirit is used to fortify Australian wine. If it is not so used, the spirit currently attracts a rate of duty of $20.90 per litre of alcohol.

       Whilst the duty was removed on 22 June 1984 departmental controls will still need to be maintained to ensure the spirit is used for the concessional purpose of fortification.

      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian industry was aware of the changes and the implications they held for continued eligibility of their plants to export to the EEC. Consequently, both industry and Government regarded the visit as being of utmost importance for Australia's continuing trade in meat and offal with EEC countries.

       Apart from the application of quarantine regulations and Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, there are no comprehensive Commonwealth inspection arrangements for imported foods either at the place of manufacture or point of entry. Commonwealth involvement is largely limited to the administration of quarantine control, tariffs and prohibited imports rather than the inspection of imported produce.
      </para>
      <para>
       The whole subject of food laws in Australia has been raised within the Australian Agricultural Council and it has been recommended that more attention needs to be given to the policing of Australian food law to ensure compliance of both domestic and imported foods. Action is in train in this regard.

        —On 3 April 1984 (Hansard, page 1247), Mr Millar asked me a question without notice concerning the categorisation of private hospitals. I undertook then to give the honourable member a more detailed answer:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The classification of private hospitals into categories was not introduced until Medicare, consequently the reference to restoration of individual hospitals to their former categories is quite wrong.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reason for the variation of the original categories of eight private hospitals in Queensland on 23 March 1984 was that I had approved and had gazetted amended categorisation guidelines. I would mention that the original guidelines had the support of the State Health Ministers, as do the amended guidelines. The amendments had the effect of broadening the criteria for category two hospitals which of course enabled me to reclassify some hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       As both the Commonwealth bed day subsidy to private hospitals and the health insurance benefits are paid in accordance with the determined category for each hospital, and as the amended guidelines only have effect from 22 March 1984-( determinations for the individual hospitals were effected on 23 March 1984)- there is no scope for backdating any payments to hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is likely that some of the Queensland hospitals may have been penalised financially by the uncooperative attitude of Mr Austin, the Queensland Minister for Health. He had the opportunity before Medicare started, and all the time since, to recommend to me that particular hospitals be reclassified, and failed to do so. The gazetted guidelines give me a discretionary power to accept such a recommendation regardless of the criteria requirements. Mr Austin refused to support any reclassification of Queensland hospitals, except in those cases where I initiated the changes.

       (1) Has his attention been drawn to (1) an article in the Australian Financial Review of 15 February 1984, relating to the introduction of electronic funds transfer (EFT) and (b) a call by the Chairman of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Mr Justice Michael Kirby, for comprehensive federal legislation to deal with issues raised by EFT such as consumer rights of data access and challenge privacy and data security and the need to update the law of cheques for the age of EFT.

       (1) Yes. Indeed, I mentioned the numerous issues that are arising in relation to EFT in answering a recent question without notice by Senator Crowley (Senate Hansard, 24 March 1984, p. 795).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) in its 1983 Report on Privacy has already adverted to the privacy implications of EFT and has drawn attention to the need for privacy protective standards to be considered at the earliest possible stage of EFT system design and to be built in from the outset (para 441 of Report). My Department has in hand the consideration of the draft privacy legislation that the ALRC has recommended. I hope to be able to introduce that legislation in the near future and some aspects of it will have relevance to EFT developments. I refer the honourable member in this connection to my answer to a question without notice by Senator Bolkus in Senate Hansard, 15 June 1984, p. 3135.
      </para>
      <para>
       Also, my colleague, the Treasurer, has established an interdepartmental working party to assess whether more formal arrangements than presently exist (including , if appropriate, legislation) covering the rights and obligations of users and providers of EFT are necessary, and if so, the scope of any such arrangements. All Commonwealth Departments with an interest in developments in the EFT field, including my own, are represented on the working party as is the Reserve Bank. Given my Department's active consideration of the ALRC Report on Privacy and the establishment of the working party on EFT, it would not be appropriate to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission.

       The Report of Biological Effects of Inhaled Radionuclides (B.E.I.R.) of 1980 is certainly a serious discussion of the 'hot particle theory'. It confirms the conclusions of the B.E.I.R. panel which reported on the hot particle theory in 1976.
      </para>
      <para>
       This subject is also addressed by the International Commission on Radiation Protection (I.C.R.P.) in its publication No. 31, May 1979, on biological effects on inhaled radionuclides. The report states that 'the hot particle issue has been addressed by numerous scientists and scientific bodies, all of which conclude that a hot particle effect with respect of fatal lung cancer has not been demonstrated in either human beings or experimental animals'. This is supported by 13 references. Following discussion the I.C.R.P. report then states : 'The task group concludes that the risk of lung cancer from inhaled radiation particles will be greatly overestimated if based on hot particle concepts'.

       (ii) At the request of the Lebanese Government, troops from the United States, together with contingents from France, Italy and the United Kingdom, formed a Multi-National Force which was deployed in Beirut in August 1982. This Force withdrew in February 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Syrian forces intervened in the Lebanese civil war in 1976 in support of the government of President Franjieh. They were subsequently merged with the Arab Deterrent Forces (ADF) which was formed at a meeting of the Arab League in Cairo in October 1976.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ADF comprised troops from Syria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and the two Yemens. The purpose of the ADF (which was largely made up of Syrian troops) was to establish and maintain a cease-fire between the various factions in Lebanon. Its presence in Lebanon was with the agreement of the Government of Lebanon.
      </para>
      <para>
       All elements of this Force, except those of Syria, were withdrawn from Lebanon by mid-1979. The Arab League's last six-month mandate for the ADF expired on 27 July 1982 and the future of the ADF was considered at the Arab League Summit in Fez in September 1982. The summit was informed of the 'Lebanese Government's decision to end the mission of the ADF' and agreed that the Lebanese and Syrian governments should negotiate to end the mission of the ADF, 'in the light of the Israeli withdrawal for Lebanon'. I understand however that no such formal negotiations have taken place.

       (iv) Two United Nations peace-keeping forces are at present in Lebanon, with the agreement of the Lebanese goverment.

      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The situation in Lebanon has been one of continuing concern since 1975. The UN has sought to play a role through UNIFIL and UNTSO, but without being able to prevent continuing hostilities. The Australian Government has consistently supported the United Nations in this peace-keeping role, and has supported Security Council resolutions calling for all parties to the conflict to cease all military activities within Lebanon. The Government has also, on numerous occasions, expressed its grave concern about the presence in Lebanon of foreign troops, especially since the Israeli invasion in June 1982, and has called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon which are not there at the request of the Lebanese Government.

      <para>
       (1) (a) and (b) Information held by my Department does not indicate precisely when the French Government first announced its intentions to conduct nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll. Nuclear testing at the French Pacific Tests Centre on Mururoa Atoll began in July 1966.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) (i) Since France does not announce when it has conducted a nuclear test, details about the number, nature and yield of nuclear tests conducted at Mururoa Atoll vary from source to source. The following information is based on details contained in the yearbooks of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and in the Report of the group of scientists from New Zealand, Australia and Papua New Guinea that visited Mururoa Atoll in October/November 1983. The data on underground tests at Mururoa Atoll contained in the latter Report was obtained largely from the New Zealand Seismological Laboratory with additional data calculated by the Australian Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) from the body wave estimates and identification located by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the International Seismological Centre (ISC).
      </para>
      <para>
       According to the above sources a total of 104 nuclear tests have been conducted by France in the South Pacific of which 41 were in the atmosphere and 63 underground.

       (2) France does not release information on planned nuclear tests. The number of nuclear tests conducted annually at Mururoa Atoll has, over recent years, averaged about eight. The Government has no reason to believe that this pattern is likely to change significantly over the next 12 to 24 months. The Government also expects that French nuclear tests will continue to be conducted underground .
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) Currently French nuclear tests are conducted only at Mururoa Atoll. France does, however, have a second nuclear testing site at Fangataufa island which is 50 km from Mururoa. The last nuclear explosion conducted at Fangataufa was on 26 November 1975 (see table above).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Government does not accept that the maintenance of the western deterrent requires any country to conduct nuclear tests in the South Pacific. In any event, the Government's view is that a universally adhered to comprehensive test ban treaty (CTB) which would ban all nuclear tests by all states in all environments would help to inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons by making it impossible to test nuclear explosive devices. It would also help to prevent the development of new nuclear weapons. A CTB would therefore be a major contribution to the strengthening of the security of all countries.

       (4) I am advised by the Minister for Trade who has responsibility for the commercial aspects of Australian uranium exports that on 26 August 1981, Queensland Mines Limited executed a uranium sales contract with Electricite de France, providing for the delivery of 2,600 short tons U308 over the period 1982 through 1988. This is the only Australian uranium sales contract covering supply to France approved by the present or previous Governments.

       (2) Yes. There have been comprehensive studies in Australia of the effects on inland waters of excess nutrients, such as phosphates.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Excess phosphates, combined with other nutrients, can cause environmentally harmful growth of algae in water bodies. This condition of excess, unbalanced growth is called eutrophication. Detergents represent only one source of phosphate. More is contributed from diffuse sources through run-off and erosion. Banning phosphate in detergent would have little general effect. Better land management and agricultural practices, leading to less loss of fertility from soil, may be more effective in improving water quality. Studies continue in this direction.

Further contractual costs for National implementation would amount to about $26m. Telecom expects the benefits through increased productivity, greater efficiency and improved service to the customer to more than justify the costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) On a national basis, it is estimated that some 1500-1700 fewer positions, mainly in clerical grades, will be required for processing orders compared to the needs of the present paper-based system. Telecom's business growth will give counter-balancing employment. At the proposed completion of implementation of DCRIS in 1988, Telecom's overall staff level is expected to be about the same as at present. Clerical staffing will be within 3 per cent of the current level but there will, of course, be changes to functions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Telecom is paying particular attention to ensure that its staff are well cared for. For example, I am advised that:
      </para>
      <para>
       No permanent staff will be retrenched because of DCRIS.
      </para>
      <para>
       Readjustment of staffing levels will be managed over an appropriate period.
      </para>
      <para>
       Redeployment will be voluntary so far as practicable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Retraining will be provided for staff moving to other jobs.
      </para>
      <para>
       In keeping with its standard practice when introducing major new technology, Telecom is engaged in detailed discussions with Staff Associations whose members would be affected by the introduction of the DCRIS system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. (a), (b) and (c) Telecom initially planned to introduce DCRIS at about the end of 1984 but more detailed programming has indicated that the project is larger than originally anticipated. Telecom informs me that it wishes to introduce DCRIS in the first Telecom District about mid 1985. Current Telecom planning envisages DCRIS in use Australia-wide by about the end of 1988.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Mr Bond, Mr Aarons, Mr Cassidy and Mr Long were already ABC staff members before their current appointments or promotions. Details of their positions, salaries and terms of appointment are as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1)-
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Mr Tony Bond: The Board of Directors, at its meeting of 28/29 July 1983 decided to create an independent Secretariat to provide advice. The Board created eleven short-term positions and recommended to the Acting Managing Director that Mr Bond (then interim staff representative of the Board) be appointed as the Co-ordinator of the new Secretariat. The position is set at Clerical Officer Class 11. Mr Bond's appointment was made by the Acting Managing Director. His temporary appointment is for a two year period, as from 1 August 1983. His total annual salary is $38,143.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Mr Mark Aarons: The Board of Directors determined that a number of Project Officers would be attached to the Board Secretariat. These positions were advertised and appointments were made following interview. Mr Aarons was one of the successful applicants. His position is that of Research Officer, Board Secretariat. His temporary appointment is from 5 March 1984 until 31 January 1986 and his total annual salary is $34,353.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Mr John Cassidy: Mr Cassidy was promoted to the position of Executive Producer, Radio Talks and Documentaries, Victoria. The position was advertised in the normal manner and Mr Cassidy was the recommended applicant for promotion. His promotion is to the permanent staff and his total annual salary is $30,445.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Mr Malcolm Long: The position of Controller Radio 2 became vacant following the retirement of its previous occupant. It has been filled by a number of acting Controllers pending the ABC's reorganisation. However, the ABC decided to advertise the position in the normal way. Mr Long was selected for promotion to the position. Because the Selection Committee unanimously recommended his promotion and the Board had accepted the recommendation, it was decided that Mr Long should act in the position until his promotion was confirmed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Long's provisional promotion was the subject of an appeal, but the situation has been overtaken by the ABC's restructuring in which the position of Controller Radio 2 will be abolished. Mr Long will continue to perform the duties associated with the position until appointments are made to newly-created senior positions. Mr Long's total annual salary is currently $52,551.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Normal procedures were used in the appointments of Mr Aarons and Mr Cassidy ; applications were called and recommendations made. In Mr Bond's case the appointment was by recommendation of the Board of Directors.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a result of actions the Board is taking to restructure the ABC, a number of senior management positions have been abolished and a new management structure created. Amongst the positions abolished was the position to which Mr Long has been provisionally promoted. The ABC is in the process of filling these new positions.

      <para>
       (1) Safeguards procedures such as inspection arrangements for nuclear facilities, including power reactors, are provided for in agreements negotiated between the International Atomic Energy Agency and its member states. These arrangements set out the rights and duties of the Agency and the member state in relation to the application of safeguards. Part of this involves the Agency's inspection rights. These include providing advance notice in most cases although the timing of inspections is a matter for the Agency. Normally the IAEA arranges that its inspectors are present during crucial operations (for instance, the annual discharge and reloading of the fuel of a light water reactor, or when the operator is taking a physical inventory of all nuclear material in a facility).
      </para>
      <para>

       (3) The Government has demonstrated its commitment to enhancing international nuclear safeguards. In May 1983 I reaffirmed Australia's support for the IAEA and its safeguards system to Dr Blix, the Director-General; and this was confirmed when Dr Blix visited Australia in March 1984. The Government approved in 1983 a three-year program of assistance to the Agency in safeguards research and development. The Government also commissioned in 1983 an independent inquiry by ASTEC into Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle including nuclear safeguards arrangements. The recommendations of the ASTEC Inquiry including those relating to nuclear safeguards and the resolution on uranium policy adopted by the 1984 ALP National Conference are currently under active consideration by the Government. The Government's objective is to subject all future exports of Australia's uranium to the most stringent supply conditions, and to augment the effectiveness of the IAEA safeguards system and other nuclear controls arrangements.

The claims in the London Times article appear to be based on a number of academic and United States Government sources, including the Congressional Record of the Hearings before the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, House of Representatives 97th Congress, 17 September 1981. Evidence given at those hearings illustrates the difficulties in obtaining accurate, reliable and meaningful statistical data on drug abuse by United States servicemen.

       (1) and (2) The Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Program was introduced by the previous Government in the context of the 1982-83 Budget. It was announced that the purpose of the Program was ' . . . to bring about a lasting improvement in the road and transport system of the nation'.

      <para>
       The ABRD Trust Fund Act 1982, which establishes the Program, provides that a State may direct urban arterial road funds to urban public transport capital projects where the Federal Minister is satisfied that the project is accorded a priority by the State and would, if undertaken, result in the reduction of the traffic on, or the wear and tear affecting, urban arterial roads in the State.
      </para>
      <para>
       In accordance with these provisions of the Act, all States and the Northern Territory have sought funding for urban public transport projects under this element of the Program. The first urban public transport projects were approved by the then Minister for Transport and Construction, the Hon. R. J. Hunt, MP, on 8 February 1983 when he agreed to $10.346m being directed to the Kingston- Beenleigh rail electrification project and six passenger interchanges in Brisbane. On 2 March 1983 Mr Hunt also approved a contribution of $15.125m to the Petrie-Caboolture rail electrification project in Brisbane.

      <para>
       (1) I am informed that a pesticide containing Chlordimeform was used in Egypt for a period up to 1976, at which time it was withdrawn. There have been media reports in Europe that the alleged experiment referred to took place but I am not able to confirm the accuracy of such reports. An evaluation of Chlordimeform by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1983 said: 'No data was available on the carcinogenicity of Chlordimeform to experimental animals. However, results of experiments in mice provide sufficient evidence that para- chloro-ortho-toluidine, a metabolite of Chlordimeform, is carcinogenic to experimental animals. No relevant data on humans was available. The available data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Chlordimeform to humans '.
      </para>

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes, on 1 June 1978.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) On the closure of the Hobby's Yards exchange which was located in the Neville charging zone, subscribers were transferred to the Barry exchange which is situated in the Blayney zone. As all subscribers to an exchange are charged according to the charging zone in which the exchange is situated, the former Hobby's Yards subscribers gained local call access to both Orange and Bathurst.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is assumed that the honourable member is referring to the fact that this action resulted in subscribers residing on adjoining properties who are connected to exchanges located in different charging zones being charged at different rates on calls to certain centres, for example, Bathurst. However, this situation is common throughout Australia and is in accordance with the normal zoning principles by which all call charges are determined.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) A Sydney subscriber in the inner metropolitan (02) zone has local call access to approximately 1.2 million subscribers; a Barry Exchange subscriber has local call access to 36 exchanges serving about 20,000 subscribers; and a Trunkey Creek Exchange subscriber has local call access to 18 exchanges serving more than 2,000 subscribers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Telecom recognises the community of interest between Hobby's Yards and Trunkey Creek and local call access is available between these centres. However, this community of interest has no bearing on the charges applying to calls from the Neville zone in which the Neville and Trunkey Creek exchanges are located. As indicated in the reply to (2), Telecom does not regard the situation as anomalous as charging arrangements in this area are in keeping with the general principles of zoning applied throughout Australia. Telecom does not propose to alter the zoning arrangements along the lines suggested as subscribers similarly placed in other areas would naturally want the same consideration.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. The decision by the ABC is based on the policy of providing a national television service, not a regional one. The current regional television services in Rockhampton and Townsville are the result of a decision to provide an early television service to the area. The cost of studio facilities and staff is estimated at $1,500,000 annually, which is considered a disproportionately high allocation of ABC resources to present a small amount of local television. The ABC decided that the reorganisation of the two regional studios would coincide with the conversion of its television and radio networks to a satellite distribution system. This would enable the ABC to reallocate those resources used for local program production in Rockhampton and Townsville within the new system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Senior ABC management representatives attended a meeting on 30 May 1984 in Canberra with Members of Parliament from North Queensland to explain the background and reasons for the Board's decision.
      </para>
      <para>
       ABC staff organisation and unions were informed before the decision was publicly announced. The decision will result in redeployment of staff, but not necessarily redundancies. A comprehensive retraining program will be undertaken for staff affected by the proposed changes in Rockhampton and Townsville and other centres.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. The satellite is not intended to be a means of replacing programs currently provided by the terrestrial networks but to distribute those programs more efficiently and flexibly. The ABC has made a conscious decision to increase its regional radio services through the planned second regional radio network and additional regional radio studios. There will also be an enhanced State-wide television coverage. Any change would not occur before early 1986.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. Mr Wilshire was seconded from the Amalgamated Metal Foundry and Shipwright's Union for twelve months from February 1981 to February 1982 as a Ministerial Officer, Grade II.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Mr Wilshire was appointed as a Clerk (Class 11) in the Department of Trade with effect from 27 February 1984. The advertised vacancy was not restricted to officers of the Public Service and, accordingly, the Public Service Board was represented on the selection committee. Mr Wilshire has subsequently sought promotion within the Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Following a restructuring of the Department of Trade in May 1984, a number of vacancies at various levels within the Second Division were advertised. Selection committees were formed to conduct selections for each position. Each committee generally comprised two Departmental officers and a nominee of the Public Service Board of appropriate Second Division status, depending on the level of the relevant vacancy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. Departmental selection committees are constituted to ensure that the background and experience of members are relevant to the duties, functions and responsibilities of the advertised vacancies. Representatives of the ACTU and MTIA were sought for the committee considering applicants for the newly created position of Principal Adviser, Business/Union Consultations, because of the importance of the position to the implementation of the Prices and Incomes Accord and increased emphasis within the Department on exports of manufactured goods and services. Precedents exist in relation to the participation of persons from outside the Public Service on selection committees for the filling of vacancies in the Public Service. Such instances can reflect, for example, the need to draw on special expertise and/or experience not readily available from within the Public Service.
      </para>

       (5) Yes. Amalgamated Metal Foundry and Shipwright's Union.
