                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill supports the Excise Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022 by amending the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to halve the excise-equivalent customs duty applying to imported fuels.

At the conclusion of the six months, the excise-equivalent customs duty rates will revert to the previous rates, including indexation that would have occurred on the full rates during the six-month period.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has worked with the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council and the broader Wreck Bay community over a number of years to co-design the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Amendment (Strengthening Land and Governance Provisions) Bill 2022. The bill will: strengthen the council's governance structures; enhance local control over decision-making; and help to enable homeownership style leases on Aboriginal land in the Jervis Bay Territory. The bill supports economic empowerment for the Wreck Bay community by ensuring people can access the benefits that come with homeownership and by reducing red tape in council administration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wreck Bay community is located in the Jervis Bay Territory, on the southern New South Wales coast, 126 kilometres east of Canberra. The Jervis Bay Territory was formally established in 1915, on the land of the Bherwerre Peninsula, through the enactment of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915. Of course, Aboriginal people had been living in the area since long before that time. Middens on the Bherwerre Peninsula provide evidence of thousands of generations of Indigenous occupation of the area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 1960s and 1970s, members of the community advocated for the recognition of their connection to their land in Australian law. This advocacy culminated in the enactment of the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986. The act established the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council to hold title to Aboriginal land in the Jervis Bay Territory, to manage that land for the benefit of the community and to advocate for and serve the community more generally. There have been three declarations of Aboriginal land since 1987. Today, more than 90 per cent of the land in the Jervis Bay Territory is Aboriginal land owned and managed by the council. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures that the council is well positioned to hold and manage this land for the benefit of the Wreck Bay community for generations to come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enhances local control over decision-making by increasing the amount the council can agree to spend under a contract without obtaining ministerial approval. This amount will increase from $100,000 to $1 million, empowering the council to pursue commercial ventures without having to navigate unnecessary red tape. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill assists the council to issue homeownership-style leases to individuals in the community. If community members wish to do so, they will be able to take out a homeownership-style lease. This will simplify arrangements for long-term leasing and provide opportunity for community members to enjoy the intergenerational benefits associated with homeownership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill strengthens the council's governance structures, aligning them more closely with those of comparable corporate Commonwealth entities. The powers of the council will be vested in the board; until now, the council's members have had to delegate powers to the board, creating uncertainty within the council. The board and the chief executive officer will be explicitly empowered to delegate functions and powers so the council can function effectively. The bill also ensures only fit and proper persons may serve on the board and changes quorum requirements from set numbers to percentages of overall members, ensuring responsiveness to changes in overall membership numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill updates the title of the act to the Aboriginal Land and Waters (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986. This name reflects the council's ownership of an area of the waters of Jervis Bay as well as freshwater sources across the Jervis Bay Territory. It recognises the community's strong connection to waters as well as land and the importance of the act in supporting that enduring connection into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's closing the gap commitment to shared decision-making has guided the development of this package of reforms. I am proud to say the bill has been co-designed with the council and community over a number of years. Targeted co-design sessions were held in 2020 and 2021, including with the board, men's and women's groups, subcommittees, elders, youth and the broader membership. Some reforms were proposed by the community, others were suggested by government, and every reform in this bill has been explicitly endorsed by the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government sincerely thanks the council for its work in the co-design of this bill. In particular, we acknowledge the leadership of Annette Brown and Julie Moore, who have chaired the council during the co-design process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The council's work honours the longstanding tradition of community service and representation in Wreck Bay. Those who advocated for land rights in the 20th century paved the way for the present generation to maintain their deep connection to their land and waters. This bill ensures that the Wreck Bay community will continue to live their culture through this enduring connection for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

This unanimity continues a very long practice of Labor and coalition members of both houses of this parliament who have been members of the Intelligence and Security Committee since its establishment more than 20 years ago. Members of the Labor Party in this parliament and coalition members of this parliament, in seeking to reach unanimity on reports concerning our national security, on intelligence and security matters, are reflecting the long-held position of the Australian Labor Party and the long-held position of the coalition parties in this parliament that national security is important, that we have a very, very important task of keeping our communities safe and that unanimity between the party of government and the party of opposition is an important value in order to build confidence in the national security arrangements of our country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the first report, which relates to the listings of Hezbollah and the Base as terrorist organisations, I echo the words of the chair of the committee, Senator James Paterson, who said, 'My Labor colleagues and I welcome the fact that the Morrison government has accepted the committee's earlier bipartisan recommendation to list the whole organisation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, for many years, this listing was limited to Hezbollah's external security organisation, a suborganisation of Hezbollah operating under the military wing of that organisation. However, as I said in this place when I spoke on the tabling of the intelligence and security committee's previous report in relation to the government's desire to partially list only the external security organisation, this position was no longer tenable, if it ever was. The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the Arab League all list the entirety of Hezbollah, including its military wing, as a terrorist organisation. This is because Hezbollah is a unitary organisation, and it cannot be realistically or reasonably subdivided into different parts, only one of which is said to be a listed terrorist organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned last year when I spoke about the government's decision to relist Hezbollah's external security organisation as a terrorist organisation that I have visited the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina, a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires, on more than one occasion. In 1994, a van loaded with explosives was driven into that building by a suicide bomber, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds more. All of the evidence from multiple inquiries points to Iran and Hezbollah being responsible for that bombing and the murder of 85 people, and I do not understand why it should matter what part of Hezbollah carried out this devastating attack against the Jewish community in Buenos Aires and against the Argentinian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the United Kingdom moved from listing only the military wing of Hezbollah to the whole of the organisation. In announcing the decision in the House of Commons on 26 February 2019, the United Kingdom Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There have long been calls to ban the whole group, with the distinction between the two factions derided as smoke and mirrors. Hezbollah itself has laughed off the suggestion that there is a difference. I have carefully considered the evidence and I am satisfied that they are one and the same, with the entire organisation being linked to terrorism…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government have continued to call on Hezbollah to end its armed status; it has not listened. Indeed, its behaviour has escalated; the distinction between its political and military wings is now untenable. It is right that we act now to proscribe this entire organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those were the words of the United Kingdom Minister Sajid Javid in 2019, and they remain true today. It has taken the Australian government three years to reach the same conclusion, but I welcome the fact that it has done so. I commend my colleagues—all my colleagues: the six coalition members and the four Labor colleagues in addition to myself—on the Intelligence and Security Committee; I commend my colleagues for leading the government in this direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming to the next report, I've already spoken in this place on the critical infrastructure protection bill and, given the time constraints, I'll keep my remarks short. This is an important bill on an important subject. The Intelligence and Security Committee completed its review of the original version of the Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill 2020 last year and recommended that the original bill be split into two. The committee recommended that the parts of the bill that had been identified as urgent pass the parliament without delay, and the other parts of the bill could be reconsidered and redrafted in light of the committee's comments and feedback from key stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a very unusual position for the Intelligence and Security Committee to take on a government bill but shows the care with which the committee goes about its work. The parts of the Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill 2020 that the Department of Home Affairs identified as urgent did pass the parliament last year with bipartisan support following a number of amendments that the government, quite properly, made to implement recommendations to the Intelligence and Security Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure Protection) Bill 2022 consists of the remaining elements of the original bill. As will be evident to anyone who reads the committee's bipartisan report, the committee as a whole remains concerned about aspects of this bill. In particular, we remain concerned that the government has failed to consult adequately with critical infrastructure industry representatives, relevant employee representative bodies, and trade unions. It's particularly disappointing that there should have been such a failure of consultation when this is the government's second attempt to get this legislation right and much comment was made by the committee in its previous report when it recommended that the former singular bill be split into two on the need for consultation, given the fact that this legislation potentially affects hundreds or possibly thousands of commercial organisations and certainly thousands if not hundreds of thousands of workers across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But all the committee members also, right now, recognise the importance of the bill, and we agree that on balance it is better that the bill be passed in its current form now than be delayed until after the election. The regulation arrangements for the security of critical infrastructure is too important a matter to be left hanging, and that's why there will be bipartisan support for this bill. It is just a crying shame that the government has once again left something this important until the last minute, before an election, thus depriving the parliament and itself of the opportunity to work through the issues that have been identified in a careful and methodical way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly—and it's a very unusual recommendation—the Intelligence and Security Committee has recommended that the government commission an independent review of the operation of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 after one year of operation after the bill receives royal assent. It is very unusual for the committee to recommend a review of legislation so soon after its passage. We've done so because the government has left this until the last minute and has clearly failed to address many of the concerns the committee expressed in its previous report about security of critical infrastructure and indeed—as was apparent from the hearing conducted by the committee and the many submissions the committee received on this bill—has failed to address a number of cogent concerns expressed by many interested people and interested organisations in the Australian community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning into the inquiry into national security risks affecting the Australian higher education and research sector, the committee has made a number of unanimous, modest and sensible recommendations to address the existing, and, it must be said, evolving national security risks and threats to the Australian higher education and research sector. I commend the report to the parliament. I commend it, indeed, to the wider Australian community. It's a very important matter that is dealt with in this report. The committee acknowledges at some length the importance of the higher education and research sector, including international research and collaboration. At paragraphs 6.15 to 6.17 of the committee's report, for example, the report notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6.15 The Committee noted evidence highlighting the importance of the sector, its contributions to Australian society more broadly and the importance of international engagement by universities. International research and collaboration—within reason—is a critical part of the Australian economy and society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6.16 The Committee believes the independence of the sector is critical. Australian universities and research institutions hold entrenched freedoms that allow high quality research and democratic debate of ideas. This is important for both staff and students within the sector. The Australian higher education system plays an important role in Australian public life. The importance of freedom of speech on campuses, international research relationships and collaboration is critical. This independence is at risk though as national security threats can erode it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6.17 The Committee notes that the sector plays a critical role in Australian society both economically and intellectually. The Committee accepted evidence that national security and academic integrity are not zero sum concepts. National security and academic integrity are mutually reinforcing and critical for a prosperous Australian society. The sector indicated its acknowledgement of the importance of national security, and the national security bodies indicated their support for academic independence and freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has produced a relatively lengthy and thoughtful report, and I do commend it to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the fourth and final of the reports that I am tabling today on behalf of the committee, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Advisory report on the National Sec</span><span style="font-style:italic;">urity Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 1) Bill 2021</span>, that bill is listed for debate later today. I will reserve my comments until we debate the bill, save to say that this bill is an implementation of a small number of the recommendations made by the eminent Australian Dennis Richardson in his Comprehensive Review of the Legal Framework of the National Intelligence Community, delivered to the government in December 2020, and some of the recommendations made by the Independent Intelligence Review, conducted by, delivered to the government in 2017. There remain outstanding recommendations of the Merchant and L'Estrange review, and there were 203 recommendations made by Mr Richardson, and very, very many of them are still to be dealt with. This bill, as the committee's report makes clear, deals with some quite pressing legislative amendments that are needed to deal with a confined number of situations that potentially the intelligence agencies are faced with, and I will have more to say later in the debate on this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, could I thank the staff of the committee for the truly excellent work that they have carried out during the term of this parliament, producing very, very many high-quality reports of the intelligence and security committee. I thank all of my colleagues on the intelligence and security committee for their work over the term of this parliament and I thank both of the chairs of the committee during this term, Mr Andrew Hastie, the member for Canning, and Senator James Paterson, senator for Victoria, who took over as chair when Mr Hastie was elevated to the ministry. In particular, I would pay special tribute and thanks to Senator Paterson for the difficult task that he faced of taking over the chairing of a very, very busy committee with very many reports not yet completed on inquiries that he had not served on, and he has done a very good job over the balance of the term in landing a very large number of those uncompleted inquiries and reports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is complex and has many schedules and a lot of mechanical provisions which provide the enabling I have just described. There have also been other measures that were in the bill as it was originally submitted to the parliament, particularly schedule 8, which got the government a saving of $192 million at the last budget—by 'the last budget' I mean the 2021 budget—very much at the expense of those recipients in the system who, as a result of schedule 8, would have been required to wait longer on average before their first payment became due. That's how the government saved that money. Labour was opposed to that and sought amendments to that, and ultimately those amendments are now occurring today, with that schedule being removed from the bill. It was the most significant example of the concerns that we had with this bill initially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of other elements that we were concerned about in a context where the best use of technology is very important, but it needs to be used in a way which is fair and ethical. Making sure there are proper codes of conduct and that they have legal force is critical in terms of making sure that that technology operates in the most fair way. That has been a concern to many within the sector. I note that the government, the opposition and those in the sector have been engaged in conversations around that which have led to amendments which are being pursued by the minister. We acknowledge the spirit in which that has been done and we thank the minister for that. To that end, Labor will support the bill as amended when the government amendments have been put before the House. As the second reading amendment makes clear, we're not declining to give the bill the second reading in that sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important amendments to make sure that there is the best use of technology from 1 July but also that there is the appropriate framework around that to make sure that it can operate in a manner which is safe, which is ethical and which places those who are seeking employment front and centre. There remain many in that category. Yes, we are at a point in time where the headline unemployment figure is low, but there are still 1½ million Australians who are either unemployed or underemployed who are looking for work. We still have a real issue around the number of long-term unemployed people, those who are unemployed for more than a year, which our economy is generating. It's really important that we are not building an economy which is leaving people behind. Labor is very concerned that that is what is happening right now. In those circumstances, we need to make sure that there is an employment system which operates in a way to best provide opportunities for those people to re-enter the workforce. That is where Labor is focused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge the efforts in the last 48 hours to reach agreements around amendments which enable Labor to be in a position of, ultimately, supporting this. We acknowledge the effort that has gone into making sure that those within the sector are also comfortable with what is now being moved through the parliament. To that end, we thank the minister for his efforts. But we do also make clear that making sure that our system is at world's best practice when it comes to those who are seeking employment is absolutely paramount to making sure that we are not leaving people behind within our economy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2021 and the amendment that we have moved. Labor fully understands the value and the positive impact of our social security system. It is fundamentally important to us alleviating poverty and having an egalitarian society that we support people who are unable to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we have over a million Australians who are out of work or looking for more work. It is not the time to be making it harder for them. Any Australian who has found themselves out of work and has to rely on our system, and on Services Australia and Centrelink's administration of that, needs to know that this is a system that will actually support them to be able to live with dignity and to be able to find a job. In fact, our social security system should be a source of national pride like universal health care and public education. It has been fundamental to making Australia a relatively egalitarian society. It is something that we should take pride in and ensure that the policy settings around it enable it to be an effective system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, so much of our social security system is inadequate and so much of the way that it is administered is problematic. But we called upon that system to catch so many Australians when we were hit by mass job losses when the pandemic hit in early 2020. And we saw the power of that system, as we were able to reduce the level of poverty in Australia when the government significantly increased the JobSeeker payment temporarily. We saw people lining up around the streets in scenes reminiscent of the Great Depression, needing to access that support and those payments, and needing to access them in person, in particular. We saw long lines of people stretching out the doors of Centrelink shopfronts around the country, as workers were left jobless. The Centrelink in Braddon—which no longer exists—in my electorate of Canberra was no exception. There were long lines outside it as people went there to seek help, having lost their jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, research done by the Australian National University confirmed that, when those payments were increased with the coronavirus supplement, hundreds of thousands of Australians were lifted out of poverty. That is the sort of thing we should be looking at doing. But, when the payment was first reduced and then cancelled completely, those same Australians were pushed back into poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another really important aspect of that support was that it enabled people to be at home and stop the spread of COVID. So we also relied on that system as a health measure—to support people to be able to live safely and to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to this bill, which relates to the 2021-22 budget measure, the new employment services model, which comprises spending of $700 million over five years and savings of over $1.1 billion over four years from 2021-22. The bill introduces changes to mutual obligation arrangements which would achieve $191.6 million in savings over four years by delaying when jobseekers receive payments. This is the sort of policy that we're looking at under this government—making a saving by just delaying when people can receive payments. You really would like to see your parliament doing much better than this. It introduces changes to participation requirements as part of the new employment services model announced in the budget, which had significant implications for jobseekers. These changes need to be considered so no Australians are left behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been mentioned, we are concerned that the government is rushing this bill through parliament, hence we have moved these amendments. That is why we referred the bill to a Senate inquiry in the first place, which reported in June last year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard nothing from the employment minister that offers confidence to anyone looking for a job, particularly the long-term unemployed, that this government is on their side. In fact, in the course of the Senate inquiry, the National Employment Services Association submitted 'there has likely been a considerable reduction in investment' for disadvantaged jobseekers. There are almost 1.5 million jobseekers, thousands of workers and hundreds of providers and businesses who are part of the employment services sector, and these changes are too important not to get right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is concerned that schedule 8 of the bill would mean that about 144,000 new jobseekers could lose between $300 and $450 in payments a year because of changes to when they would start receiving payments. It's a very sneaky way to save money—targeting the most vulnerable, targeting people that Australian society should be supporting, when they have lost their jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This cut in payments is linked to when a jobseeker is able to enter into an employment plan. Under schedule 8, new jobseekers who use online services would be disadvantaged compared to those who choose face-to-face services, which means they could wait up to 10 days before they receive their first payment. This is a very strange potential outcome of this bill, in that what Services Australia and Centrelink are aiming to do is encourage people online, but this actually creates a disincentive for people to go online. As mentioned, we are concerned, because, while technology is important and we should be utilising it as much as we can, we need to use it in the best possible way, in ways that don't actually increase hardship for people who have lost their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is: how can jobseekers choose face-to-face services when this government has been steadily axing Centrelink shopfronts around the country? I know this because it happened in my electorate of Canberra just recently. Last year the only Centrelink shopfront in my electorate, in central Canberra, was shut at short notice. This was in the middle of a pandemic, when, as I mentioned earlier, we had seen hundreds of people lining up in the street in Braddon when the pandemic hit, wanting to access that service. A replacement service will not be opened in my electorate. Services Australia claimed that the office was shut because of a 40 per cent drop in customer demand since 2016 as a result of demographic changes in the area, and this came out only through questioning by Senator Gallagher in Senate estimates. Despite this decrease, the Braddon shopfront was still used by 27,000 people every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The secretive nature of the closure was also very concerning. I found out about this planned closure only after chancing upon a Facebook ad for the office space and confirming that it was in fact the Centrelink office space that was being advertised. Despite huge community support for the service remaining open, with next to no community consultation from the government, they went ahead and axed the shopfront anyway. The thousands of customers who have been told to instead use online portals or visit shopfronts in Gungahlin, Belconnen and Woden had barely any notice and no consultation on that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not everyone can use online services. Not everyone has a computer or a smartphone. And many of Centrelink's own requirements need you to come in, and this is a perfect example of that—where people will actually be worse off if they use the online option rather than coming in, but their options to come in are extremely limited. The closure forced people to travel to Belconnen, Woden or Gungahlin to access face-to-face services, and my constituents who are struggling to survive on the disgraceful $43-a-day Jobseeker payment will have to spend a significant portion of that very low income on transport to get there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The illogical aspect of this bill is that, despite closing shopfronts and pushing customers online, if jobseekers are forced to use online services they could be, on average, at least 8.4 days of pay worse off than jobseekers who use face-to-face services. At a time when the government is closing shopfronts to cut costs, this bill will act as a disincentive for jobseekers to utilise online employment services and appears to be at odds with the objectives of the new employment services model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor recognises that the current employment services system is in need of reform. We are not opposed to changes designed to improve the system to make the best use of available technology for the benefit of jobseekers. That is why Labor will support the bill only if schedule 8 is removed and amendments are made as negotiated with the Australian Council of Social Service. These amendments include protections for jobseekers who are principal carer parents or have a partial capacity to work and a digital code of ethics to protect people from automated decisions and to protect privacy. I note that while the government have advised that they are prepared to remove schedule 8 from the bill they have not reversed this policy. This has again proved that Labor is the only party that can deliver fairer employment services.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2021, but before I get into the bill, I just want to congratulate my elderly mother, who yesterday managed to FaceTime me for my birthday. It's a huge achievement for her, but it speaks very much to what the member for Canberra was just a saying in relation to the closure of face-to-face Centrelink offices as well as other Commonwealth offices and the ability of people like my mother, who is a pensioner, to access services through digital pathways. My mother has just learned, as I mentioned, to use FaceTime. But it is highly unlikely that she would use online platforms or gateways to access government services. She, like many other pensioners, relies on that face-to-face service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2021. This bill introduces changes to mutual obligation arrangements as part of a move to a new model that incorporates digital services. Those who have spoken before me have noted that there is a particular schedule within this bill that is particularly affronting, and that is the inclusion of schedule 8. To my mind, schedule 8—and the inclusion of schedule 8 in this bill in the very first place—speaks volumes about this government and its agenda. Schedule 8 could be described as a budget saving measure that saves money by targeting the most vulnerable. We're concerned that schedule 8 of the bill would mean that, in a given year, around 144,000 new jobseekers could lose between $300 and $450 in payments because, within schedule 8, there are changes to the start date for receiving payments. The reduction in payments is linked to when a jobseeker is able to enter into an employment plan, which means that new jobseekers who use online services will be disadvantaged compared to those who choose to use face-to-face services even though there are fewer Centrelink offices—fewer options—for face-to-face service delivery. As the member for Canberra mentioned, with the cost of petrol being what it is, the cost of transport or driving to a face-to-face appointment for many people on a fixed or low income can be quite prohibitive. They could wait up to 10 days before getting their first payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been in that position. I've had to walk into a Centrelink office after fleeing a violent marriage. I remember walking into that office with my two babies. I remember the humiliation; I remember how depressing it was. I remember sitting in front of a bureaucrat, like many of the other bureaucrats that were there, doing the best they could with the resources they had. I remember being told that it would take five weeks before I could get a payment. I remember breaking down in tears and saying to this man, 'How am I going to feed my children for five weeks?' Imagine, through no circumstances under your own control, if you had to wait 10 days to get any kind of payment from a government that should be there to look after you when you are at your most vulnerable, in your greatest time of need. It's just cruel; that's what it is. It's cruel to deliberately write into legislation something that makes people have to wait 10 days to get a payment. It's cruel because it makes them wonder, as I did at that point in time, how they're going to feed their children, pay their rent, put petrol in their car and live. Ten days may not seem a long time, but, let me tell you, when you go to your bank account and your balance is minus $6, 10 days is an eternity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peak bodies have also raised their concerns about schedule 8 of the bill. Indeed, the National Employment Services Association have said that they're supportive of the bill should schedule 8 be removed. Although we have some indication that there is some willingness or preparation to remove schedule 8 from the bill, we're yet to see a reversal of the inclusion of this policy within the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with many members here, I imagine, a great bulk of the workload in my office is devoted to people who come in who have had issues dealing with Centrelink and job service providers. Some of the most heartbreaking stories that have been shared with me, which I have had the privilege of hearing, come from people who have had some fairly heart-wrenching experiences with Centrelink, with the system and with job providers, particularly where they have a disability that prevents them from meeting their obligation to report on a fortnightly basis. In fact, I believe it was just a couple of weeks ago, when I was out doorknocking, that I met a woman with a daughter who was on JobSeeker and who suffered from some fairly severe health conditions—multiple health conditions, as a matter of fact. Although this young woman should be living her best life, a full and vibrant life, as all of us deserve, even her doctor said that this young woman had so many health ailments that it really was impossible for her to hold down employment, yet she was required to report every two weeks in order to continue to receive JobKeeper. Her mother, who is her main carer, was just beside herself about how the system had treated her daughter and about her own frustrations in dealing with the system on behalf of her daughter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I came here, as I imagine many of us did, because I wanted to make sure that the people I represent, and indeed the broader community of Australians, don't go through these kinds of things—that they have a government they can turn to and trust in their time of need. I know that all of us, from both sides, are dedicated to this mission of ensuring that we look after everyone and that nobody is left behind. It doesn't matter what side of the aisle you sit on in this place. From my personal interactions with people on all sides, I believe in my heart that every single one of us is here because, fundamentally, we care about the people we represent. If we care about the people we represent, then we should ensure that the policies and the legislation that we pass do not disadvantage them in any way. Unfortunately, this bill, particularly schedule 8, does that. It creates a disadvantage where a disadvantage does not need to exist. That's the main point here. It doesn't have to create this disadvantage. This disadvantage doesn't need to be there. This bill actually creates it. It creates a gap where there doesn't need to be a gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'm going to reiterate what my colleagues on this side of the House have said about this bill and our position, which echoes the position of experts, the position of ACOSS and the position of peak bodies. We will support this bill if we have an assurance about schedule 8, which in its application is quite cruel, which in its application creates disadvantage and which in its application creates more hardship for the people we are supposed to be here for. If schedule 8 is removed then we will support this bill. I urge those on the other side to stand up. Stand up and remember those you represent, and think about the impact that this bill would have on them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  I thank everyone who has contributed to the bill. I especially thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Corio, for his constructive leadership and for working with me, to his enduring credit. This bill modernises and streamlines social security law by reducing duplication and enabling jobseekers who are job-ready the opportunity to self-manage their pathway to work using a digital platform, giving them more flexibility and more choice. It enables a key element of the new employment services model known as Workforce Australia. Workforce Australia aligns with the recommendations from the Employment Services Expert Advisory Panel's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">I want to work</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Employment Services 2020</span>, which was the result of extensive consultation with stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Current social security law is constraining the government's ability to provide the best service to jobseekers. For example, jobseekers who want to enter study or training into their job plan need to call the digital services contact centre to talk to a human delegate. It's an unnecessary burden on the hundreds of thousands of jobseekers who are job-ready and who can and should be able to manage their requirements online. Having to contact a government call centre may also deter some jobseekers from accessing activities that are beneficial to them. Once passed, the changes in the bill will give jobseekers the option to enter activities into their plan online without talking to a human delegate, reducing the administrative burden on those seeking work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth clarifying that the amendments do not mean that employment services or approving plans will be automated or that jobseekers will be forced into a digital-only pathway. Human oversight and assistance will remain an integral part of all employment services. At any time, a jobseeker can contact a person in the digital services contact centre for assistance or opt out of online employment services and agree to their job plan with a delegate at an employment services provider. In addition, it's an overarching principle of the administration of the social security law that services must be delivered fairly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobseekers using online employment services are also covered by extensive existing legislation regarding privacy and the protection of personal information. But, responding to stakeholder concerns, the government has agreed to make amendments to require a digital protections framework be contained in a legislative instrument, providing greater assurance that employment services are indeed administered ethically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will streamline and reduce the complexity of social security law to better support the transparency and administration of existing mutual obligation policy and ensure the legislation is fit for purpose now and in the future. It'll do this by consolidating repetitive provisions and removing redundant and outdated provisions. Crucially, existing protections in the law will be retained; however, the government has agreed to strengthen these protections by removing amendments to the bill to ensure that jobseekers who are the principal carer of a child or have a partial capacity to work cannot be penalised for refusing work of more than 15 hours per week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry into the bill was that guidance be published on certain aspects of how jobseekers may meet their mutual obligation requirements and information that must be provided to them. While this guidance is largely already public, to provide additional clarity and assurance to stakeholders the government has agreed to move amendments to require a legislative instrument be made, including this guidance. The government has also agreed to move amendments to require arrangements so jobseekers are not disadvantaged by the transition to points based activation under Workforce Australia. In practice, the amendments will have the effect that, during the transition to Workforce Australia, jobseekers will not face compliance action for failing to meet a points requirement as part of the new points based activation framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment to require completion of a comprehensive review of Workforce Australia within two years of the commencement of the program will ensure that the effectiveness of the new model is thoroughly and transparently examined. The review will include consideration of jobseeker experiences as described by jobseekers themselves. It will also include qualitative and quantitative data and input from employment service providers, key stakeholders such as employers, and social security experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 of the bill, as it was introduced, includes amendments supporting the 2021-22 budget measure to align payment commencement for jobseekers referred to online services for those who are referred to a provider. Stakeholders have expressed concern that the current measures under schedule 8 will have adverse impacts on jobseekers. It's important to note that protections within schedule 8 would ensure that jobseekers do not face delays in payment for reasons beyond their control. However, the government does not wish the passage of other important improvements to social security law to be delayed, including changes to support the new model. Accordingly, the government has agreed to move amendments to remove schedule 8 from the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other changes to the bill include a minor amendment to clarify the existing policy that certain Commonwealth workplace laws do not apply in relation to a person's participation in Commonwealth employment programs; providing more transparent legislative authority for employment programs; enabling quicker implementation when employment programs are modified or new programs introduced; removing the word 'must' from provisions in the targeted compliance framework and instead referring to circumstances in which a person may be subject to compliance action to better reflect the operational policy; ensuring that employment services assistance is not counted as income under social security law; clarifying that the approved program of work delegation is a legislative instrument; clarifying arrangements for youth allowance recipients who are undertaking study as a jobseeker; and tidying up social security law by making other technical amendments and removing redundant provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I again thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for a very constructive engagement between our offices in relation to the bill and associated amendments, and I thank him and the opposition for their support for the revised bill. The bill will significantly modernise and streamline social security law, whilst maintaining existing protections, and provide critical support for the new employment services model. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I rise in support of the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021 and I wish to take the opportunity to speak on the importance of this legislation to my electorate of Mayo. I've often said in this place that my electorate, the electorate of Mayo, has the oldest median age out of all the electorates in South Australia, one of the oldest in the nation. We have many retirees, both self-funded pensioners and part pensioners. Our retirees have worked tirelessly to prepare themselves for retirement, but for many the increased cost of living has made retirement challenging. This is a time when retirees should be living in comfort and not wondering how they can make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide Australians over the age of 65 with more flexibility to unlock equity in their homes to generate additional retirement income, through fortnightly loan amounts and lump sum advances. No negative equity guarantee provides certainty that upon settling the debt individuals will not repay more than the equity in the property used to secure their loan, combined with the reduction in interest rates from 4.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent from January this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I can appreciate that many in the sector, including National Seniors, are appreciative of the 3.9 per cent interest rate, I still believe that is far too high when we look at the official interest rates in this nation. It's my hope that more single homeowners should be able to achieve a high standard of living by tapping into their home equity. These changes to the pension loan scheme and guarantee will make retirement living more sustainable. However, there is much more that we need to do as a nation to improve the standards of living for those who are no longer of working age. For example, our aged citizens are required to navigate the impersonal telephone system, where a call to Services Australia is met with a recorded directory assistant. This telephone lottery requires the caller to listen to a number of options and then follow a convoluted path of numerous menus in the hope that a category will address their question. Invariably, the menu doesn't cover the question, nor is it clear to the caller, and it creates stress and frustration. Our seniors worked during a period when personal service was fundamental to good government and business practice and they deserve this experience in retirement. Confusing telephone systems, automated telephone systems and this continual forcing of older people onto the internet and websites that take the user on a circular journey is just not good enough. A retiree should be able to call and have a real person answer the phone and get an actual answer. They deserve a service which is designed to meet their needs, not the faceless, unfriendly and anonymous delivery system that is currently provided. Whether you are looking for My Aged Care or Centrelink, it is all the same. It is frustrating and many don't call again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to overhaul the earning capacity restrictions for pensioners with a view to creating more flexibility and increasing the cap on how much they can earn so that pensioners are not penalised for working a few extra hours. Each day, thousands of senior Australians make their way across the country, often visiting regions that are desperate for workers yet many are not able to work, as doing so will reduce their pension entitlements significantly and the process of dealing with sporadic employment through the Centrelink system is cumbersome. It is a real disincentive and an enormous loss to the productivity of our regions everywhere. There are many pensioners who wish to remain in part-time employment or work additional hours but, because of the corresponding reduction in pension, it is simply not worth their while. Essentially, it is akin to being taxed at 50 per cent. Similarly, we have pensioner couples where a partner is unable to work due to illness or disability and current criteria do not allow for work earnings to be shared across both parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides a framework to enable retired and semi-retired Australians to improve their living standards by accessing equity in property. As not all retirees have equity in property, we need to look at another suite of options, including ones I have mentioned here, to allow pension-age Australians to live their lives with dignity. I have to say, we are looking at this and asking pensioners to use up the equity in their home but what we are not doing is looking at the actual pension amount and that is what we need to be doing. We also need to look at lifting the Commonwealth rent assistant amount for pensioners. There are too many, particularly older women, living alone on the pension, renting the property that they are in. They don't have any capacity for home ownership, their rent is increasing significantly, particularly this year, and there is nowhere else to live because vacancy rates are at zero in some parts of Australia. Particularly in my electorate, they are incredibly low. I think we can be doing far more for older Australians in this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021. It is an important scheme, the Pension Loans Scheme. It allows older people in our community who are asset rich but income poor to have a source of income. But like everything under this government, it has been botched, and now we are dealing with a bill that attempts to fix a couple of problems in the dying embers of this parliament just so the Morrison government can say: 'Look at us. We have done something for pensioners.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You may know, Deputy Speaker Andrews, that the Pension Loans Scheme, the PLS, is a legacy of the Hawke government. I'm not sure if you were here that early, Deputy Speaker. I know you've been in this place a long time. It's a legacy of the Hawke government. Its purpose was to enhance the living standards of senior Australians who were unable to access the age pension because they were unable to meet the income test. The scheme, however, has very low take-up rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many barriers preventing Australians from accessing the program. Equality of access, complexity of financial products, unintended consequences of safeguards against excessive debt, interest rates and cultural issues come into play. The government made some modest changes in the 2018-19 budget, which expanded the eligibility to full-rate pensioners and self-funded retirees, increasing the maximum fortnightly payment rate under the Pension Loans Scheme from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of the full pension and reducing the interest rate from 5.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. We supported those changes, and we welcome the government's efforts to further improve the PLS. Senior Australians have waited far too long for the government to address the known barriers to accessing the program. And still, many remain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only last year when I spoke on addressing pension portability, meaning pensioners would be able to retain the full rate overseas for longer than 26 weeks. If they were to travel overseas they wouldn't have it cut off. Specifically, increasing the number of countries we have social security agreements with will ensure that Australians are able to receive their pensions while they are travelling overseas, when they start travelling again. Flexibility is important in decision-making, and that's why Labor supports this bill. This bill expands the scheme further, introducing more financial safeguards and greater payment flexibility. It allows two annual advance lump sum payments to help participants with larger expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As always with this government, they've focused on the marketing effort, giving the scheme a new name. They've called it the Home Equity Access Scheme. This scheme, allowing people to unlock their housing assets to improve their retirement incomes, should be fair and easy to access for all senior Australians. This bill is another missed opportunity to introduce significant and real change. It's a job half done, taken up too late. Too little, too late. There are still cultural barriers yet to be addressed by this government. Only then will we see real change in the take-up rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, this government would prefer to have done nothing and been left unbothered by the challenges of the people it's meant to represent. The government can't claim to be giving senior Australians real choices in their retirement without addressing these particular barriers. There are still many older Australians unable to access the program despite owning real property. For instance, many tens of thousands of Australians live in land lease communities. These Australians own their own homes, but because they do not own the land they are unable to access the scheme. That's unfair. The government must look at this issue, make further changes and open the scheme up for those Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, to be fair, although there are some positive changes to the PLS in this bill that do assist older Australians—and that's why we're supporting it—I don't think pensioners will be fooled by this government and what they're trying to do here. They won't forget the shameful track record of cuts and attempted cuts to the pension, making it more difficult for pensioners to access Centrelink. In a speech back in 2015, a freshly minted Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, made comments stating that the age pension should not be regarded as an entitlement for all. Just let that sink in. It should not be regarded as an entitlement for all. The then Treasurer also outlined the Turnbull government's vision for an overhaul of the country's retirement income system by both reducing expenditure on welfare payments and limiting the amount of revenue forgone through tax concessions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, you know, and most of us who represent our communities know, that the vast majority of pensioners have worked very hard throughout their working lives, and they've contributed all of their lives. They've paid their taxes. It's not just because of their age that they deserve respect and dignity in their retirement. It's because of that commitment, that social contract. They've paid their taxes. They've paid their dues. They've contributed to this country. So we have an obligation to give them respect and dignity in their retirement but also to fulfil our side of that contract. Many of those in the firing line of the coalition's many attempts to cut the pension are migrants. These are migrants who came to this country 40 or 50 years ago, who worked very hard to build a new life for themselves and their children and who have contributed into building Australia up into the great country that it is today. They're now pensioners. They're at retirement age. They worked hard, they paid their taxes and they built their lives and their families here. They're people who helped make this country what it is today. Those people should be able to receive a pension that allows them to at least live comfortably and in dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of many of the recent instances where the government have tried to get their scissors out and start cutting, start undercutting and start diminishing their side of the commitment of this contract. In 2015 the Prime Minister, when he was doing such a fantastic job as Treasurer, tried to cut the pension and increase the age of entitlement. In the 2014 budget, the government tried to cut the pension indexation, a cut that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within 10 years. This unfair cut would have ripped $23 billion from the pockets of every single pensioner in Australia over that period. In the 2014 budget, the government cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions, support that was designed to help pensioners with the cost of living—and wouldn't that be handy now for those pensioners? In the 2014 budget, the government axed the $900 senior supplement for self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card. That infamous budget also saw the government try to reset deeming rate thresholds, a cut that would have seen 500,000 part pensioners made worse off. In 2015 the Liberals did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension of around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension assets test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2016 budget, the government tried to cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks, which I referred to earlier: the portability issue. In the 2016 budget, they also tried to cut the pension for over 1½ million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. The government's own figures show that this would have left over 563,000 Australians who are currently receiving a pension or allowance worse off. In 10 years this would be in excess of 1.5 million pensioners. In August 2020, more recently, the government was caught out by Labor on its pensions freeze for 2½ million pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners will not be surprised to hear that the coalition has tried to cut their pension this many times, again and again, over the past nine years. The government's obsessed with it. They've tried to do this in every single budget. Cutting the pension, unfortunately, is in the government's DNA; building and supporting the pension is in Labor's DNA. When we were last in government, we increased the pension by $30 a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen stagnant wages, the slowest growth in a decade, productivity in decline and the cost of living going up, all under the coalition government. The Morrison government likes to do a bit of a smoke and mirrors act to pretend to care about cost-of-living pressures because, guess what, the election is around the corner. It's going to be called within a week or so. If they really cared about cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, they wouldn't have spent the last decade attacking wages, job security, pensions and Medicare. The government has no plans to turn the economy around. They're just paying out with handouts. The billions of dollars that Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister; and Josh Frydenberg, the Treasurer, spray around in this budget won't change the reality for Australians that everything is going up except their pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The age pension is a proud Labor legacy introduced decades ago to ensure older Australians could live with dignity. It was doubled by the Whitlam Labor government in 1972 and increased again by the Hawke and Keating governments. The changes have been enormous, but the principle of giving older Australians security, support and dignity remain the cornerstone of the system. That is the Australian way, and it's always been the Labor way—to meet our obligation to those Australians who've made that contribution throughout their working lives, who've worked hard, whether it's the pension, Medicare, unemployment benefits when they can't find a job and they're looking, superannuation, the NDIS. These are the sorts of era-defining policies that Australians can actually trust the Labor Party to deliver. These are the kinds of policies that the Liberal Party, in contrast, for some reason, hate. They are always trying to knock down, diminish, destroy, slash and cut at the earliest opportunity, much like we have seen in the pattern of this current government over the past nine years. Australians expect better from their government, and I am sure they're pleased that there is an election coming so that they can make their own choice. </span>

The Australian government announced measures to further enhance the flexibility of the Pension Loans Scheme in the 2021-22 budget. The Pension Loans Scheme enables senior Australians of age pension age to supplement their retirement income by increasing the equity in their home. This bill will introduce to the Pension Loans Scheme a no negative equity guarantee, which means that participants will not need to repay more than the equity in their property used to secure their loan when settling their debt. The guarantee is in addition to the strong safeguards already in place to minimise the chance of someone's debt ever exceeding their equity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also introduces the option for Pension Loans Scheme participants to access a portion of their annual loan payment, usually received as a fortnightly instalment, as a capped lump sum advance. This bill demonstrates the government is continuing to support senior Australians by providing them with greater flexibility in how they draw on their real estate assets to support their living standards in retirement if they choose to do so. To complement the changes made to the Pension Loans Scheme through this bill, the government will also raise awareness of the Pension Loans Scheme so senior Australians are aware of all the options they have to improve their living standards in retirement. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many ways to measure the success of our country and society. Ultimately the measure of our shared humanity is the support we provide to those who do the quiet, difficult and remarkable things that make the lives of those around them happier and more fulfilling. Of all the measures in every budget handed down by governments of both persuasions, those are the ones which show our strength as a country, an economy and a society. That is our view. It is the predominant view of our country because it is so obviously the right thing for us to do as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a view shared by those opposite. Those opposite see supporting their fellow citizens as nothing other than a cost to be cut at every opportunity. The only thing those opposite like more than spending public money to try to shore up their own jobs is cutting government supports to the vulnerable, whether it is the pension, the NDIS or payments to carers. They tried it on in their first budget, and they haven't stopped since. Tony Abbott tried to cut indexation for carers, something expressly and deliberately designed to leave people on carers' payment almost $80 a week worse off by now. Those on this side of the chamber opposed those cuts. It was only through strong efforts across the country that those opposite were shamed into abandoning their efforts to make life harder for carers. In that same budget, they cut away the concessions that helped carers manage the cost of living. In 2015, Scott Morrison, the present Prime Minister, made a deal with the Greens to cut payments by changing the assets test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The attacks on those doing it toughest didn't change when the Liberals changed Prime Minister. Malcolm Turnbull, with Scott Morrison as his cutter in chief, kept up the Liberals' shameful tradition of putting people in need of support last. Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison thought the best thing for the country was to cut thousands of dollars a year from some of Australia's lowest-income families. Scott Morrison's enthusiasm for cuts meant that Malcolm Turnbull promoted him to Treasurer, where he kept up the cutting, trying to slash the energy supplement designed to help carers cope with price rises caused by the government's energy policy chaos. He succeeded on his second try, and excluded carers from the energy assistance payment in the 2017 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes the government is bringing forward with this bill are a worthy but modest change which will iron out an inconsistency in the way that payments are treated when children reach 16. It also provides a sensible and compassionate change to the eligibility for payments to carers caring for someone with a terminal illness between the ages of 16 and 18. Currently carers who engage proactively and early and have their child assessed for eligibility as an adult can find that their payments are ceasing earlier than those who do not engage. This bill means that payments will be made to carers until their children reach the age of 16 and three months so that carers who engage in a timely way are not disadvantaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also makes changes to eligibility for people with a terminal illness who are between the ages and16 and 18. In essence, carers looking after a person who is likely to pass on between the ages of 16 and 18 will not lose access to payments or need to go through an adult assessment process. Carers in this circumstance are enduring one of the most difficult times I can imagine, and I can't imagine one member of this place taking issue with this modest, compassionate measure, which will leave families with one less hurdle to confront.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will make continuing to access vital support easier for those receiving the carer payment, and Labor will support them, and I indicated that earlier on in my speech, as well as moving the second reading amendment. These changes will not make up for almost a decade of attacks on carers and the support they depend on. Labor will never forget the government's history of shameful treatment of those they should have been proud to support.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Improved Child to Adult Transfer for Care Payment and Carer Allowance) Bill 2022 and to support the amendment moved by my friend and colleague the member for Barton. Labor supports this bill, which will address an anomaly in the process of reassessing the eligibility of carers to receive the carer payment and carer allowance against the adult criteria for those payments when the child they are caring for turns 16. It would also allow carers of a person aged between 16 and 18 who has a terminal illness to continue to receive the carer payment without having to go through the process of being reassessed against the adult criteria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will extend eligibility for carer payment and carer allowance in relation to a child until the later of the child turning 16 and three months or Services Australia completing an assessment of continued eligibility for carer payments under the adult rules if the required information is provided before the child turns 16. It would extend eligibility for carer allowance, healthcare card only, until the child is 16 and three months, in line with the above. And it will extend eligibility for carer payment for carers of a person over 16 who has a terminal illness until the later of the child turning 18 or Services Australia completing an assessment of continued eligibility for carer payments under the adult rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main forms of financial support provided to carers are carer payment, which mirrors the age pension, currently $987.60 per fortnight for a single person, and the carer allowance, currently $136.50 per fortnight. Eligibility for carer payment and carer allowance are assessed differently depending on whether the person being cared for is aged under 16 or 16 and over. The Adult Disability Assessment Tool is used for those aged 16 and over, and the Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) is used for those under 16. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The change in assessment criteria at 16 is in line with eligibility for the disability support pension, which commences at 16. In general, it is more difficult for carers to qualify for payments if they are taking care of an adult. As a result, a proportion of carers lose access to payments when the child they are caring for turns 16. Before a child turns 16, carers can be reassessed to see whether they meet the payment threshold that applies to adults. This process can start some time, as you would expect, before the child turns 16.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the assessment is conducted before a child turns 16 and the assessment finds that the carer will not be eligible for ongoing payments, payments cease when the child turns 16. However, if a carer does not engage in the process, payments continue until the child is 16 and three months before being automatically cancelled. Historically, this process was probably put in place to support carers who had not been able to complete the relevant assessment before the child they were taking care of turned 16; however, this process disadvantages people who engage earlier in the process. Extending eligibility for carer payment and carer allowance for all carers of children aged up to 16 years and three months will mean carers are not disadvantaged in engaging in the adult assessment process early. All carers will continue to receive payments until the child they are caring for turns 16 and three months, regardless of continued eligibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also indicated it will improve communication with carers of children who are about to turn 16. This includes bringing forward letters about changes in eligibility criteria by three months so that carers will receive them when the child turns 15 and six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the eligibility rules for the carer payment for a person with a terminal illness between the ages of 16 and 18 will mean that some carers will lose access to payments or will need to go through the adult assessment process. This change may be of help to some carers who are taking care of a person who is likely to pass away between the ages of 16 and 18. If the person being cared for survives to 18 then they will need to meet the adult criteria for the carers to continue receiving payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While welcome, I would like to take this opportunity on the day after the budget to reflect on the incredible contribution made by Australia's 2.65 million unpaid carers. These are people who each and every day care for a loved one, a partner, a child, a friend. They do it because they care and they do it with an enormous toll on themselves. Research conducted for Carers Australia in 2020 found these unpaid carers provided nearly 2.2 billion hours of care. The cost of replacing that care was estimated in 2020 to be around $78 billion and that will have only grown through COVID, while so many carers have been isolated, alone, with the withdrawal of formal support services through the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 862,000 carers are the primary carer of the person they care for. Seven out of 10 primary carers are women. One in three provide care for 40 hours a week or more, and over 25 per cent—a quarter—provide care for more than 60 hours per week. That is all day, every day. As we enter the third year of a pandemic, carers are burnt out, they are exhausted and they desperately need more support. These responsibilities also have an impact on the carer—their own health and wellbeing. Carers Australia has asked for them to be considered as a vulnerable group in their own right. Their responsibilities limit carers' opportunities to participate in education and training, community activities or paid employment. It is estimated that, collectively, carers forgo income of some $15.2 billion a year. That is, across Australia, the collective contribution of what carers are forgoing—$15.2 billion a year—in order to care for their loved one. Whether it was like me helping to care for my dad or people helping to care for their partner or children, being a carer is a tough job. As my mum says, 'They do it because they love them.' She said she did not sign up to be a carer; it was not a club she wanted to join.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a profound and enduring impact on carers. The national carers survey undertaken in the first years of the pandemic reported the impact of COVID-19 on carers. These are just some of the impacts: nearly half of the carers who responded were experiencing high or very high psychological distress and one in three felt highly socially isolated. They felt alone and vulnerable while they were trying to support the most vulnerable person in their life. One in three respondents to the survey said they never get time out from their caring responsibilities—never—with only half having enough time to keep on top of the other responsibilities of trying to hold down a job, of trying to keep a roof over their head and, with the cost-of-living pressures rising, of trying to keep food on the table. One in four carers reported spending more money than they made in the last 12 months. Every 12 months, they're going backwards, and this impact is long term, across their life span. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact has been particularly felt by parent carers of children with a disability and partner/family carers of older Australians waiting for home care, waiting for care at home or waiting for residential aged care. And, as the chance for respite dwindled and visitors to the house or home were limited or just not allowed, carers were even more isolated, alone and vulnerable. And yet the government has done very little to support carers through this difficult time, which will continue, as we're in the third year of this pandemic. The vaccine rollout, particularly the failure to prioritise vaccination of people with disabilities, their carers and age and disability support workers, left carers isolated, anxious for their loved ones and concerned for their own health and wellbeing. Cuts to services resulting from workforce shortages and the additional costs to carers in PPE and RATs have made their lives even harder. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard from a grandparent whose granddaughter is in palliative care. They did not know at the time how much longer she had to live, and they couldn't get a RAT. His granddaughter's parents were just desperate, and they were phoning around, scrambling to get a RAT so that they could comply—which of course they wanted to do—with the requirements of the palliative care centre where she was being looked after. Just stop and pause for a moment and think about your loved one being in palliative care and you not being able to get a RAT so that you can comply with a requirement to keep them safe and others safe, including those caring for them. It's wrong. So many people have found themselves in that situation, or one not unlike it, through this pandemic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, on the eve of an election, we get from this government, after almost a decade in power, a one-off $250 payment that is meant to take the pressure off carers. What will that do? Most carers I speak to can't afford to own a home; they're renting. Vacancy rates in my community are less than one per cent. You could be trying to rent a home with bedrooms so that you've got a place for the carer and a place for yourself, but it would cost you $600 or $700 a week. What's $250 going to do for someone who's looking at caring for someone for the rest of their life? It won't relieve the pressure. It will just leave them feeling more desperate and alone—and overlooked. That's what most carers tell me. They say they're forgotten, they're invisible, they don't exist. People remark that they know that what they do is valuable, that it's a contribution, but where's the meaningful action? Where's the proper financial support for carers? Where's the recognition that, in caring for their loved one, they're doing something on behalf of all of us? Where is the proper support for them to get back into paid work, to be able to fully participate, to have super when they retire? Being a carer is stressful, it's demanding, and people do it because they love the person. It is particularly demanding for carers of children with a disability, and this government has done nothing to ease this stress or pressure, and, at times, it has made it worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to a mum recently, in Blue Haven, with twin daughters who are seven, and she has just been notified that their NDIS package was being cut. Her daughters live with ADHD and autism, and she's been struggling, having them learning from home for much of the last two years and going into a third year. She's just desperate. She's a capable person who has been left in this situation. What does she do? Does she seek a disability advocate, wait months and try to battle this in the tribunal, against the government's expensive lawyers? Or will they fall out of the system altogether, which is what has happened to so many of the most vulnerable people and families in our community? How can someone deal with Centrelink, NDIS or My Aged Care and all of this at the same time? One NDIS participant told me that being an NDIS participant was a full-time job, it's so demanding of them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's 2.65 million unpaid carers are tired, worn out, exhausted. They are being forgotten by this government. They are overlooked. They're invisible. They tell me that they don't count, that sometimes they're an afterthought. The government scrambles, 'Oh, what have we done for carers? Maybe we should give them $250.' They missed out on that support during the pandemic. It's just wrong. In a wealthy country like Australia, where the government's spruiking that we're having the best economic recovery from the pandemic and leading the world—we're a trillion dollars in debt—and yet carers can't get the proper support they need. Do you know what they need? They need heart. They need a government that cares. They need someone with empathy to walk side by side with them, not a government that puts hurdles and barriers and obstacles every step of the way that they have to fight and struggle to get the basic things that any of us want—a roof over our heads, the opportunity to have a good job, to contribute, to be able to care for the ones that we love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm here today because of my dad and my mum and their experience. Their experience reflects the experience of millions of people and families around the country. All it takes is an accident, an injury, for someone to end up needing care overnight, like my sister's friend Steve, who, in his early 30s, ended up with a spinal cord injury. He has struggled to get the basic support that he needs to live with dignity, to lead a meaningful and contributing life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's carers deserve better. They shouldn't be overlooked, forgotten, invisible. They do matter. Every single one of them counts. I say to them: if we are fortunate to form a government after the election, Australian carers will be better off. They must be.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>): I rise in support of the Social Security Amendment (Improved Child to Adult Transfer for Carer Payment and Carer Allowance) Bill 2022. I want to take this opportunity to speak to the impact of the proposed changes to the child-to-adult transfer process for many families in my electorate of Mayo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mount Barker in my electorate is one of the fastest-growing centres in South Australia, attracting a growing number of families, some of whom are caring for children and young with disability. I've heard from some of these families about anomalies in the rules under the Social Security Act 1991. At present, parents and carers of children receiving a carers payment or allowance who apply for transfer to the adult payment through the adult disability assessment tool, who apply on time but do not qualify, may lose payment when the person receiving care turns 16 or soon after. However, others who do not apply for the assessment on time continue to be paid until the person reaches 16 years and three months. Additionally, carers qualified for a healthcare card who do apply on time may lose access to their cards as soon as the person receiving care turns 16 years old rather than three months later if they no longer qualify.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, all carer payment and carer allowance recipients will remain qualified for payments under child related qualification provisions and for the healthcare card until the person turns 16 years and three months. The government's stated aim is to remove any incentive to delay engagement with the application process and to provide for a more equitable process. Importantly, carers will also be notified earlier, 15 years and six months rather than 15 years and nine months, to provide more lead-in time to apply for the transfer to the adult carer payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also advises that Services Australia will better support implementation by streamlining the process and communicating more clearly so that carers understand what is needed of them. I am particularly interested in this part. Last year, I heard from a constituent, a single mum, whose husband had sadly passed away, leaving her with two young children, one of whom had significant intellectual disabilities and health issues. My constituent stated to me that she completed and returned the adult disability assessment tool in the month of her child's 16th birthday when she received the necessary paperwork from Centrelink. Her child carers payment was cancelled three months later, and she then received a request from Centrelink for additional information, which she supplied. However, both her child carers payment and healthcare card were cancelled. This mum of two said that she tried to make contact more than 20 times and was put on hold for several hours each time, waiting to speak to someone to get help. She said she was left at her wits end by the whole process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Her focus needed to be on caring for her family, not on 20 phone calls to Centrelink.

They're not trying to get away with anything. They're just receiving, if they receive a Centrelink payment, the absolute basics that actually don't even cover the necessities anymore. I urge the government to make it easier for families with children with disabilities, children who are transitioning to becoming adults, and let's make it a service system; it's called Services Australia, so let's make it a service system and not a system that undermines and grinds people down and makes them give up.</span>

This bill helps to ensure a smoother transition for carers moving from the child stream to the adult stream of the carer payment or care allowance. From 1 April 2023, the measure will ensure all carers retain equal access to carer payment and care allowance until their care receiver turns 16 years and three months. At this time they can transfer to the adult stream of payment if they are assessed as eligible. The measure also ensures carers who submit their documentation for the adult stream before their care receiver turns 16 years but have not been assessed by the time to care receiver turns 16 years and three months will remain eligible for payment until the claim is assessed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The standalone carer allowance healthcare card currently cancels when the care receiver turns 16 years of age. Under this measure, qualification for the standalone HCC would align with the carer allowance, meaning all standalone carer allowance healthcare cards will continue until the carer receiver turns 16 years and three months of age. The Australian government is committed to achieving fair and equitable access to payments and supporting carers, allocating around $9 billion per year to over 620,000 carers. This bill builds on the Australian government's commitment. We have listened to carers and acted to make this process simpler and easier for them and their families.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  The National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 1) Bill 2021 implements the government's response to a small number of recommendations of the review of the legal framework of the national intelligence community, which was led by Dennis Richardson AC, an eminent Australian; a review which was delivered to the government in December 2020. The bill also, implicitly at least, rejects one of Mr Richardson's recommendations. The bill also includes amendments recommended by the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review, which was conducted by Michael L'Estrange and Stephen Merchant, and other measures intended to address important and pressing issues facing those agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important purpose of the bill is to address or mitigate critical operational challenges facing key agencies that comprise the national intelligence community, being the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Intelligence. Regardless of who forms government following the next election, it is safe to say that this parliament will see further legislation implementing other recommendations of the comprehensive review conducted by Mr Richardson in coming months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes the following 14 schedules. Schedule 1 empowers the head of ASIS, ASD or AGO to authorise the production of intelligence on an Australian person who is overseas, without the approval of the responsible minister in an emergency situation. To give an emergency authorisation, the agency head must be satisfied that there is or is likely to be an imminent risk to the safety of an Australian person, that it is not reasonably practicable to obtain the person's consent and that it is reasonable to believe that the person would consent if they were able to do so—for example, where an Australian has been kidnapped. The responsible minister must be notified of the authorisation as soon as practicable, and, in any event, within eight hours, and the minister may cancel it at any time. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who of course has the oversight role for the intelligence community, must also be notified of the authorisation as soon as practicable. There are also a range of other safeguards in place, including record-keeping requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 enables ASIS, ASD and AGO to seek ministerial authorisation to produce intelligence on a class of Australian persons who are or are likely to be involved with a listed terrorist organisation, noting that under existing law an agency must obtain an individual ministerial authorisation for each separate Australian on whom it seeks to produce intelligence. Schedule 2 would impose additional requirements for class authorisations, including in relation to the information that an agency head must provide to the responsible minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 enables ASD and AGO to seek ministerial authorisation to undertake activities to produce intelligence on an Australian person or class of Australian persons to assist the Australian Defence Force in support of military operations. Currently, when ASD and AGO are supporting Australian Defence Force operations, they must seek a ministerial authorisation for each individual Australian person who is determined to be part of, for example, a foreign militia group that is conducting operations against the ADF. Dennis Richardson argued that this requirement can delay ASD's and AGO's ability to respond rapidly and identify new threats to the ADF and its operations. The amendments in schedule 3 respond to that concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 would provide a definition of 'prescribed activity' and an explanation of what is meant by 'producing intelligence' to clarify that the range of activities for which ASIS, ASD and AGO require ministerial authorisation include the use of covert and intrusive intelligence collection methods, including those methods for which ASIO would require a warrant if conducted onshore, and expressly or impliedly requesting a foreign partner agency to produce intelligence on an Australian person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The upshot of these amendments would be to limit the meaning of the expression 'producing intelligence on an Australian person' so that ministerial authorisations are required for a more limited range of intelligence activities than is currently the case. This is consistent with recommendation 41 of the Richardson review, which found that agencies are having to seek ministerial authorisation in a broad range of circumstances, including circumstances where intelligence activities do not materially interfere with the privacy or other interests of persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 would amend the Intelligence Services Act to enable ASIS, without ministerial authorisation, to conduct activities to produce intelligence on an Australian inside Australia if ASIO requests that assistance for the purposes of assisting ASIO to carry out its functions. Currently, ASIS can only provide ASIO with assistance of this nature outside Australia. The amendments do not allow ASIS to conduct activities in Australia that would otherwise be unlawful. It is very important to highlight that the Richardson review did not support this change, with Dennis Richardson arguing that there was not enough evidence to demonstrate the operational need for ASIS to play a supporting role to ASIO onshore in the same way that it provided that support offshore. However, it is also important to note that such a change was supported by the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review. Ultimately, the intelligence and security committee agreed with the conclusion and recommendations of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review on this matter.</span>

We held one public hearing and received a number of confidential briefings from agencies. Ultimately, Labor and Liberal members agreed that the bill should be passed by the parliament, subject to an amendment being made to the explanatory memorandum to clarify that a ministerial authorisation enabling ASIS, ASD and AGO to produce intelligence on a class of Australian persons who are or are likely to be involved with a listed terrorist organisation will not authorise the production of intelligence on a lawyer advocating for the de-listing of a terrorist organisation. The report of the committee further explains that amendment to the explanatory memorandum that the committee has called for. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

These reforms will strengthen the ability of our intelligence agencies to respond to emerging threats and the increasingly sophisticated capabilities of our adversaries. The bill has been reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I am pleased to say that the PJCIS has recommended that the bill be passed without any amendments, reflecting the bipartisan consensus on the importance of these reforms. I thank the PJCIS for its considered review.</span>

The measures in the bill are designed to address or mitigate critical operational challenges faced by the national intelligence community. The bill reflects the government's commitment to the continual improvement of Australia's robust national security laws to ensure that Australians are kept safe and secure in our society.

This important Treasury bill was introduced this morning. It appears that although the intention always was that it be adjourned for debate later this day the Speaker put the question that the resumption of debate be made an order of the day for the next sitting rather than later this day. That motion was put by the Speaker and was carried by the House. No objection to that motion was raised by the Assistant Treasurer, who was at the table, and apparently had carriage of these important bills which are, obviously, crucial to pass today, and I think everyone in the House understands why. The live minutes recorded that the bill had been adjourned for debate later today but it was quite clear that the recording of proceedings in the House showed that, actually, the Assistant Treasurer had allowed or acquiesced in the debate being adjourned for the next sitting, which would obviously be an incredibly difficult position for the government and for the Australian people more broadly. We want these bills to be dealt with today. The shadow Treasurer has made that clear. But I think it was important that the House has clarity as to why we are having to deal with a suspension of standing orders that has been moved by the minister at the table.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  The budget last night delivered from that dispatch box less than 24 hours ago had three defining features. First of all, there is $1 trillion in debt with nowhere near enough to show for that incredibly significant addition of debt that has been put on the budget by those opposite, so $1 trillion in debt and not enough to show for it. Secondly, real wages are falling in the budget. The average worker is $26 a week, $1,355 a year, worse off as a consequence of the real wage cuts which were outlined there in black and white in the government's budget last night. The third defining feature was buried there on a page 49 of Budget Paper No. 2: $3 billion in secret cuts that the government does not want to come clean on this side of the election. If there is a theme that emerges from this budget, it is that the government has taken a whole bunch of problems and challenges that exist in the economy and in our communities from one side of the election and put them on the other side of the election. That is true of the cost-of-living relief that we will be talking about in this bill but it is also true about a whole range of other measures. They've got a cash splash before the election, and then they've got at least $3 billion in secret cuts after the election. They won't tell us if that's pensions, Medicare or some other type of cut that they've attempted before, frankly, over the almost decade that they've been in office. They've tried to come after people's living standards. They've tried to come after Medicare. They've tried to come after pensions. They've got $3 billion of secret cuts in the budget that they won't come clean on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance have been asked repeatedly today to come clean. What does this $3 billion in cuts on page 49 of Budget Paper No. 2 mean for average Australians? What cuts will you make if you are re-elected in May? Neither the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance nor the Prime Minister has been willing or able to come clean on what those $3 billion in secret cuts are. As all of the nauseating spin and marketing has died down, and all the self-congratulation and backslapping that happened on budget night over on that side has died down, the question that remains is: what are the $3 billion in cuts? Why won't they come clean this side of the election? They owe it to the Australian people to tell them today, and certainly before the election, what those $3 billion in cuts are going to be. Is it pensions? Is it Medicare? Is it something else? And is that why they don't want to come clean to the Australian people about what it is?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three defining features of the budget: not enough to show for $1 trillion in debt; real wages going backwards because the cost of living is skyrocketing, real wages are falling and ordinary working families are falling further and further behind; and then those secret cuts. It's a budget that takes a lot of challenges for people and moves them from this side of the election to the other side of the election. It's almost as if the Prime Minister woke up at some point in the last couple of weeks, rang the Treasurer and said: 'I've got to call an election in the next fortnight or so. Let's get the shovel out, and hopefully we can shovel enough money around in people's direction that they will forget that we have spent the best past of a decade going after the wages, job security, pensions and Medicare of ordinary Australians who live week to week, fortnight to fortnight on their pay cheques.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has gone after them for the best part of a decade, and they're hoping if they shovel enough money around on the eve of an election that all of a sudden Australians will forget the damage that those opposite have done to their living standards with this almost decade-long campaign of undermining their job security, undermining their wages growth, undermining the pension system and undermining Medicare. All of those things have been like a hammer blow to the living standards of ordinary working Australians. In this cynical, political budget, they think that, if they shovel enough money in the direction of Australians, Australians will forget the damage that the government have done to household budgets over the course of the best part of the last decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the truth is, I think people know this. I think people are seeing through this budget just like they're seeing through this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. Out there in the suburbs, towns, cities and communities of this great country, they understand that nothing that was announced last night in the budget will make up for that decade-long campaign against their wages growth and their job security. They understand that, even after the relief which was budgeted for last night and which we're looking to pass through the parliament today, people are still way, way, way behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the average cost-of-living increases over the past year or so, they are something like $3,600. People are in the hole because costs of living have been skyrocketing. That's before you even think about the extra pressure put on the economy and on prices by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Prices didn't start skyrocketing and pressure didn't start being applied to working families when Russia invaded Ukraine; it started when the coalition started attacking wages and living standards. People understand that, no matter how much cost-of-living relief is in the budget and passes through the House today, they are still in the hole $3,600 on average in terms of cost-of-living increases and in terms of that real wages cut this year of $1,355 per year on average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing that we are talking about today makes up for the damage that those opposite have done to household budgets, not accidentally but deliberately. They said that stagnant wages were a deliberate design feature of their economic policy. In lots of ways, this is mission accomplished, because we've got yet another year of real wages going backwards in the government's own budget. What we have said consistently and what we've said for some time is that we won't be standing in the way of some cost-of-living relief, which is made necessary by the government's attacks on wages and the fact that real wages are going backwards. We intend to support the bills which are before the House today which cover the measures announced last night to provide some cost-of-living relief for Australians, particularly pensioners and workers on low and middle incomes, and also motorists, with the fuel excise cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth mentioning though, and consistent with what I was talking about before, about taking problems from one side of the election to the other, that what the government will be legislating today is an increase in petrol prices in September, and they'll be legislating the end of the low- and middle-income tax offset. So, if you think about it, if the government were to change hands in May, whether the election is on 14 or 21 or 7 May, the inheritance for a new government—or the inheritance, frankly, for a re-elected government—would be a trillion dollars of debt with nothing to show for it; interest rates going up, as the Reserve Bank has flagged and others have flagged; petrol prices going up in September; and the end of the low- and middle-income tax offset. This is the inheritance after a decade in office that these characters have delivered to the Australian people. After all of the sacrifices that Australians have made for each other, the thanks they get is a trillion dollars in debt, falling real wages, some temporary relief on the eve of an election, but no long-term plan for the future of this economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was missing in this budget that has a shelf life of about six or seven weeks—this act of political desperation that was handed down by the Treasurer over there last night—is a genuine plan for the future. After what Australians have been through together, the least they can expect is that their government can tell them what's next in the economy. How do we generate the opportunities and make it easier for people to grab those opportunities in the economy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From our point of view, how do we deal with the skills crisis in this economy by providing fee-free TAFE? How do we get our energy costs down with cheaper and cleaner energy? How do we deal with child care so that, if people want to work more and earn more, they've got the capacity to do it? How do we modernise the NBN so that we can have a digital economy where people aren't just deciding how they work but where they work from, including in some of our terrific regional cities and towns? How do we co-invest in advanced manufacturing and in other ways to make sure that we are creating new, secure jobs and new, secure industries of the future? That's what a plan for the future economy would look like. It was absent from the budget last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government doesn't want to come up with a plan that extends beyond the May election then we're happy to fill that void left by the lack of leadership from those opposite. But first we intend to pass this cost-of-living relief through the parliament. We'd like to see that happen today. It's our understanding that it can happen today. That would provide some relief for Australians, but nowhere near the kind of relief which would make up for the attacks that those opposite have waged on ordinary working people in this country for the best part of a decade.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Outside the gates of parliament right now there are several hundred aged-care workers who've come to Canberra. Many of them got up at about five o'clock this morning and travelled from the Illawarra, my electorate, on buses up Macquarie Pass and up the rickety Picton Road, and it was their expectation that today they'd be celebrating a budget that looked to the future of aged care and provided some relief for the crisis in aged care. It was their expectation that the budget would provide relief for the crisis in aged care. No such relief was provided. These are workers who are working 10-, 12-, 14-hour days and double shifts because the rosters can't be filled, because staff are leaving, because staff are falling sick, because the lack of decent pay in the sector means the employers can't attract new workers to the sector. They are doing backbreaking work and sometimes dangerous work. They're doing it because they love our elder Australians, but they are not being rewarded and recognised for the hard, essential work that they do day in, day out. They may be locked out of Scott Morrison's budget, but they're not locked out of Labor's plans for the future of aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It tells you everything you need to know about this Prime Minister. He has delivered a budget which is all about the next six weeks and not the future of the country. Whether it's the crisis running through our aged-care system, whether it's the climate crisis and the resulting floods up and down the east coast of Australia—two floods in a month; the desperation of those people in northern New South Wales and South-East Queensland is unbelievable—there is no part for these people in the budget that the Prime Minister delivered last night. Instead we got a budget which was designed all about a short-term political fix instead of the long-term challenges for the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were told yesterday morning that this budget was going to herald a new era for wage rises for the workers of Australia. But, like everything this government does, when you look at the detail, you see that they say one thing but they do another. Baked into this government's economic plan for Australia is a real wage cut. This year alone, wages are going to go back by 2.5 per cent. At the end of this financial year, workers are going to be 2.5 per cent worse off than they were at the beginning of the year. This is not an accident. This is their plan. And they never catch up—not next year, not the year after, not the year after that. Under the economic plan that Scott Morrison is presenting to the people of Australia, workers cop a 2.5 per cent wage cut and they never catch up. They will be worse off by over $1,350 a year, and they never catch up. Like everything this Prime Minister does, he tries to distract them with a few things over here while the real damage is going on over there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll allow these bills to pass through the parliament posthaste, because we want motorists to get some relief from the soaring price of petrol increases and we want workers to have a few extra dollars in their pockets to ensure that they can pay the increase in grocery bills. But let's not kid ourselves that these are dealing with the underlying problems. The workers of Australia need a pay rise, and Scott Morrison has promised that under his government they will never get one—not in year 1, not in year 2, not in year 3. Under his budget, they go back by 2.5 per cent and they never recover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just wages that is the problem under this government. We know the issues of cost of living—yes, it's petrol prices; yes, it's grocery prices—but the things that working families are struggling with are the big, lumpy bills that hit them once a month or once a quarter. They live in panic that they're not going to have enough cash on hand to meet the costs, whether it's their childcare bills, whether it's their insurance bills, whether it's the very real threat that interest rates are going to go up and up and up when they are mortgaged to the hilt and they can't afford to pay for it, or whether it's the threat that the $3 billion worth of secret cuts is going to hit them in health care, is going to hit them in education, or is going to hit them in family benefits or some other area which this Prime Minister won't fess up to until after the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In complete contrast to this guy over here, Labor has a plan to deal with those big, lumpy cost-of-living issues. Under our plan for child care, the overwhelming majority of Australians won't have to panic about that childcare bill, and they will be able to make a decision between the mother and the father, between the parents of that child, about whether one stays home from work, or they both stay home from work, or they share the burden or they both return to work, knowing that the cost of child care is not going to be the deciding factor. That's how you deal with cost-of-living issues, and that's how you increase participation rates in our workforce, dealing with the skills crisis by ensuring that more men and women who are having families can return to work as and when they want to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard a lot of talk about housing. I've got to say we see some merit in providing additional support for first home buyers to cover the cost of their mortgage insurance. Indeed, we were pleased that the government copied the policy that was announced by the member for Blaxland and the Leader of the Opposition on Friday of last week in my electorate. We are pleased that the government has copied this, because it's good policy and it means that people in regional Australia who are seeking access to the housing market will be able to have that peace of mind. But when rents in my electorate have gone up by as much as 50 per cent over the last 12 months, and that's if you can get a house—to hear the Prime Minister say, as he did this morning on national television, 'Don't worry; if you can't afford the rent, just buy the house.' This is the reality that this guy lives in. Rents are going up and up, there are people living in cars or sleeping on couches, there's overcrowded housing, and the Prime Minister's solution for people who cannot afford to pay their rent is to say, 'Don't worry about it; just go and buy the house that you're living in.' What planet is this guy living on? It just goes to show that this man is so out of touch, so absolutely out of touch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understand that the answer to the housing crisis is multifaceted. Yes, helping first home buyers into the market by covering the cost of mortgage insurance is part of the solution, but, unless you're dealing with the supply side, you're just going to see prices go up and up. You do not need a crystal ball to work out whether this is going to happen; just look at the last three years. There's been a 20 per cent increase in house prices in capital cities over the last 12 months, and a whopping 26 per cent in regional Australia. In fact, the policy that the government announced in the budget yesterday probably won't work in a lot of regional places around the country, because you'll struggle to find a house for under $800,000. That's why, under Labor's plan, one of the first things we would do is review those caps. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact of the matter is that this government doesn't have a comprehensive plan for housing, for aged care, for wages or for skills. It's all short-termism: 'What can we announce that people will forget about the next week, in our rush to the election?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about the secret cuts that are embedded in this budget. I want to see the minister, in his summing up, come to the dispatch box and come clean to the people of Australia. What is it that you are going to cut? It is extraordinary that, in a budget on the eve of an election, they've secreted into the budget a $3 billion whack to services. I want to put that $3 billion into context. It's about a quarter of what we spend on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It's a little less than 10 per cent of what we spend on Medicare. So this is not a small amount of money. Is it a 10 per cent cut to Medicare? Is it a 25 per cent cut to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Is it a cut to family payments? Are the government going to delay some of the other things that they've promised Australian families? The government must come clean. Where is the $3 billion slash and burn to services or benefits that the government has budgeted on but won't come clean about to Australian families? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say a few things about some initiatives in my local area. The member for Cunningham and I have worked hard over the last five years, campaigning for upgrades to Picton Road. It's absolutely critical in my electorate. People travelling from the Southern Highlands down to Wollongong, as many do to go to university or to go to work, will tell you that this is a death strip. We're very pleased that the hard campaigning on the Picton Road has seen over $90 million allocated to improvements to the interchange. It's a good start. More will need to be done. There are still too many black spots on that road, there are still too many places where separation and hard barriers are needed, and some of the absolutely deadly spots on that road need to be fixed, but we welcome the $90 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to say something about domestic violence and domestic violence services. For the last five years the women at the Illawarra Women's Health Centre, led by the force of nature Sally Stevenson, have done an absolutely outstanding job in putting together a proposal, getting it researched and getting it market tested on how we meet the big gap in trauma recovery services for domestic violence. The one thing we know is that we have almost met some of the needs in emergency services. More needs to be done to provide counselling and more needs to be done to provide emergency housing services, but the one area that we are not even touching the sides on is long-term trauma recovery for women and children who are victims of family and domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am so excited about the fact that the budget has allocated $25 million to the Women's Trauma Recovery Centre, with the proponent being the Illawarra Women's Health Centre—but they've formed an alliance with other women's services, the University of Wollongong, the University of New South Wales. I expect it will get support from local councils and local businesses as well. It's a first-rate proposal. It will probably serve as a model for other services around the country. So I'm delighted, and I congratulate Minister Ruston for allocating the funds. To the members of the Prime Minister's staff who took our meeting when I brought a delegation to Canberra: thank you for taking this issue seriously. Frankly, the issue of domestic violence should be above political partisanship. I genuinely thank all of those who have been involved in advocating for this and bringing a proposal forward, and I'm delighted that it has been funded in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is supposed to be a plan for the future of the country; it is not. It's a plan to let the Prime Minister race to the next election in the hope that the people of Australia will forget about the neglect of the last eight years and reward this Prime Minister with a second decade in government. The people of Australia deserve much better than that. They deserve a government which is as good as they are, a government with a vision for the future for the country and the interests of ordinary Australians in mind, not these nakedly political stunts which we saw revealed when the Treasurer stood at that dispatch box yesterday evening. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  This budget has all of the credibility of those 'back in black' mugs that had to be smashed by the dozen after the Treasurer broke his pledge to have the budget back in surplus. This is of course the coalition that came to office in 2013 pledging to have the budget back in surplus in its first year and in every year after that. It is now, in this latest budget, forecasting deficits as far as the eye can see, with gross debt set to top $1 trillion, a figure which is so large that it's probably more helpful to say that, in per person terms, that's around $40,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it isn't just the scale of the debt that concerns Labor; it's the low quality of the spend. This is the government which gave $20 billion of JobKeeper to firms with rising revenues, some of which went to offshore billionaires in France, Italy and South Africa. It's the government which had the slowest vaccine rollout in the world this time last year, and which is now belatedly suggesting that it will have mRNA vaccine manufacturing up and going next year, in the third or fourth year of the pandemic. It's a government which presided over an aged-care crisis whose situation was described aptly by the interim report of the royal commission with one word: neglect. It's a government which has seen real wages grow at just 1.4 per cent in its entire time in office and which in this very budget sees real wages fall by 1.5 per cent, equivalent to some $1,355 for the typical worker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen the real cost-of-living pressure that many of my constituents are under. I've heard the stories of their street stalls. I visited Foodbank Western Australia with Zaneta Mascarenhas, Labor's candidate for Swan, to talk about the pressures that Perth residents are under. I visited St Merkorious with Sally Sitou to hear about the pressures facing families in Strathfield. I spent time speaking to the team at Vinnies North Sydney with Labor's North Sydney candidate, Catherine Renshaw, discussing the very real cost-of-living pressures that are being faced by those families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that would be anathema to just about every former Liberal treasurer, not to mention the Labor ones. I'm old enough to remember Joe Hockey's 2014 budget speech. That was the budget in which the coalition increased fuel prices through reinstating the indexation of the fuel excise. It was the 2014 budget which said, 'The age of entitlement is over,' and which changed the indexation rate for pensions so it moved from wages to prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, of course, we had the Prime Minister, who in 2017 gave a speech in which he said that, if he'd knocked on your door and warned that Kevin Rudd 'would turn a $20 billion surplus into a $27 billion deficit in just one year', he would have been accused of scaremongering. He went on to talk about some of the ways in which the Rudd and Gillard governments combatted the global financial crisis and then said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If I said any of this you would've called the police. You would have said there's a madman on my doorstep.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, as we all know, all of this happened and more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Labor's truth in Government is stranger than any fiction I can imagine, but the economic damage under Labor is always very real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's from a prime minister that has now presided over the largest debt in Australian history. It's from a prime minister who, before the COVID pandemic hit, had doubled the debt and then has gone on to send it to unprecedented levels. The fact is that the Liberal Party has no credibility on economic management. Its credibility on economic management has been shredded, as has the Prime Minister's own credibility. We've heard Liberal Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells last night describing the Prime Minister as 'an autocrat and a bully who has no moral compass'. This is from the woman who helped save his preselection in Cook when he got just eight out of 150 votes in the first round. This is following revelations just last month that the Deputy Prime Minister had described the Prime Minister as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a hypocrite and a liar from my observations and that is over a long time. I have never trusted him and I dislike how he earnestly rearranges the truth to a lie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the Deputy Prime Minister describing the Prime Minister of Australia. It's no wonder Australians don't trust this Prime Minister. It's no wonder Australians see this budget as a ploy for an election, not a plan for the future.</span>

                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">L</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">eader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I rise to make a few brief remarks about these bills, which have in their title 'cost-of-living support' but do not go to the fundamental issues that would make people's lives easier. People are feeling very real cost-of-living pressures after almost a decade of this government. But those hits are coming from low wages, high costs for health care and a housing crisis. As we find ourselves in a climate crisis, a housing crisis and an affordability crisis, this budget was the opportunity to fix it. Instead, what we've got is a budget that will make these crises worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget makes housing more expensive, it locks in tax cuts for the super wealthy and it funds more coal and gas. There's about $37 billion—and rising—for coal and gas corporations. But climate change gets its funding cut by about a third, and there's only $1 billion and a bit for renewable energy. There's $13 billion to push up the price of housing, and zero dollars for new, affordable housing. Meanwhile, there's a $420 one-off payment for low-to-middle-income earners, but billionaires get $9,000 a year every year, forever. If you're a low-income earner, you get $420, once. If you're a billionaire, you get $9,000 per year forever. This budget will make the climate crisis, the inequality crisis and the housing crisis worse, and that's why, fortunately, this is going to be the government's last budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to tackle cost-of-living pressures, as this bill suggests, there are a number of things that we could do. We could not proceed with the unfair stage 3 tax cuts, which Liberal and Labor back, that see $184 billion ripped out of the budget and funnelled to those at the top—where the top 10 per cent get the overwhelming share of that $184 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What could we do instead? If we really want to tackle cost-of-living pressures, we should wipe student debt instead of giving tax cuts to billionaires. Wiping student debt would make a real difference to the 2.9 million people who've got HECS or HELP debts of an average of $24,000. And we could do that for about a third of the cost of the Liberal-Labor tax cuts for billionaires package that funnels the majority of savings to the 10 per cent. It's $184 billion to give tax cuts to the very wealthy or $60 billion to wipe student debt and make a massive difference to people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we really want to tackle the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing and being hit by, we'd wipe student debt and make housing more affordable. The Greens have got a plan to build a million homes over the next 15 to 20 years that people can buy for $300,000 or rent for 25 per cent of their income. You could do that. You could build a million homes, wipe student debt and still have change left over from the unfair tax cuts package that this budget enshrines through Labor and Liberal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to understand what a grave threat to social democracy we're facing in this country. This budget enshrines a flat tax system, a trickle-down nightmare, where someone on a minimum wage pays the same tax rate as a CEO, and Labor's going to wave it through. This will make Australia more unfair, and it will rip $184 billion out of the budget, money that could be used to wipe student debt, build a million affordable homes and get dental and mental health into Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, if we really want to tackle cost-of-living pressures, we've got to deal with the structural problems that people and this country are facing. If we want to deal with cost-of-living pressures, we need to make people's lives easier not just with a one-off payment but permanently. By getting dental and mental health into Medicare, by building affordable housing and by wiping student debt, you would make people's lives better not just for one budget, not just for one election, but for year after year after year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget tells us one thing, and it's that we need to kick this rotten government out. But the next government is also committed to a flat tax, trickle-down-nightmare system. We've got to fix that. We've got to make sure that the next budget that gets passed after we've said goodbye to this government makes this country a fairer place by getting dental and mental health into Medicare, by wiping student debt and by building affordable homes so that everyone has a secure and affordable roof over their head.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  Much was hoped for last night—for this government to finally address some of the major issues and embrace some of the opportunities we have ahead, but I am sad to say it is an opportunity missed. In fact, we are going to be miles behind the rest of the world on this kind of plan from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, for Warringah, we did see, finally, after years of neglect when it comes to infrastructure spending, $75 million towards the much-needed upgrade of Wakehurst Parkway, which is scheduled to finish by 2025. And there are some important extensions to grant programs, like the popular Stronger Communities Program, that will support local organisations with facility upgrades. However, still there is no process on Beaches Link tunnel, major infrastructure required for the Northern Beaches, and also no meaningful funding for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. We're talking about iconic locations at the entrance of Sydney Harbour that are important historically for all of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that this was a budget for the Nationals. This is not a budget for the nation. We now know what it cost to secure support for the posturing by the government prior to COP26 last year and to commit to net zero. That cost to the Nationals and Barnaby Joyce was in the tune of between $17 billion and $21 billion. This was a sellout of your children's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The discrepancy in spending between porkbarrelling, targeted spending in electorates because they are marginal, because they want to secure that support, compared to where it is actually needed is just outrageous. It's hard to describe how disappointing this budget is. When we look at the situation that so many communities find themselves in at the moment, in particular on the east coast, in Lismore, which is facing a second flood—and only yesterday in question time the Prime Minister again repeated the fallacy that this is a once-in-500-year event: 'Don't you worry. We'll just help you clean up now and you won't face this again. You'll be fine; she'll be right.' In fact, Lismore is facing this disaster again just weeks after the first, and within the last 10 years it has been ravaged by disaster after disaster. This is a government with its head entirely in the sand, in the past, unable to prepare for the future or to protect our children's future and in any way embrace the opportunities of where the world is heading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because it is under pressure with the poll coming in six weeks, we're seeing a measure around the fuel excise to try to help the cost of living, which I acknowledge is incredibly tough. But, if we want to actually address cost of living, we have to address the underlying causes. The government has decided to halve the fuel excise over the next six months. A 22 cents per litre cut is at the cost of over $3 billion to the budget. There is no long-term vision on addressing transport emissions or fuel security. What we're seeing here is that, on top of the $2 billion already handed out to oil refineries in last year's budget and the $7.7 billion in fuel tax credits to the fossil fuel industry this year, the fuel excise is approximately 12 times more than what has been given to a low emissions vehicles under the government's Future Fuels Fund. Over just this next six months, absolutely nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you a comparison, $3 billion could support a $3,000 rebate for one million electric vehicles or could subsidise the cost of four million homes and business charges. What's worst about this measure is that there is no guarantee it will actually be passed on to consumers. Just as what happens when the Reserve Bank lowers interest rates, when more often than not the big banks don't pass on the full cut to consumers and it's only a percentage of that lowering that consumers get, the same is likely to happen here: there are no measures to ensure this cut actually goes to consumers. And it won't do anything to address the long-term exposure to oil prices or the reliance that we have on imported fuel. Ninety per cent of our fuel is imported each year, and that costs consumers $29 billion. There is nothing in this measure to mitigate long-term threats, volatility and global security challenges of imported oil, nothing to reduce emissions. Transport emissions are expected to increase from 90 to 125 million tonnes by 2030, which is eight Hazelwood coal-fired power stations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing in this budget that accelerates the transition to electric vehicles but there is over $3 billion to basically subsidise the fuel industry. ClimateWorks has modelled that, to reach net zero, we need some 76 per cent of new car sales to be electric by 2030. Under this government we are only projected to get to 30 per cent, and the current rate is less than one per cent. It is a joke. The states are pulling their weight. They are trying to move this, but the federal government has its head completely in denial. The irony is this measure will do so little to help families with vehicle running costs in the long-term. By going electric, families can save up to $140 a month of running costs and 10 tonnes of CO2. With home solar and battery, it could be as high as $160 a month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need in Australia are Australian vehicle emission standards. We need to require manufacturers to import vehicles that have low emissions. We need a government-funded network of chargers for highways, households and businesses. We need upfront rebates for the purchase of electric vehicles and to reform the luxury car tax and fringe benefit taxes, and we need the government fleet to be completely electric by 2023. But there was none of that in the budget last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard most commentators talk mostly about cost of living but there is actually nothing in this budget that truly addresses the cost of living. Whether you like it or not, climate change is the biggest threat to cost of living. All economists agree with that. It is the biggest threat to the budget bottom line and to household cost of living but it got—I measured it—55 seconds from Treasurer Frydenberg in his speech last night out of 35 minutes. It is clear from the Treasurer's words that he has hitched his wagon to the Morrison wagon. He is a denier. He is not at all committed to real action on climate change. So it needs to be very clear where people's commitments really are as people go to the polls in six weeks time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when Lismore and Byron Bay's main streets are completely underwater, blowing out the cost of households, I would ask you: Is $250 in your pocket in the next few weeks really going to solve the problem for people who are losing their homes, for communities that are losing their main street? Businesses are gone. Food prices are already increasing. The disruption from these events is huge. The global food index finds that prices were up 20 per cent on last year already. The cost of house insurance is increasing, with many properties becoming uninsurable from natural disasters. Coastal erosion threatens our cities and coastlines—including in my electorate—with up to half a billion dollars in losses. But is there anything to address that in this budget? No. The costs of natural disasters to the budget bottom line are piling up. Let's get real: $6 billion so far for the Northern New South Wales and South East Queensland floods this year; $2.8 billion dollars for the Black Summer bushfires in 2019-20; $1.5 billion for North Queensland floods in 2019. So do you think, in light of that bigger cost, there would be something in the budget that starts building resilience, that starts investing in adapting, that provides some resilience, some measures, some mitigation to keep those communities safe? In the face of the cumulative costs of natural disasters forecast to become $1.2 trillion over the next 40 years, according to Deloitte, we have a government allocate $210 million—you heard me right, there are not any extra zeros on that—to the Australian Climate Service for climate adaptation and is planning to cut over the next four years by some 35 per cent the funding to organisations that are primarily responsible for our transition to lower emissions. It is farcical. It is really hard to describe it in any other terms. At the same time, despite all the warnings, despite communities being devastated, despite having climate refugees, communities are asking the question: Where are we going to go? If our homes are uninsurable, unliveable, who is going to help us relocate? How are we going to rebuild?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of that, you would think that maybe the answer would be, 'Let's mitigate the issue and reduce it.' But no; the answer is, 'Let's keep accelerating this transition; let's accelerate the problem.' The government is going to spend $50 million on an acceleration of gas infrastructure and $300 million on gas expansion in the Northern Territory. That is added to the $6.3 billion sweetener for the Nationals on three dams that have no serious business cost and that are likely to, in fact, flow to coalmining donors and to run off and flood and cause more environmental disasters. So, if you want to talk about who the winners and losers are in budget, there is no doubt that our kids—future generations—are the losers. They will pay for this mountain of debt that has accumulated and this complete failure to invest in our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you some contrast, the $6.3 billion that has been promised for these three dams could cover the cost of 26 weeks of paid parental leave for new parents. It would be a tax rebate of some $3,000, or over 2.1 billion electric vehicles, or you could build the equivalent of 11 Northern Beaches hospitals with 5,400 beds. You could cover a year's worth of cheaper child care. In contrast, there is $6.3 billion for three dams, in the face of devastating loss of biodiversity. We know that there's an extinction crisis when it comes to our natural habitats, fauna and flora. And there is $100 million for extension of the Environmental Restoration Fund. I mean, really: we couldn't have any clearer message from the coalition government that it does not care about the environment, that it does not care about the climate. It does not care about the environment in which our children and our society will live. All it's interested in is the next six weeks and how much more money can be pork-barrelled into the seats and the fossil fuel industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is always, 'What's the alternative?' Let me give you a picture of the alternative. At just half of the $21 billion that clearly has been paid to the Nationals to placate Barnaby Joyce and get him to sign up to net zero—at just half—we could electrify 10 million Australian households. That would save families $5,000 per year by 2030, delivering $40 billion in savings over the next decade. It would also cut emissions by 33 per cent. So, if we're really having a conversation about reducing the cost of living, let's actually invest in measures that will provide long-term reduction in cost of living. A $5,000 saving is possible, if we invest wisely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing in this budget that addresses a commitment to net zero or long-term cost-of-living assistance for families. Child care was another loser—I mean, the tokenistic approach of saying, 'We're investing in child care but we will build 20 new centres in the region'—out of 151 electorates. I beg your pardon. Sam Mostyn, president of Chief Executive Women, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This so-called 'cost-of-living' budget ignores the reality that, for many families, early childhood education and care is one of the biggest outgoings in the family budget. Right now, there are women who reluctantly say no to extra days of work simply because of the cost of childcare</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave changes are welcome, but it's just tinkering around the edges in getting rid of clearly discriminatory policies. And it still hasn't increased. We still have one of the smallest paid parental leave schemes among OECD countries. It's so insufficient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so disappointing to think that, at a time when we had clear warnings from economists of where the priorities need to be—warnings on inflation, cost of living, wages, and many in this place have made many arguments—ultimately all this is for nothing if we do not address long-term emissions reduction. We need to deliver at least 60 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. There is a clear plan to do it—the five steps to net zero that I've proposed. We can have a strong, new economy—sustainable, circular. But what we need is vision and leadership, and we don't have that with this government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  I applaud the last speaker. As I understand it, she and the other crossbenchers are moving to introduce legislation to ensure that all government vehicles in metropolitan areas will be electric. It's a very simple measure, and yet it will result in a massive reduction in CO2. All buses in metropolitan areas will be electric. Both the motor vehicles and the buses will be made in Australia by Australian owned companies, by law. So you people will not have the right to go and flog off every single asset in this nation to foreigners and to send all of our secondary industry jobs and our primary industry jobs overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The three great elements of the Australian primary industries are cattle, wool and grains. Grains have remained alright. Cattle numbers are down 25 per cent, and sheep numbers are down 72 per cent. Most of the station properties out there are simply empty. As the previous speaker said, if you expended some money in actually sending a little bit of water from the massive flooding of the Clarence River out west then there wouldn't be the massive flooding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my area, which has massive flooding every year, 100-inch rainfall, a little tiny bit of that water going out west will stop your fires, your droughts and your floods out west, because there'll be dams out west, so we won't have the massive flooding out of there either. If you do that, you also overcome the massive problem of invasive weeds. In my electorate, some 12 million hectares—and that is an old figure; it's 10 years old—in fact, it's probably about 15 or 16 million hectares now, of invasive weed has destroyed all natural fauna and flora.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is about cost of living. With all due respect, taking some money off people over here and giving it to people over there does not address the cost of living. Whether you're taking it off future generations of Australians through borrowing or taking it off existing taxpayers, it's got to come from somewhere. If you're subsidising various cost-of-living items and if you are cutting down the tax on petrol, clearly, some people are paying less, and some people are having more money taken off them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very specific, because I need an institute to cooperate with us here. We do not have the resources to do this properly, but we have discovered this. I will use 1990 as a take-off point because Paul Keating had seized control of Australia by the mid-1980s and had fired up his free market policies, which were brought to a flowering and fruition by Mr Costello. The hypocrisy of those two men in stating they were free marketeers, when both of them—and I praise them—allowed the dollar to float. When the dollar floated, it went from 90c to 100c and floated down to 49c or 50c. It dropped clean in half when it was allowed to free float. Both of them had a fit of terror and propped it back up to the 90c to 100c range, thus cheating the farmers out of half of their income, cheating the workers in the factories that produced our motor cars. They took away their jobs and sent their industry overseas. The clothing manufacturing of all underwear was done by Bonds in Australia. The whole of the industry just rolled a swag and left for overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me quote the head of Toyota in Australia: 'Unless Australia is prepared to join the free market systems of other countries in allowing the dollar to free float, then Toyota will have to leave Australia. We are the last car manufacturer, and when we leave there will no motor vehicle manufacturing in Australia,' and effectively no secondary industry in Australia. We can't produce a tyre, let alone a motor car.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me return to food. The cost of food in 1990—by the way, that was the year in which the much-maligned but quite brilliant and extraordinary government of Bjelke-Petersen fell—was $92 per week. It is now $279 per week, a 300 per cent increase. The cost of housing $117,571. It is now $690,220, an increase of 600 per cent. The price of a motor vehicle went up 600 per cent. I haven't got the actual figures in front of me at the present moment, but the price of a motor vehicle went up some 600 per cent. The price of electricity in Queensland was $643, where it had been for 11 straight years, and it had been there because there was no justification for an increase in the costs. There was no justification for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague and very good friend Shane Knuth in the state parliament—he's a member of the KAP, my political party that I belong to—says again and again and again, Mr Beattie said that when we sell off the electricity industry and corporatise it and free market it, there will be competition and the price of electricity will come down. Just the same as the Productivity Commission told us when tariffs and protection are removed, the price of a motor vehicle would come down in Australia. Well, it didn't. It went from $6,000 to $25,000 in that period of time. They said there would be a 25 per cent intrusion into the Australian market. Well, there was a 100 per cent intrusion into the Australian market because we don't produce motor vehicles anymore. This place listened to the Productivity Commission. Heaven only knows there is a very small gene pool in Canberra; a very, very small gene pool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I am elected to the new parliament, I am going to move that the minister and the head of the department and the deputy head of the department will sit in this place whilst we speak on this legislation. They will face the music, as they are forced to do in the Queensland parliament—or at least they were when I was there. They had to suffer the humiliation and face up to the reality of the lies that they had told us. Just remember that they told us that there would be a 25 per cent intrusion into the car market, and they told us that the price of a motor vehicle would go down. The price of a motor vehicle has gone up 600 per cent, and the intrusion is 100 per cent. So much for the Productivity Commission and the advice given and taken by successive governments in this place by the ALP and the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The price of electricity gives me great pain because I was the minister, and we had kept the prices down at $643 for 11 straight years. There is no justification for an increase in that price. We have built one small new power station. All the coal-fired power stations are still there. The price of coal has risen a little bit. The price of wages is very, very small. The cost of electricity has risen a little bit, but there is no justification for $643 going to $3,300, except because the free market forces which were supposed to take it down have driven it straight up. Those of us who live in the real world, instead of the make-believe world of Adam Smith and the invisible hand, know that if you free up the market the big sharks will eat the little fishes. I've got news for my fellow countrymen, my fellow Australians: we don't have any big sharks. The big sharks are overseas, and they're going to eat the little fishes—which is us—very, very quickly indeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me take a town in Australia, a town called Charters Towers, where we were under the wonderful mining act, put there by 'Red Ted' Theodore and the wonderful Labor governments which ruled Queensland for 50 years, God bless them. Then, under the wonderful Country Party governments of Bjelke-Petersen, we were under the mining act. If you wanted to buy a piece of land in Charters Towers, which is about an hour's drive of Townsville—look at it as if it was Ipswich from Brisbane, about an hour's drive—you could buy a piece of vacant land to build a house for $7,000, and it was kept at $7,000 for the 20 years I lived there, prior to the 1990s, when the Labor Party took over. They abolished the mining act, and we moved into the local government regime, which took the price of land from $7,000 a block to $142,000 a block. I must be honest with you: it's settled back to $75,000 for a block of land now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want the answers, look to the paper produced by Malcolm Turnbull, no less, and an Oxford professor, who was an Australian. They did a paper for the New South Wales government on why housing prices are skyrocketing, and they said, 'It's because of the regulatory impositions on the cost of subdivisions.' The biggest subdivision developer in North Queensland, Robert Norman, said, 'I am selling the farms in bulk; I am not subdividing them, because I do not have enough years left in my life to do another subdivision.' And there is no doubt, given the average time for processing a subdivision might be 3½ years, that the impositions they place upon you may make it impossible for you to subdivide. You might have put $1 million out to buy some rubbish land to subdivide it. You put out the million dollars, and they're earning you no money at all for 3½ to four years—you've got to be pretty good to be able to do that. So the subdivisions are not taking place. Whatever else Malcolm Turnbull's shortcomings might be, the report was spot on, and the proof of that was in Charters Towers. When there was a free and open market without regulatory oppression, we had a city full. There's really no industry in Charters Towers; people just wanted to go there to live. You could buy cheap housing and cheap land, have a very good lifestyle and only be an hour away from a very big city, Townsville, which is not all that much smaller than Canberra. It was wonderful, but, of course, that was abolished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us talk about housing. The cost of building a house hasn't actually moved all that much. It might have doubled, but then so have average weekly earnings. The price of a house hasn't really risen at all, but the price of land has gone from zero, if you like, to $250,000 a block. We have the wherewithal in a big and empty country—if you get 50 or 60 kilometres from the coast, there is no-one living there. All the way to the Indian Ocean, there is nobody living there. So the land is worthless, almost. You can run a few moo-cows on it, but that's about it. We can provide housing at one-tenth of the current cost if we remove the government regulatory systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as food goes, if there were competition in the food-retailing industry, which there's not—there are two giants that command nearly 90 per cent of the sales. You can sell to Woolworths and Coles or you can not sell at all. The income for farmers hasn't moved much at all in the last 30 years, but the price of food has gone up 300 per cent. So whether it's food, whether it's housing or whether it's motor vehicles, your policies have failed abysmally.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. With the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022 and the related bills, the Morrison government is delivering on its continued commitment to addressing cost-of-living pressures faced by Australians in a responsible, temporary and targeted manner. This will ensure the low-income thresholds keep pace with increases in the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds apply to the 2021-22 income year and future income years. This increases the maximum low- and middle-income tax offset benefit to $1,500 for a single-income household and $3,000 for a dual-income household. This benefit will be provided on the assessment of taxpayers' tax returns for the 2021-22 income year. It is estimated that over 10 million taxpayers will benefit from the one-off cost-of-living tax offset in 2021-22. The cost-of-living tax offset will put more money in taxpayers' pockets, helping them to meet rising cost-of-living pressures. Recipients of social security and veterans' payments and holders of certain concession cards will be eligible if they are residing in Australia on the test date of 29 March 2022. Each member of a couple will receive the payment if both are eligible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is taking decisive, responsible and temporary action to cut fuel excise and reduce the pressure of higher fuel prices on household budgets and small businesses, while maintaining continued road funding for the states and territories. These changes apply to fuel products other than aviation fuels for six months from 30 March 2022 to 28 September 2022. When the measure ends, the excise rates will then automatically revert to the previous rates, plus indexation that would have occurred on those rates during the six-month period. The benefit available for gazetted oils under the Product Stewardship for Oil Scheme will continue to directly offset the duty rate on these oils. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  Kenichi is a 23-year-old Western Australian man living with Down syndrome. Like many of the people I meet who have Down syndrome, Kenichi is full of vitality. He's living his life to the fullest, with thanks to the NDIS. Kenichi lives with his mum and his dad. He has three jobs: he works at Coles, he has a biscuit-baking business, and he is a Down syndrome ambassador. His job at Coles has been revelatory for the young man and is only made possible by his family, by Coles and, crucially, by the supports he receives from the NDIS. Without his NDIS funding and his carers, Kenichi would not be able to work and would not be able to attend his social group activities. It wouldn't be safe, and that's his parents' No. 1 priority—and rightly so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But to hear his story of dealing with the NDIS in recent times is heartbreaking. Kenichi's parents have told me that in March 2021 Kenichi's mum was called to a discussion with the National Disability Insurance Agency, ostensibly to discuss a $300 shortfall in his plan. She agreed to the meeting, but when she arrived she discovered that it was a surprise full review meeting for Kenichi's plan, seven months earlier than scheduled—a total ambush. Despite the NDIS having no evidence to suggest that anything had changed for Kenichi—that his Down syndrome had been cured somehow—his total NDIS support funding was cut by almost 50 per cent. The family was given no opportunity to prepare for the meeting. There was no rationale to explain why his funding was cut. It was a bureaucratic king hit. It meant that Kenichi was unable to attend his group social activities, because a choice had to be made between his work and seeing his friends. His parents and his therapists have seen his mental health deteriorate since he's stopped his social outings. When you meet Kenichi, you cannot fathom doing anything that would stop him from smiling, but the Morrison government accomplished this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kenichi's is just one story among thousands of NDIS participants who've had their plans radically cut, with no explanation, no procedural fairness, no notice. All MPs, right across the political spectrum, are being inundated with emails, phone calls and letters from NDIS participants seeking urgent assistance after critical funding has been slashed, leaving people who have disability without crucial supports. Huge cuts are being made, with autistic children seemingly in the direct line of fire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government should come clean on its undeclared, undisclosed campaign to quietly slash the NDIS funds of people with disabilities across Australia. But even if they don't, people have already worked it out. Some participants, like Kenichi, have had their funding cut by literally hundreds of thousands of dollars. Others have had necessary residential home mods and assistive technology requests rejected. Many participants and their families are forced to take the fight with the Morrison government to the court, taking the government to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with, where possible, the support of legal aid or an advocate. Most people can't afford lawyers—and nor should they have to. You should not need a lawyer in order to receive a legislated right in this country. But they have to go to court and face a team of government funded barristers and legal experts who are doing the government's bidding to ensure that NDIS participants don't get a cent more than the NDIA are willing to offer them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many other people with disabilities and their families, the exhaustion and the complete lack of faith in the system and in the government sees them take what is being offered by the government to try to make it work. This has meant quitting jobs in order to care for a family member or having a household budget running on empty to ensure that they can keep themselves or a loved one safe. Many parents are also being shamelessly asked why their child has not got better, while others are being belittled in NDIS decisions that say parents are not doing enough to help their child. The Morrison government must stop asking permanently disabled Australians if they are still disabled, if they're still blind, if they still have MS or if they still have autism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should not be a full-time job to handle the NDIS forms. It should not take a lawyer to access an NDIS payment. It is not unreasonable to want a phone number, a direct phone number or to speak to the same person twice in a row at the agency. It isn't good enough to prepare expensive reports to be read by unqualified assessors. Imagine if the Morrison government had to walk a mile in the shoes of these exhausted participants and carers. To say that the NDIS has issues after nine years of a coalition government is an understatement. There are too many heart-rending stories of meanness, too much victim blaming, and too much misery inflicted on people the scheme was meant to help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS was always intended to be a universal right in the same realm as Medicare and compulsory superannuation. The scheme is built on a simple premise: allow people with profound, lifelong impairment to have a choice and control in their lives—choice and control. It was designed to give people with disability and their families options, access, autonomy. It was supposed to open up a world of options to people with disability so that they were no longer treated as second-class citizens, as many previously thought they were. Australia wanted people with disability to have opportunity, just like any other person in our nation, created with bipartisan support so that people with disability had security and their future would not be at the whim of changing government or values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition took carriage of running the scheme in 2013, almost nine years ago. Mr Morrison has said that the NDIS would always be fully funded. He said it as Treasurer, and he backed the scheme publicly as Prime Minister. As Treasurer, in 2018, he said that there was no need for a half a per cent rise in the Medicare levy to fund the scheme because the economy was strong enough to fund it. His loyal foot soldiers have been equally effusive, previously saying that the NDIS is the greatest nation-building project we'll see in our lifetime. How times have changed!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The premise and the dream of the NDIS is still alive. The disability community ensures that. But there is something sinister going on in the Morrison government that threatens the promise that we all made to people with disability years ago. Since early 2021, the Morrison government has put out a firehose of 10 different sets of numbers to justify its claims that the NDIS is unsustainable and must be cut. They've established razor gangs and elaborate and expensive marketing plans, and released so-called independent reviews, all with the aim of stopping people with disability accessing the funds. They say that the scheme costs too much money. They say that the participants are dodgy and greedy, and there are rorts in the system. They don't want participants to have choice and control. They want to exert supreme power so that the minister and the CEO can control the lives of people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House originally had provisions that were unacceptable. We have provided amendments, and we're happy to see the amendments being put forward by the government. To be fair, we wrote them. The government have cut and pasted their names on them so that it looks like they've seen the wisdom. I'm pragmatic; I don't mind whose name is on the amendments so long as we improve the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is a good scheme. It can be improved. Of that, there is no doubt. But it cannot be improved under this government. That this government will improve the NDIS would be the triumph of hope over experience. I say to people with disabilities, to the people who love them and to their families: at the next election, if you are anxious about the future of the scheme, don't vote for the people who have made you anxious—instead, vote Labor at the next election to defend our NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be very clear, Labor wants to see the scheme improved. There's no doubt there are some challenges in terms of unexpected pressures on the scheme. There's not enough community mental health funding, and that's because we need to do more in our schools to fund supports rather than relying on the NDIS. That's also because we have a lack of appropriate housing for people with disability. The government can't be trusted with the management of the scheme. They're spending too much on lawyers and consultants. We don't have enough direct staff. We don't have a properly trained workforce. The pricing mechanisms used in some cases are too generous but in other cases are insufficient for service providers and the workforce to deliver the services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have a clear set of values and principles by which we would improve the performance of the NDIS. But one way you don't improve the NDIS is by constantly making people anxious about whether or not the funding they got this year will be there next year. One way you don't make the scheme more sustainable is by constantly trash-talking the economics of the scheme. This government has given up managing the scheme. It now relies on lawyers and the AAT. It now relies on making it harder for legitimate people to get into the scheme. It's not managing the scheme; it's given up. It's surrendered. That is why at the next election, if we want to defend the NDIS, you have to vote Labor, or you should certainly consider voting Labor.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  It's the morning after the budget, and what a disappointment it is for Tasmanians. Nothing in the budget from last night, that fizzer of a budget, makes up for a decade of attacks on wages, job security and Medicare. Tasmania has been left off the map completely—literally left off the map. The signature regional piece in that budget last night was the $7 billion for priority infrastructure, and Tasmania doesn't crack a mention. Not one dollar of regional priority infrastructure spending will be spent in Tasmania. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the $100 million that's been slated for the Great Eastern Drive on the Tasman Highway in my electorate—and I of course welcome any dollars that comes my electorate—but you pore through those budget papers and there's no detail of when that spending will occur. There's no detail of when that $100 million will arrive. What we know from previous iterations of this government with the way it's handed down previous budgets is that that money will be in the never-never. They've announced funding before for roads in my electorate and in my state, and it's all in the never-never. It's all off beyond the forwards. I challenge this government to tell us when they're going to spend this $100 million in my electorate to improve the Tasman Highway. It doesn't need that funding in three years, four years or five years; it needs it now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  The coalition government's commitment to reducing our emissions is no more apparent than it is in the electorate of Parkes. Last Friday, along with representatives of AGL, we announced a $41 million battery to be constructed in Broken Hill. That is in conjunction with the wind farm at Silverton and the solar farm that's already at Broken Hill. This battery will allow greater efficiency and more reliability for the city of Broken Hill, particularly the mining sector, which relies so heavily on the electricity grid. That's just one of the things that's happening in the Parkes electorate. The Parkes electorate is doing more than its share to carry this country through the export of agricultural and mining resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to reducing emissions, there's the program that we're funding to generate hydrogen from solar at Lake Cargelligo; the cobalt mine at Broken Hill, which will have 450 permanent jobs; the lithium mine at Fifield, which will have a similar number of jobs, providing raw materials for batteries into the future; and the rare earths that are going to be mined from Dubbo. All of these commodities are highly sought after in modern technologies to reduce our emissions. That's not to mention the enormous contribution our farmers are making by sequestering larger amounts of carbon in the soil through their modern farming techniques. The Parkes electorate is leading the way in helping this country reduce its emissions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Before the last election, in 2019, with much hype and fanfare, the Prime Minister promised the people of Perth's northern suburbs a training hub in Wanneroo. Every budget since then has failed to deliver that training hub. Last night was no exception. It's another shameful example of a government that is there for the flashy announcement but never follows through on delivery.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There I was last night with my pen and my paper in hand like a child on Christmas morning waiting to hear what this government would deliver or would promise to the people in Perth's northern suburbs, 65 per cent of whom have to travel outside of the city of Wanneroo for work. For key infrastructure projects, like the Neerabup industrial precinct that will create jobs, there was nothing. There was nothing for the people in Perth's northern suburbs. This government simply doesn't care about creating jobs and developing skills for the people of Perth's northern suburbs and the people in Cowan. Just like with the Wanneroo training hub, there's nothing there for the Neerabup industrial precinct. The expansion of this precinct will create around 40,000 jobs, both direct and indirect, for people in the northern suburbs. But you know what? The only place you'll find a commitment to those people is in a Labor government budget.</span>

This $323 million project has been driven by the Nationals in government in three different jurisdictions. I was part of the state Nationals in 2013 when we put $96 million on the table, and then, in 2016, as a candidate for Nicholls, we were able to negotiate with our federal minister, Darren Chester, and also the New South Wales National Party roads minister to put their two parcels of money on the table at the same time. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new river crossing will transform the region and offer a second crossing in border towns that, for 140 years, have simply been putting up with a single river crossing. Currently 25,000 vehicles a day, including 1,500 heavy vehicles, use the existing bridge. The new river crossing will reduce traffic going through the main street of Echuca by 10,000 cars a day, making it much safer. Most importantly, the new crossing over the Campaspe and Murray rivers will slash operating costs for the freight industry. More than 400 direct jobs and more than 1,100 indirect jobs were created during the construction phase, and many local businesses were able to take advantage of those jobs. The new Echuca-Moama Bridge is a testament to the Nationals in government delivering for regional Australia. </span>

The pressure of challenges is what makes or breaks governments. This government is full of ministers prancing around like toy soldiers, beating their chests and talking a big game on defence, but at every post, at every milestone, at every turn, they have failed—incompetence. Australia should be a partner of choice for our Pacific partners, yet we have the Solomon Islands turning to China for security. Right on our doorstep, China may have a key outpost in the Pacific, on the Morrison government's watch. The government's policy is not the Pacific step-up; it's the Pacific stuff-up. </span>

                  </span>Australia has strong natural advantages as a preferred economic and security partner in the Pacific, but if you sit in the naughty corner at enough international climate conferences, give empty speeches and ignore the existential challenge and the pleas of our Pacific neighbours is it any surprise when you fail on the three Ds—diplomacy, development and defence? They have failed on defence, leaving us with a submarines capability gap for 25 years, and across multiple capabilities we are billions over budget. They have failed on diplomacy, having gutted our embassies and chronically underfunded DFAT for years, doing diplomacy on the cheap. They have failed on development, having cut our foreign aid by $1.18 billion since 2013, blind to the fact that our aid and development assistance is critical to our national interests. Is it any surprise that the Solomon Islands now look to China and not to us? This government has got to go, for our national security. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  The Daintree microgrid project is signed, sealed and about to be delivered. I have fought tirelessly for this project for more than two decades and I am immensely pleased that the construction will start later this year. I could stand here for hours and talk about the microgrid project and the benefit of the hydrogen, but there is a long history in getting to this point. However, I just want to pay tribute to the people who have been with me on this journey from the beginning. I have often reminisced about this journey with Daintree resident Betty Hinton from Floravilla ice cream, who has been with me right from the beginning. Unfortunately, three other people who were involved in the initial discussions over so many years—Lynda and John Nicholas from the Daintree tea plantation, and Betty's husband, Bill—have sadly all since passed away. </span>

                  </span>Finally, I would like to pay tribute to and personally thank long-term Daintree residents Russell and Teresa O'Doherty. They were the ones that really copped a lot of flak over many, many years for their campaigning on this issue. Their unwavering support, their absolute passion in making this happen and their dedication to supporting this project are what has actually made it become a reality. Unfortunately, Russell and Teresa have recently moved out of the area to other places, but there's no doubt that it's been successful because of them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">xpired) </span></span>

He has ignored calls from our business and industry groups and community groups and has completely disregarded the needs of the electorate of Paterson. We have seen no new money to secure the future of GP access, which has been cut. We have seen no commitment from those opposite to fully fund the MRI machine that we have at the New Maitland Hospital, which is currently going through a world of pain in staffing as well, all at a time when people have never been more concerned about their health and, quite frankly, their healthcare system. We have seen no commitment to youth mental health in Port Stephens and no new money to fix the $97 million worth of maintenance backlog for the LGA of Cessnock. Kurri Kurri is in that LGA and the roads are just dreadful. There is no local commitment for our endangered koala population. There is no commitment to Paterson or the Hunter at all from this government.</span>

For more than 35 years, Captain Roc has taught hundreds of students at the Newport Music School, where he is founder. In addition to helping students achieve top marks in the HSC, he has also guided them to accreditation in jazz piano and jazz ensemble exams. In fact, many members of his jazz rock community have gone on to win prestigious awards and accomplish success internationally. Most notably, these include the multi-instrumentalist Ed Wells and Northern Beaches raised composer Matthew Thomson, who recently won the prestigious 2021 National Jazz Award. I applaud Captain Roc for his incredible contribution to the music community. I know that his love of jazz and teaching will continue to touch the lives of many around us for years to come. As Roc so aptly put it:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Australian farmers have seen costs skyrocket. Fertiliser, freight, packaging and fuel have all nearly doubled in the past 12 months and urgent action is required. For example, the biggest generic item sold in supermarkets in Australia are bananas. Farmers who provide work for 25 or 30 people face monthly bills of around half a million dollars. This equates to $1.50 per kilo of bananas before the farmers have any return at all. Farmers receive about 20c less, about $1.30, from the supermarket chains, which charge consumers double that amount—$3 a kilogram. Farmers would save money by doing nothing but sitting around and taking dole payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments need to act urgently. Supermarkets must provide farmers with a minimum price that is higher than the cost of production. Supermarkets equally need to be accountable for the price increase that they charge Australians, particularly when the two major supermarkets have 90 per cent of the Australian food market. They preach to us about free markets. It is not a free market. What I was taught at university is it is an oligopoly. We must demand a strong government that does not provide sugar hits to the Australian public while farmers live off their borrowings from the bank, eating away at their assets until they own nothing and have no income. We demand the government provides real changes to stop this from continuing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have done so much for our local community during my two terms in parliament. We have fixed Oaklands Crossing, which has changed lives. We have done the Flinders link upgrade so that there is a rail line up to Flinders University and Flinders Medical Centre. There is the Darlington upgrade. We have fixed the age-old problem of the Springbank-Daws-Goodwood roads intersection, which is saving people 30 minutes a day one way. We are undertaking the Cross Road and Fullerton Road upgrade. The Mitcham Hills Road corridor upgrade will be happening soon and, of course, the greater Adelaide freight bypass planning study is underway.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in this budget we announced a fix to another age-old problem in the electorate of Boothby, which is the Marion Road upgrade between Anzac Highway and Cross Road. We will be doing a grade separation of the road and the tramline. This is one of Adelaide's worst bottlenecks. It's a road that so many of my local residents have to drive through to get into the city to get to work every day and it is also one of the arterial roads to the airport, so people will no longer be running late for their plane, they'll get to work faster and it will be safer. I'm so proud of what we've delivered.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  This Liberal-National government has neglected the environment at every turn. It has denied and ignored the threat of climate change at every turn. Unbelievably, this week's budget goes further. It doubles down on that incompetence and neglect. One thing that's become super clear through the events of the last couple of years is just how much our wellbeing is inextricably connected to the health of our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it's the rise of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19 or the frequency and scale of unthinkable natural disasters, Australia has experienced what happens when the balance gets out of whack. The harm to human health is enormous, and there is devastating year-on-year impacts to infrastructure and economic activity, yet this budget cuts funding to Australia's clean energy agencies by 35 per cent. From the government that refuses to lift its pathetic emissions target even one inch, we now see the funding for our clean energy agencies cut by more than a third, and there's no commitment to fixing a failed environmental protection framework that has Australia's threatened biodiversity on a trajectory of decline. More and more species are on the brink, and the government does nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people should not put up with this rubbish. The Australian people should hold on to the fact that, if you vote for incompetence, incompetence will continue. We in this country simply cannot afford another three years of environmental and climate change failure, which is all you will ever get from those opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  During the last sitting, I was pleased to advocate for federal funding on behalf of the local government authorities in my electorate for a range of minor capital projects, so I'm pleased to announce that last night's budget delivers an additional $4.84 million in federal funding under the third phase of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program for three local councils in my electorate. The city of Joondalup will receive $1.44 million, the city of Stirling will receive $1.43 million and the city of Wanneroo will receive $1.97 million. This federal funding will support local councils by subsidising the costs of delivering priority local road and community infrastructure projects, supporting local jobs and helping communities recover from the pandemic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an economic stimulus measure, the federal funding enables road and community infrastructure projects, including maintenance, which would have otherwise been delayed. Eligible projects include road safety improvements at dangerous intersections, new or upgraded bicycle and walking paths, community halls, picnic shelters and barbecue facilities at parks as well as projects to support tourism. This additional funding continues to assist every local government in Australia to deliver priority local projects, supporting an estimated 9,000 jobs across Australia over the life of the program.</span>

We've just had the worst decade of income growth since the Great Depression, yet the budget had no enduring solutions for cost of living, no comprehensive childcare solution, no powering Australia plan, no answers for declining productivity, which underpins wages, no free TAFE places and no additional university places. If the government hadn't given $20 billion of JobKeeper to firms with rising revenues, it might be able to address the problems of Australian households. Yet, as always, they put billionaires before battlers. Australians know that a government that's past its use-by date, like a stale product, starts to give off a smell. We are looking at a government like that right now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I am delighted to report to the House we have taken the first concrete steps towards the construction of the Inland Rail project in the Toowoomba region. Last week the first sod was turned at the InterLinkSQ site to commence enabling works for this fantastic legacy project. At this site the western Border to Gowrie section meets the eastern Gowrie to Kagaru section. The $18 million funding agreement between ARTC and InterLinkSQ will see utilities moved and upgraded to prepare for the Charlton site for the Inland Rail line and the planned intermodal hub. It's a particularly important piece of infrastructure for our region. This sets us up as a distribution network for South-East Queensland. It's a win-win that will prevent a doubling-up of works further down the line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The construction is going to be carried out by a local firm, Newlands. This is just the start of the jobs and economic benefits we will see flow into our local economy from this project. Across the state of Queensland, we will see 11,800 jobs at the peak of construction and a boost of more than $7.8 billion to gross state product during construction in the first several years. The Toowoomba region stands to benefit the most from these gains, not just in Queensland but across Australia. As I was saying, there's $5 billion of construction work happening within the Toowoomba region, a fantastic investment that will really set us up. I would like to thank InterLinkSQ for all of their efforts and foresight investing in this area. I remind again: this will provide local firms with work and local people with jobs. It's a fantastic investment, and long may it continue on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Earlier today I met the most amazing aged-care worker. To support her residents when they have dementia, if they are from a non-English-speaking background, she learns their native tongue so that they can have support in their final years. As we know, people who regress with dementia can quite often, unfortunately, lose their English language skills. These people who have dementia need our care and our support, and these amazing aged-care workers go above and beyond to help them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet last night, in this government's budget, there was no commitment to these amazing workers and what they do. There is no extra money in the budget for wages. In fact, they said that many of them had not yet received the bonuses that this government promised them. There is no extra money for ratios to ensure that there is adequate staffing in our aged-care facilities. There is no extra money to ensure that there is a nurse on site in our aged-care facilities 24/7. This government made no commitment last night to fixing the crisis of aged care, despite its own royal commission's report, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, handing down damning findings and demanding it put in ratios to help our aged-care sector recover. If this government were serious about fixing the aged-care crisis then last night it would have put some money in to support these aged-care workers to get the dignity and support they deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Cottesloe Beach is one of the most well-known beaches in Perth. It features on postcards, it plays host to the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition and the iconic Rottnest Channel Swim and even the Beach Boys performed there in 2004. Cottesloe is a destination for locals, regional visitors and international tourists all year round and is a key contributor to the WA economy through tourism. It is one of the most accessible beaches in metropolitan Perth, being within 800 metres of the train station. However, its amenities, accessibility and foreshore features have not had a significant upgrade in the past few decades. This is why I am working with the local council, the Town of Cottesloe, and supporting their vision to address several infrastructure gaps and improve Cottesloe Beach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must stress that the proposed upgrades won't just benefit the local residents of Cottesloe; there are huge benefits which will flow to WA and Australia more broadly. Because of this, I do not believe that the costs of the plan and the vision should be borne solely by the residents of Cottesloe. That is why I am calling on my federal colleagues and our government to support this project and help to deliver a vibrant, enticing and accessible key destination for locals and visitors from across Perth, Australia and internationally.</span>

After almost a decade in power and on the eve of an election, the government finally bowed to community pressure and agreed to fix the road through Wyong.</span>

We launched a petition calling on the government to act, we've held protests by the side of the road and we've supported this campaign relentlessly. The Morrison government have had years to invest in our region, but they've completely overlooked the north of the Central Coast's roads and infrastructure. Now, at the eleventh hour, they've announced plans for rail and roads and to duplicate a section of the Central Coast Highway. But their track record speaks for itself. Locals want to see action, not more announcements or reannouncements.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>): I say to the good people of Swan that the budget delivered by the Treasurer last night outlines the Morrison government's plan for a stronger future. It provides cost-of-living relief for families in Western Australia, creates more local jobs, provides record investment in essential services and will keep Australians safe. The budget delivers cost-of-living relief now, a long-term economic plan that creates more jobs, record investments in essential services and stronger defence and national security.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our temporary targeted and responsible cost-of-living package eases cost-of-living pressures. For the next six months, fuel excise will be cut in half, saving Australians 22c a litre. A one-off $420 cost-of-living tax offset will help over 10 million low- and middle-income earners. In addition to this, pensioners and concession cardholders will get a one-off $250 cost-of-living payment. The budget also delivers the largest improvement to the budget bottom line in over 50 years. Unemployment is at four per cent, the equal lowest in 48 years, and, in inner Perth, it's actually at 2.5 per cent. The budget will see it go even lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget will strengthen our economy, encourage small businesses, increase apprenticeships and invest strongly in manufacturing, infrastructure and regional development. The budget will also strengthen our Defence Force while making the biggest ever investment ever in cybersecurity. Two things you'll never see in a coalition budget are a mining tax and a carbon tax. They are anti Western Australian. So stay the course and stay with the Morrison government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>): The seat of Shortland is suffering a GP crisis because of the cuts by this awful government, which include cuts to the GP after-hours service and reclassification as an area no longer having a GP shortage. What a disgrace! One hundred and forty-nine GP practices in our area are unable to get doctors. Last week, Brooke from Warners Bay told me that it's taking her seven weeks to get an appointment to see her GP. I spoke to a paramedic from Speers Point last week who said that paramedics are under even more pressure because patients can't get in to see their GPs. Swansea General Practice have a clinical room completely empty every day of the week because they can't get doctors. And what's the response from this hopeless government? The minister for regional health has said that Hunter has plenty of medical services. What a joke! And the Liberal's patron senator for Shortland has a secret plan to close GP practices and send people to the public hospital. This is the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals don't care about Medicare. They don't care about solving the GP crisis in Shortland. Only Labor has a plan. Labor's plan is to restore the funding to the GP after-hours service and reclassify our area as an area of GP shortage. Only Labor cares about health outcomes for Shortland. Those on the other side hate the people of Shortland and don't care about the doctors.</span>

They're now a thing of the past. Last year's bullies were not warriors for women. They used the same tactics against women for their own personal advancement. Strong women don't need that conduct in their lives. If the media has now considered more in their commentary and getting both sides of the debate, then that is an important legacy for me to leave behind from these last 12 months.</span>

That's what I can confirm. In the budget year and over the forward estimates, I can confirm that. The Treasurer can add further on the national accounts measure. The reason that is occurring is that, under this government, we've got unemployment down to four per cent. Under this government, we've been investing in essential infrastructure and in our regions and in skills. That is what is driving the Australian economy out of this pandemic at a rate of growth and a rate of employment growth that exceeds the advanced economies of the world, whether it's the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan or Canada. We're outstripping the growth of all of these countries coming out of the pandemic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of that strong growth, we're backing Australians, backing small businesses and backing Australians with lower taxes. We're cutting the red tape, ensuring we're investing in skills. We've got 220,000 apprentices in trade training right now. That's the highest level since 1963. We're investing a record $120 billion in our national infrastructure pipeline. We're getting businesses online. We're getting businesses in the data and digital economy. We're supporting our manufacturers to make things here in Australia, in everything from processing of critical minerals to the manufacturing of important mRNA vaccines in Victoria. We are investing in Australia's future. As a result, unemployment is going down, growth is going up and wages are increasing. It's the strength of the Australian economy which is going to support wages into the future. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:06</span>):  As the member for Lindsay knows and the members of the government know, this budget, as the Treasurer said last night, is a budget for the times. The times are tough, with the uncertainty that we see all around the world, but despite that uncertainty the Australian economy has been coming back faster than we've seen right across the advanced world and all around the globe. Because of that, the budget is in a position that is more than $100 billion stronger, over the last 12 months. The hard work of Australians and the discipline of the government in the way we have managed the budget have enabled us to provide the urgent cost-of-living relief that Australians need to shield themselves from the increases in fuel prices, which put the price of everything else up. Last night, because of the work done by the Australian people and because of the disciplined financial management of the government, we could invest to give them that shield, to protect them from those price increases. We halved the excise—that's cutting taxes—on your petrol. Every time Australians go to the bowser over the next couple of weeks, as that flows into the economy, they will receive and feel that tax relief. They can keep more of what they've earned so they can invest it and deal with the cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that we've put in place the payments of some $250 for those on the pension to help them through these difficult times as those cost pressures are on. And when working Australians earning less than $126,000 a year put in their tax return, from 1 July, they will get an extra $420. It's not our money they're getting; it's their money because it's a tax cut. On this side we understand that Australians should keep more of what they earn. That's what we've delivered in lower taxes, and that's why we're going to ensure that they can keep more of what they earn right here, right now, to deal with the very real cost-of-living pressures that they're facing. This is a targeted plan, this is a responsible plan and this is a temporary measure to deal with the real cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing right now. As a result they can have confidence when they see that relief. They can know that it's been provided for, that they've worked hard to deliver it, because in the last 12 months the budget has improved by more than $100 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That sets Australia up as we come out of this pandemic so that we can look to the future with confidence. We can invest in the regions, we can invest in infrastructure, we can invest in skills and manufacturing, we can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on and we can invest in the security and defence of our nation because we know how to run a strong economy, because a strong economy means a stronger future.</span>

Given that 52 out of 55 of the government's wages forecasts have been wrong and real wages will go backwards at an even higher rate this year than the last budget anticipated, why should the Australian people believe anything the Prime Minister promises on wages, especially on the eve of an election?</span>

In last year's budget, when we made a wages forecast, it actually came in at half a percentage point higher than we had forecast. And, as the Prime Minister has outlined, in the budget year and beyond, we have forecast the wages price index being above inflation. What we know is that the way to drive higher wages is to drive down the unemployment rate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came to government the unemployment rate was 4.2 per cent. When Labor left office the unemployment rate was 5.7 per cent. And I can confirm to the House that the unemployment rate today is at its equal lowest in 48 years, at four per cent, and that female unemployment is at its lowest level since 1974. And in the budget last night we printed a number for the unemployment rate to have a three in front of it for the first time in 50 years. That belongs to 26 million Australians. Unlike those opposite: when they were presiding over the recessions in the 1980s and the 1990s, the unemployment rate remained elevated for some 10 years. This time around, it's taken just over a year to get the unemployment rate back—</span>

                  </a>  The reality is that the best way to drive down unemployment is to invest in the programs that we announced in last night's budget. With a lower unemployment rate, you see upward pressure on wages. Through this crisis we have done everything we possibly can to help save jobs and to help put Australians into new jobs, and today there are 375,000 more Australians in work than there were at the start of the pandemic. That is something that belongs to all Australians, and it's the pathway to higher wages.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last night's budget we announced a $8.6 billion package of measures to ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families, recognising that cost-of-living pressure is the No. 1 topic around the kitchen tables of the country. Cutting the fuel exercise in half will see a family with two cars that fill up once a week up to $30 dollars a week better off and $700 better off over a six-month period. A $420 bonus to the LMITO, low- and middle-income tax offset, will support more than 10 million low- and middle-income earners, which means if you are on $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000, on 1 July and after that when you put in a tax return, you will see $1,500 in your bank account as a result of tax relief provided by this government. Also in the budget was a $250 payment to six million people on income support—veterans, pensioners, carers, people on the disability support pension and concession cardholders, including self-funded retirees. Six million Australians will get that $250 payment, for many in addition to the indexation arrangements, which are also providing cost-of-living relief. Also in this budget was a measure to reduce the cost of medicines to make them more accessible to 2.4 million Australians. So the measures we announced last night were responsible, they were targeted, they were temporary and they were designed to provide cost-of-living relief for Australians who need it most.</span>

                  </a>   It is very simple. The line item there shows the change from last year's midyear budget update of decisions taken but not yet announced, not-for-publication measures. What that means is, when that number goes into the negative, other numbers have gone into the positive. It comes out of that column and it goes into another column—genius! It goes down in one and it goes up in the other column. That is how a budget works.</span>

I would suggest the shadow Treasurer does not phone a friend either, if ever he ever becomes Treasurer, because his best mate on putting the budgets together was Wayne Swan. We all know what Wayne Swan did when he was putting budgets together. He assumed iron ore prices at $180 forever. He had mining taxes that didn't raise any money.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of those opposite who would be responsible for the economic management of this country, there's a Leader of the Opposition who's never delivered a budget. He spent six weeks on the Expenditure Review Committee and never delivered a budget. The shadow Treasurer has also never delivered a budget. On this side, our Treasurer has delivered four budgets. Our Prime Minister has delivered three budgets as Treasurer, four budgets as Prime Minister and one budget as a member of the Expenditure Review Committee. That's eight. I'll put my eight budgets up to your zero every single time, because zero is the amount of policy we've seen from those opposite. We often speak of net zero in this place. The Labor Party is net zero on policy.</span>

Why then have you allowed self-appointed elitists to abolish Bradfield's Hells Gate, reducing it from six million megalitres to two million, from 120,000 hectares of western desert uplands irrigated into $4 billion of annual production to a $300-million-a-year pygmy scheme not out west but adjacent to and polluting the Barrier Reef?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles"> Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:23</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Kennedy very much. I understand his passion. We both have a belief and vision to build water infrastructure. I understand what you're saying about six million megalitres as per your proposed dam, but with Burdekin Dam, which would be about 1.8, and Urannah Dam, at 2.1, we're getting close to 10 million megalitres of water. That starts to put real problems on whether we get the approval through the Queensland government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the member for Kennedy right now: even though Hells Gate Dam was an item of critical infrastructure for the Queensland Labor government, as well as an election promise, as was Urannah Dam, our office is still awaiting any form of correspondence back from them that they have any intention to build either, even though they don't have to put one cent on the table for it. The reason for that, as the member for Kennedy knows, is that the Labor Party is controlled by the Greens. If you want confirmation of that, the member for Kennedy need only wait until tomorrow night, where we'll see whether the Labor Party is going to build Hells Gate Dam, whether the Labor Party is going to build Urannah Dam, whether the Labor Party will put money on the table for Dungowan Dam or whether they will be the party that removes this vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, they don't stand behind the people of Gladstone, they don't stand behind the people of Townsville and they don't stand behind regional towns. They have no vision. They have never built anything of any substance in any of their terms in government for the people who are in this room—maybe in the past, most certainly, the Chifleys and the Curtins, but the member for Kennedy knows that those people are long since gone from the Labor Party. What we have now and what you'll hear in the next night is an apologist to the Greens' sentiment that, obviously, the whole world is complete. All we've got to do is stop and get off; there is nowhere to go. The member for Kennedy is very aware that, if you're going to talk about how you spend money—and they're doing a fair bit of that—you've actually got to talk about how you're going to earn it. That is the fundamental difference that you have seen in the document that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have put forward for our nation. They have made the brave decisions about how we earn the money. They have made the brave decisions on how we stand behind the people of Gladstone, how we stand behind these decisions. But we haven't heard anything from the Labor Party in support of that infrastructure. Yet the gentleman that sits opposite me, the member for Grayndler, used to be the infrastructure minister. Not one piece of our infrastructure, apparently, does he agree with, because he lacks any vision. So, if you want to build Hells Gate, this is the side that's going to build it. If you don't want anything for North Queensland, there's the alternative. </span>

This is a person who has been re-elected by his people four consecutive times. This is a person of vision, and that's what we need. He mentioned ports. Yes, this is incredibly important. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing in ports, whether it's in Dampier, Port Hedland or Darwin, whether it's in Bundaberg or whether it's in Newcastle. We might start with Newcastle, because it's so vitally important. There is $25.1 billion worth of produce that goes out of the port of Newcastle—coal. It's a shame that the people on the other side, tied up by the Greens, don't support the people of the Hunter Valley. The member for Shortland is obviously very close to the Greens. He's got an issue; he talks about transitioning people out of the coal industry—that's making them unemployed. </span>

This is how we pay for the standard of living of our nation. And we talk about the Port of Dampier, with over $40 billion worth of exports. This is so important. The port of Gladstone, where the member for Flynn comes from, has over $28 billion worth of exports, such as coal, alumina, aluminium, liquefied natural gas and agricultural goods. This is how we pay the bills. And we must make sure we invest where we make money. </span>

The regionalisation fund is providing investment in regional infrastructure. There is the Modern Manufacturing Initiative, for strengthening advanced manufacturing. There is the Critical Minerals Accelerator Initiative. There is the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative, because supply chains for food, fibre and minerals all start in the regions. There is the Australian Apprenticeships initiative, the Trailblazer Universities Program and education infrastructure in regional Australia, the national Centre for Digital Agriculture, adoption and innovation hubs, the Recycling Modernisation Fund, the Export Market Development Grants Program, the capability improvement grant and the sovereign industrial capability priority grant. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  The Deputy Prime Minister was talking about our motivation for the investments in our regions in this budget, because only one side of politics will support regional Australia, and it's this side of politics. There has been $100 billion of investment in regional Australia since we have come to government, and last night's budget laid down another $21 billion of investment in our regions. There's been investment in infrastructure, whether it's water infrastructure like the Hells Gates Dam, which can help create more agriculture production that can be exported to the world, creating jobs here at home; whether it's our $1.3 billion telecommunications package to support regional Australia, to deal with black spots and build greater connectivity; or whether it's the work we did in terms of regional health to give more people in regional Australia access to MRI machines when they need it. And regional doctors: we are encouraging people to undertake training as a doctor and to work and live in our regions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's transport infrastructure, like Outback Way. And numerous other programs, like Tanami Road, have been designed to create jobs across the region. As the Deputy Prime Minister outlined, there's a $2 billion accelerator fund, with further investments in export market development grants, in our manufacturing initiative, in our modern recycling plan and in creating more apprentices across regional Australia. Then, of course, there's the $7.1 billion in four priority areas: across the Northern Territory at Middle Arm, in the Pilbara in Western Australia, in the Hunter in New South Wales and then unlocking the potential of the Burdekin in northern and Central Queensland. These are our policies to create the jobs of the future. They're in our budget. They're part of our vision for a stronger economy and a stronger Australia.</span>

On debt and deficit, I can tell him that we've just had the biggest rebound in a budget in 70 years, and I haven't seen a prime minister do that in a very long time in this place. Over the course of just the last 12 months we have had a $100 billion improvement in the budget over the forward estimates, which enables us to invest in the future, definitely, but also to provide cost-of-living relief here and now.</span>

We've got a Western Sydney airport that's being built, which the Leader of the Opposition, when he was transport minister for six years, couldn't get off the ground. He couldn't even get it off the ground, and here he is chipping away, chipping away. He spoke about it for 11 years in opposition, whining, whining, whining about the Western Sydney airport. He had six years to do something about it, and he didn't even dig a hole.</span>

                  </a>  The investments and the economic interventions that this government made during the course of the pandemic saved the Australian economy. They kept 700,000 people in jobs. More than $40 billion of investment in our health response ensured we saved 40,000 lives, and on the global pandemic preparedness index Australia is rated second in the world. That's what it achieved—an achievement of the Australian people that has been barely matched anywhere around the world. We stepped up in the pandemic.</span>

We've even heard it from the shadow shadow Treasurer over there, who is today saying they're going to support the cost-of-living measures even though they don't support them. That's what we've heard from the Labor Party. It's classic Labor Party: they support things just as much as they oppose things. That's why, on Thursday night, I'll be listening out for the alternative budget,Te but I don't think I'll get one. I'll be listening out for it for the alternative plan.</span>

It's important to understand that last night's budget demonstrated that the economy is growing—that growth is higher, unemployment is lower and wages are strengthening. When you consider how far our country has come over the last two years, it is remarkable. At the peak of the crisis, Treasury thought the unemployment rate could be as high as 15 per cent, and the Labor Party set us a task. In their words—in the member for Rankin's own words—the single biggest test for the Morrison government's management of the pandemic would be what happened to unemployment and jobs. That was the test the Labor Party set for us, and I can confirm to the House that the unemployment rate today in Australia is the equal lowest in 48 years, at four per cent. Female unemployment is at its lowest level since 1974. When those opposite came to government, the unemployment rate was 4.2 per cent, and when they left government it was 5.7 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of a stronger economy, we are seeing revenue upgrades which we are banking to the bottom line, with an improvement of more than $100 billion to the bottom line, three-quarters of which has been driven by a stronger labour market. Unlike those opposite, we haven't baked into the budget commodity price assumptions at unrealistically high levels. That's what Labor did. We kept commodity price consumptions at a conservative level so that we didn't put expenditure across those commodity prices. We've seen the deficit, as a share of the economy, more than halve over the forward estimates and then more than halve again by the end of the medium term. This is a responsible budget; there are temporary and targeted measures to ease cost of living and there are measures to improve the productivity and the growth of the economy and create more jobs, but there is also a significant and material improvement to the budget bottom line—the product of an economic plan that is working, that is seeing unemployment come down and seeing more people in work paying tax and less people on welfare requiring payments. That is a sign of a strong economy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the real success stories of Australia's response to the pandemic is the fact that we now see more Australians in work than ever before. There are, in fact, nearly two million more Australians in work than when we came to government. There are 375,000 more Australians in work than at the start of the pandemic. We've seen youth unemployment come down below 10 per cent for the first time in a decade, we have seen female unemployment at its lowest level since 1974 and we have seen the headline unemployment rate get down to its equal lowest level in 48 years, at four per cent. This is not luck; this is the result of an economic plan that has been working: the JobKeeper program that helped save 700,000 jobs; the cash flow boost that helped support small businesses; and the work we did on our aviation industry—we didn't buy an airline like Virgin; we absolutely allowed the private sector to sort that out, and, as a result we now have two strong domestic airlines. But one of the real signs of a strong economy is the increasing number of people taking up a trade apprenticeship, and to see more than 220,000 people in a trade apprenticeship, right now—the highest since records began in 1973—is a sign of a strong and healthy economy. We put in place a 50 per cent wage subsidy, which was really important in giving employees the confidence to keep those workers on. Chippies, plumbers, sparkies—not like Steve Irons!—hairdressers, chefs: apprentices that have been kept on through the crisis and now more apprentices are being kept on. That is a sign of a growing economy, and last night we put $2.8 billion dollars in the budget for further investments in apprentices, which will see $5,000 payments to the apprentices themselves and $15,000 to the employers who take them on, helping to boost the commencement and the completion rates. We are really proud of what the Australian people have achieved throughout this crisis to see us avoid the economic abyss, to see the unemployment rate of four per cent and going even lower. That is a sign of the strong economic recovery that is leading the world.</span>

The shadow Attorney-General asks questions about the Commonwealth Integrity Commission, a policy framework on which we've done detailed, thorough and rigorous work, a nationwide consultative process with 333 written submissions and 46 consultations, and we've got very detailed legislation ready to introduce. I repeat the point that we stand ready to introduce this legislation just as soon as the Labor Party indicates that it wants to work with us to achieve this important public policy reform. We stand ready to do that, but unfortunately we have not seen the cooperation across the aisle that we would like to see.</span>

He's troubled that they have a limited number of employment opportunities. Let me assure the House that our government has committed $172.1 million over four years from 2022-23, including capital expenditure, to establish the Commonwealth Integrity Commission. So I do encourage him to perhaps go and get himself a new wig, and then there may even be an opportunity for him there sometime in the future!</span>

Like all of us on this side of the House, she wants to make sure that we can help to protect Australians online. We want to keep their households safe, we want to keep their businesses safe and we want to keep our institutions safe. As we've seen in Ukraine, a significant number of cyberattacks have taken place on Ukraine. Whilst Australians understand the investment that we've made into nuclear propelled submarines and the money that we're putting into tanks and into additional staff within the Australian Defence Force and additional fighter jets et cetera to keep our country safe, this is the latest instalment in our plan to keep Australians safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pledging about $10 billion over the course of the next decade, because, whilst Australians may not see the activity online every day, our country is already under attack online. We know that there are state actors such as Iran, such as North Korea, such as Russia and such as China who are attacking Australian systems each day. And we've seen in other jurisdictions where they have been able to infiltrate systems, where they have been able to affect the water supply, the energy networks and the telecommunications networks. We realise that we have to invest more into the Australian Signals Directorate, which is part of the Australian Defence Force; they are the men and women who are involved in defending our systems. This is, as I say, a $10 billion investment.</span>

We're putting money into development, along with our partners in space technologies, in AI and in quantum, and we're keeping Australians safe online. We will continue to do so. We can only invest this money because of the management of the budget and because of the management over the course of the last couple of years that has resulted in our ability to keep our country safe.</span>

Yesterday I raised the predicament of the Khan family in my electorate, who had one member approved for a flood relief payment and others rejected. They were without power for 27 days. I provided further information to the Prime Minister's office as requested. Can the Prime Minister confirm that instead of providing further assistance, his government is now demanding that the only member of the Khan family to receive the flood payment pay it back?</span>

This is our second women's budget, and together they have delivered $5.5 billion. This budget supports Australian women at every stage, every age and every walk of life, and we have the serious investment that backs that right in.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The women's workforce participation rate is at a record high. The women's unemployment rate is at a record low. There are more women in jobs—and they're better-paying jobs—than there ever were before. The economic plan outlined by the Treasurer last night will improve the outcomes and opportunities for women, and it will deliver an even stronger and more productive economy. That, of course, gives women greater choice, greater flexibility and greater economic security. As I said, there are more women in highly skilled jobs than ever before, taking up more leadership positions and now holding over 50 per cent of Australian government board positions, compared to 41.7 per cent when we came into government.</span>

So this budget invests nearly $500 million in women's economic security measures to address these barriers, and front and centre is our enhanced paid parental leave for families. It means that eligible working parents can share—</span>

We talked about an enormous downpayment in the last budget of over a billion dollars for women's safety. Once more, we are building on that, investing a further $1.3 billion based on the four pillars of our next national plan, because we understand that in order to work towards ending all forms of violence against women and children we have to have a sustained, collaborative national effort. We have to address the drivers of this violence so that we keep women safe at home, at school, at work, online and in the community.</span>

The support that the government has provided through the Australian defence forces is that right now there are 3,280 Australian Defence Force members in the Northern Rivers, there to support people as right now they go through the unthinkable trauma of facing yet another flood, in a matter of just a number of weeks. In the seven local government areas that have been affected by these floods, the federal government has already made payments of $211,649,893.52—that is in a matter of weeks—delivering much-needed cash and income support for people who've been devastated by these floods. In total across New South Wales, some $2.1 billion, including these investments, has been allocated to support the people of New South Wales who are affected by these floods. Almost $1 billion has also been made available to support those impacted by the floods in South-East Queensland, including the investments we are making with the Queensland government.</span>

I would cast no aspersions on a member of this place for being there or being here. I think that's very important. We are going to continue to stand by the people of the Northern Rivers, of South-East Queensland and of the Hawkesbury, all of which have been devastated by floods, but none more so than those in the Northern Rivers. The response we've made is to get the Australian Defence Force there—after the floods hit in the Northern Rivers, on that Sunday night, on Monday, by lunchtime, the Australian defence forces were winching people off roofs. They moved fast to get in there and help people and to ensure that they were carrying people to safety. I met one of those chopper pilots when I went there, and I spent time with the defence forces who had been assisting those in that local community with the dangers that they encountered.</span>

We are making significant investment in the space manufacturing sector, including $20 million to establish the Australian space manufacturing hub in South Australia, which will create 1,300 jobs. We are also investing alongside Gilmour Space Technologies on the Gold coast. They're a local manufacturer using cutting-edge, world-beating technology, and they're expecting to get their first commercial payload into orbit later this year. I was with them on the Gold Coast just last week. We are investing $52 million alongside them, and it's expected to create 850 jobs, including 350 jobs for local engineers and tradies. As was said by the CEO and founder Adam Gilmour—we saw his brother, James, as well—the space industry has asked for help from the federal government, and the federal government has responded. That is fantastic. Projects like this are how we drive a stronger economy, a stronger future for this country and stronger Australian manufacturing at its core.</span>

It's about working for veterans, serving veterans and supporting their welfare. We've secured $96 million to clear up the unacceptably high backlog of veteran compensation claims. When I said on Saturday there would be $22.8 million as a line item in the budget, that's exactly what there was. When I said that, the budget had already gone to the printers. I also said yesterday that there would be over $73 million in the contingency fund, and there is; $96 million has been secured.</span>

In fact, it will play a very significant role in Australian agriculture by, for the first time in our nation's history, producing more than $80 billion worth of output. To put this in perspective, only about six years ago we were producing $40 billion to $45 billion worth of production, and that is because we have been putting environmental infrastructure around our farmers. Our Ag2030 plan goes directly to that. Our budgets, since announcing our Ag2030 plan, have put over $2 billion towards that environmental infrastructure. Trade is pivotal to us in the Australian agricultural sector. We are a nation of 26 million people and we produce enough food and fibre for 80 million people. So if we don't trade with the world, don't engage with the world, we will not need as many farmers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last two budgets, there has been in excess of $500 million for modernising our training platforms. In fact, for the first time, we are giving our farmers individual portals to be able to identify export opportunities for them at the farm gate—a world first. We are also putting more boots on the ground in embassies and high commissions, breaking down those technical barriers that have stopped us from getting market access, commodity by commodity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are also protecting brand Australia with a record spend in biosecurity, with over $1 billion making sure we protect our borders from pests and diseases decimating Australian agriculture. We are doing that with new technology, as well as by putting more boots on the ground and more paws on the ground. In fact, we are also putting robotic paws on the ground—robotic dogs—in areas that the labradors can't go to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the first country in the world to embrace 3D X-ray technology with artificial intelligence that is checking every one of the 144 million parcels that go through Australia Post. We will extend this for the first time in a trial with New Zealand airports to understand what is in your bag before you leave New Zealand. These are world firsts that we are undertaking.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world firsts do not stop there. We are the first country in the world to protect brand Australia by being able to measure an improvement in biodiversity. Our carbon farming projects will now be able to get not only a carbon payment but a biodiversity payment because we are the first country in the world to be able to measure an improvement in biodiversity. So our farmers will get those payments plus we will be branding their product with a seal for their wheat, their beef and their wool that says to the world that it is the most sustainably produced in the world. This is the environment we are putting around Australian agriculture to grow the jobs and to make sure that regional and rural Australia benefits from a strong agricultural sector well past 2030.</span>

Why has Frank received $2,000 less than New South Wales flood victims? Is it because Frank lives in Queensland?</span>

The answer is, no, that is not the reason. Across New South Wales and Queensland, there were floods of different intensity. In northern New South Wales, there was a one-in-500-year flood, as advised to us by the scientific agencies who advise us on these matters. The member opposite would know that, whether it was in the Hawkesbury or in South-East Queensland, the recovery payments that were made to flood victims were consistent with the disaster recovery payments that have always been paid in response to floods or bushfires.</span>

The floods in northern New South Wales were a one-in-500-year event, and the advice we received from agencies was that those events qualified for an even higher level of funding than has ever been provided before because of the absolute intensity of that flood event in northern New South Wales.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I want to thank the member for Robertson, who's been a great advocate of support for those with rare cancers and rare diseases. Indeed, there was $750 million in the budget last night for the 10-year Medical Research Future Fund plan focusing on rare cancers, rare diseases and clinical trials. In particular, in relation to spinal muscular atrophy, the House will be aware of the case of Rachael Casella and her beautiful baby, Mackenzie. Mackenzie was lost as a young child to SMA, an agonising condition. In response to that, the Prime Minister, in his earlier role as Treasurer, supported the creation of Mackenzie's Mission. That mission provided genetic carrier screening to thousands of families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, this Treasurer, in this budget, made Mackenzie's Mission permanent and universal for all Australian women to offer carrier screening for potential couples around Australia for cystic fibrosis, for fragile X and for spinal muscular atrophy to give parents the option of knowing whether they might be carriers and therefore to proceed to IVF. This will make a profound difference to families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another family and another mother who's had a huge impact on awareness of spinal muscular atrophy. In the chamber, with her hand up, is Julie Cini. Some years ago, Julie lost not just one child but two children, Montana and Zarlee, to SMA. She's been a campaigner ever since. She campaigned for the listing of Spinraza, which this Prime Minister listed and which this Treasurer extended for treatment of SMA. Last night a medicine called Zolgensma was listed by the Treasurer. This medicine is now on the PBS. It would otherwise cost $2½ million, beyond the reach of virtually any family in Australia or around the world. This medicine offers a potential near cure for SMA. For children under nine months, it means that they have a chance of a full life and a rich life, and that will be a legacy that is left not just by those who are on the benches here but by Julie and all those who have fought for Spinraza and Zolgensma at Mackenzie's Mission. These are the practical things that we do. That's what we're doing. Rachael and Mackenzie, and Julie, Montanna and Zarlee are the reason; they are the why. That is why, and these are the people for whom we do what we do.</span>

Anna George has been a formidable figure in the Labor Party's recent history. She began work here in 1989 for John Dawkins when he was education minister and then Treasurer. She went on to work for leaders of the opposition Kim Beazley, Simon Crean and Mark Latham, and then went on to work in the chief government or opposition whip's office for Roger Price, Joel Fitzgibbon and Chris Hayes.</span>

Her knowledge of the parliament and parliamentary procedures is second to none in the building. She always has a friendly demeanour. She organises when people should be in a particular place and makes sure that they're there, including here in this chamber. Anna George is a great human being. We will miss her dearly.</span>

We thank you for your contribution. I thank the government for the indulgence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  The Northern Rivers of New South Wales is an incredibly special place for many of us here; it has a special place in our heart. I know that the whole parliament cares deeply about the fact that in northern New South Wales—whether it's Lismore, whether it's Byron or whether it's other parts of northern New South Wales—they are going through the really quite unfathomable experience of going under water for the second time in a couple of weeks. I know that I speak on behalf of everybody on this side of the House, and I suspect the other side too, when I say that our hearts go out to the people of northern New South Wales, who are dealing with the same things as those in the south-east corner of Queensland, and indeed right around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a real reminder that over the last few years Australians have been through so much together. They've made extraordinary sacrifices for each other and they've been there for each other in the most difficult times. After everything that they've been through, after all of the sacrifices that they've made for each other, the thanks they get from a government which is almost a decade old is a budget handed down from that dispatch box which is defined by falling real wages, a trillion dollars in debt with not enough to show for it, $3 billion in secret cuts that the government won't come clean on until after the election and absolutely nothing that resembles a plan for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgets at their best provide the foundation for a better and more secure future for our people. They provide more opportunities for more Australians in more parts of Australia. They give people confidence that they have a place and a role to play in the unfolding economic success of this country. But governments at their worst at budget time take the problems that exist just before an election and do their best just to shift those problems to the other side of an election. The government are spraying money around and shovelling money around in the hope that people will forget that, for most of the rest of the decade that they have been in office, they've come after people's wages, they've come after their job security, they've come after their pensions and they've come after Medicare. Time and time again, there has been one attack after another on the living standards of Middle Australia. Those opposite, at the peak of their cynicism, think that, if they shovel enough money in the general direction of enough Australians a week or two before an election has to be called then the Australian people will forget the damage that they have done to the living standards of Australians right around Australia. The difference between this side of the House and that side of the House is that we see budgets as the foundation for a better future and we see budgets as the scaffolding of opportunity in this country; those opposite see them as just another political pamphlet to be waved around, when the country desperately needs a plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has taxed more, borrowed more, spent more and delivered less than its Labor predecessor. They like to make comparisons in this place, so let me run you through a few comparisons. We're talking here about the average under this government versus the average under the last government: unemployment under this government, 5.7 per cent, and, under the last Labor government, 5.1 per cent; underemployment under this government 8.6 per cent, and, under the last Labor government, 7.0 per cent; wages under this government, 2.1 per cent, and, under the last Labor government, 3.6 per cent; economic growth under those opposite, 2.3 per cent, and, under Labor, 2.5 per cent; business investment, negative 2.8 per cent under the so-called party of business, and 5.5 per cent under the last Labor government; and productivity, 1.1 per cent under them and 1.4 per cent under us. We left gross debt of $280 billion to this government, and it's heading towards a trillion dollars and rising under those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had enough of these ridiculous lectures about fiscal responsibility and economic management from a government which has underperformed, mismanaged, rorted and wasted at every single turn. This is a desperate, panicked and tapped-out budget from a desperate and panicked and clapped-out government. That much is now clear. There has probably never been a flatter reception to a budget than there was last night, watching the Treasurer deliver the budget from that dispatch box while everybody over there pretended to read their phones or read something else. They slept through the Treasurer's speech because it was such an underwhelming experience. It was underwhelming at best; it was unravelling at worst. The easiest way to work that out, the easiest way to understand that those opposite understand that they fired that one shot in the locker and it was a blank, is the fact that the budget is still not even 24 hours old and the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the finance minister in the other place have spent all their time talking about the Labor Party. Even in the Treasurer's budget speech, and we have seen a few budget speeches on both side of the parliament, there were two or three references to the Labor Party. It can't be that good a budget if those opposite are desperate to talk about the Labor Party when the budget is not even 24 hours old. This is what happens when you have a government which is psychologically and temperamentally incapable of seeing beyond the next election. This budget has a shelf life of six or seven weeks, depending on when the election is. The government cannot see beyond the middle of May and that is how you get a budget which is this underwhelming and which is already unravelling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer says in that monotone, repetitive, focus group sloganeering way over and over again that the plan is working in the hope that, if he says it enough, people will begin to believe it. But the plan is not working if you are a worker in this country dealing with real wages cuts of 26 bucks a week or $1,355 a year, which was what the budget said the real wage cuts are worth this year. The plan is not working if you are one of the subsequent generations of Australians being asked to pay off the interest on the tens of billions of rorts and waste that those opposite have inflicted on the Australian people. Whether it is giving tens of billions to businesses that didn't need support or car park rorts, regional rorts, dodgy land deals or sports rorts, the list goes on. The plan is not working if you have to pay off that debt. And the plan is not working if you tuned in on Tuesday night, last night, and thought you would give the Treasurer a chance to give us a bit of a sense of where the country is headed, what the role of the budget is in that, where the place is for ordinary Australian working people in the unfolding story of this economy. The plan is not working. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of his speech, in that big, self-congratulatory finish, he was pretending to be Winston Churchill and really hoping for more support from the back of his ranks—they weren't listening. He went on and on about how they have delivered exactly what they said they would. I was thinking, 'Who were those guys walking around brandishing the "back in black" mugs before the last election?' Who were those guys? It was the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Remember the black-and-white photos, the 'back in black' mugs and Scott Morrison looking like he was in a small room talking about being back in black? The Treasurer and all the ministers had them and they were flogging them off for $39.95 on the Liberal Party website. The Treasurer had the gall to say, 'We have done exactly what we promised.' What a lot of rubbish. When it comes to the budget, this government have delivered a trillion dollars in debt. They had already doubled the debt before the pandemic. They have delivered more consecutive deficits than any other Australian government since the 1920s. After all that rubbish about debt and deficit disasters, no more lectures from those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer were asked repeatedly today to explain that $26 a week that ordinary Australian people are in the hole, on average—that $1,355 a year. They could not care less about that. In fact, it is a deliberate design feature of their economic policy, as they have confessed in more honest times. Nothing in the budget last night makes up for those real wages cuts and nothing makes up for the fact that those opposite have spent the best part of a decade coming after wages, job security, pensions and Medicare and all the other ways that we have seen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are already seeing through this budget in the same way that they are already seeing through this Prime Minister. This is the guy who thinks that three plus four equals eight. When he is asked about it he gets the big stroppy act on, the big glass jaw and all the rest of it. They are working this guy out. With this kind of performance from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, no wonder the legacy of a decade of this government in office is a trillion dollars in debt, real wages falling, secret cuts in the budget after the election and no plan for the future. Petrol prices will go up in September, the LMITO tax cuts will end after next year and interest rates will go up at some point in the next 12 months. This is the legacy of 10 years of those opposite. We can end the government. The opportunity can't come soon enough.</span>

                  <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  It's a privilege to rise on a debate about the economy, especially after the budget we heard about last night. I say to the House: if your No. 1 attack after a budget has been delivered is, 'The people on the opposite benches were not sitting correctly,' I really think you might be failing in your duty to go through the budget papers and understand what is in there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Facts without context, as the shadow minister just put forward to the Australian public, really don't provide a narrative about what's been happening over the last three years, and I think Australians understand what has occurred over the last three years and what the government's response has been and why we need to do it. The coalition government under Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg's leadership has supported the economy, and that has meant that we have had to spend in unusual ways. JobKeeper and JobSeeker were programs that wouldn't normally come from any Australian government, let alone a coalition government, but they came because of the extraordinary circumstance of the pandemic. I can say to the Australian people and I can say to every member in this House: the government does not regret one cent that was spent on JobKeeper and JobSeeker, because it guaranteed the survival of hundreds of thousands of small, medium and family businesses and supported 700,000 jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when the Labor shadow economic spokesperson, the shadow Treasurer, gets ups and says, 'They've gone into debt,' I think Australians are smart enough to understand that, yes, we have gone into debt, but we've gone into debt to deal with an extraordinary circumstance. We spent at unprecedented levels to support an economy where governments had said: 'You can't open your business. You can't leave your home. You can't go to work.' If the government didn't act, if the government didn't spend, what would have happened to those livelihoods and those jobs? Facts without context are really irrelevant. The context matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Australians know that we made the right call in supporting the economy. When the government says, 'You can't operate; you can't function; you can't live as normal,' of course the government has to step in and support these businesses and the economy. It's only proper. What's important is that the government has a plan for economic recovery, and what you heard last night from the Treasurer was that plan to recover. The coalition has a track record of supporting the economy at the right time with the temporary, targeted, proportionate measures designed to deliver that and to ensure that we do get that economic recovery as quickly as possible so people are able to grow their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's why we're seeing unemployment now fall to record lows. It's not just unemployment; youth unemployment has fallen to levels we haven't seen in many decades. Female participation is at the highest levels we've ever seen. Female employment is at the highest levels we have ever seen. And there's more to come. The Prime Minister has committed that, if we are re-elected, we will see unemployment go into the threes. We'll see youth unemployment continue to drop. We'll see more work being done on getting people into jobs. And that economic plan is working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, of course, world events continue. Global supply chains are pushing up the cost of every single container to Australia. In a trade exposed economy that means five times the cost on every single container coming to Australia which pushes up prices. We know that the war in Ukraine means that oil prices are rising, which means people are paying more at the bowser. So what's important is that a government response through a budget delivers temporary, targeted and proportionate relief, and so we have said and we have announced that it will happen in the coming weeks—that is, a cut to the cost of petrol. This is the right temporary and targeted measure, and it's temporary and targeted because we don't want to add to the inflationary pressures on our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing inflation around the world worse than in Australia. Prices are going up. People are paying more for all goods and services in other countries. It's starting here, and, if the government does something to add to inflationary pressure, that won't help us. That won't help our families. What will help families is a halving of the excise on petrol. Why? Because it's a deflationary pressure on the economy. We know that most of our goods are moved in Australia by truck and road transport. We know that removing the excise by half will actually act as a deflationary pressure, at the same time as providing relief to households and family budgets. It's temporary, targeted and proportionate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, every time the shadow Treasurer gets up and says the debt's too high, that this is the shadow Treasurer who said we should continue the Jobkeeper and Jobseeker programs indefinitely. He said we should never have stopped them. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAWKE:</span>
                  </a>  Certainly, Deputy Speaker. Well, the opposition criticised us yet again, for, in a timely way, removing those supports because it was time for recovery, not time to continue those measures. What would have happened to the debt if the Labor Party had been in office, if they had continued those measures, when at the same time we saw unemployment starting to fall and the recovery on? Again, they have no idea about the real economy in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know now that with the government's temporary, targeted and proportionate cost-of-living measures in this budget we'll see households get cost-of-living relief at the right time. These measures will go for six months. We've also increased the cost-of-living tax offset—a $420 cost-of-living tax offset, affecting more than 10 million low- and middle-income earners. Again, this is the right measure, targeted at the right income brackets, ensuring that we will have not an inflationary pressure on the economy but a deflationary pressure, as well as providing cost-of-living relief. And you can see that every part of this budget is designed to support families, to support low- and middle-income earners, to support small and medium businesses, to support those people who are doing the heavy lifting and getting the economic recovery moving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's without going into detail about our support for the regions. It's a word you don't hear from the Labor Party very often, but the regions are where we get most of Australia's economic activity generated. It's where we will get more jobs growth. The only time the Labor Party cares about the regions—when the shadow Treasurer was advising the former Treasurer in the Labor government—was when they banked record-high commodity prices that were never going to last. Every budget Labor delivered came in under the revenue that they banked at record high prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So imagine the shadow Treasurer standing there and saying, 'I'm worried about the debt and the deficit,' when he worked for Wayne Swan. He says, 'Why are you not paying back the debt faster?' We've got the biggest bounce back, in terms of revenue, of any budget that we've seen for a long time.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAWKE:</span>
                  </a>  Well, I look forward to seeing it. I believe that people are going to look very carefully at this analysis—that we shouldn't have spent money. The Labor Party simultaneously says we shouldn't have spent money, we shouldn't have gone into debt—even though every business, family and household was shut by the government during a pandemic—and then of course we should have kept the supports going after we'd said we were going to remove them when the economic recovery was on. And somehow that would have led to less debt and deficit and the economy would have been sustained! It is pulp fiction, this narrative from the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they stand here and say that their main criticism is that people weren't sitting up straight, or something, in the House, you know they've got nothing. This budget is temporary, targeted at the right people—families, households, small businesses, people who earn a living, the regions, people who drive the economic recovery out there. We're going to continue to support those people through every one of our measures through a budget from the Liberal and National parties that recognises the skill shortages—driving investment in skills, and people moving to our regions and taking those jobs and also being able to start their businesses and having them accelerated through our regional accelerators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing a record rate of apprentice take-up in Australia. That means that now, under this budget, there will be a new $2.8 billion investment to increase the take-up and completion rate of the record rate of apprentices. These are the things I hear when I speak to businesses in Australia, when I hear from the regions—mayors, people I've visited around Australia. They're talking about skills. They're talking about support for business growth. They're talking about getting people into the regions, and that's what this budget will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you ask any Australian community who they would trust to run the economy, we put forward our track record of understanding that it is the economy that drives growth, the economy that drives jobs and that relies on small, family, medium businesses. It's the Morrison government that will continue to support those businesses, to drive that growth, to drive that job creation and to get that record level of unemployment that we're going to see get to three per cent. It will be historic, and a re-elected coalition government will deliver that record unemployment result.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  I'll start where the shadow Treasurer started, giving my thoughts to the people of the Northern Rivers. In particular, I visited Lismore just a couple of weeks ago. With the level of devastation and the fact that people are experiencing that today, we have to do much better in terms of disaster assistance and in terms of helping people in those communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw just then from that performance, somehow, again, this mythology that the Liberal-National coalition are the country's great economic managers. I would say to people tuning into this debate: have a listen to the shadow Treasurer's set of figures that he just outlined around wages growth, unemployment, debt, what happened under the years of Labor governments and the journey from where the economy was to where we are today. That absolutely dispels the myth. I understand that <span style="font-style:italic;">Married at First Sight</span> actually rated higher than the Treasurer's budget, but I was here listening to the Treasurer as, I'm sure, were many Australians. Any Australians who tuned into the budget last night were treated not to a plan for a better future but a plan for just the next 50 days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of wasted opportunity, Australians are now being treated to more of the same. We have a Prime Minister who is worried about nobody's job except his own. This is a government led by a Prime Minister who does not care about ordinary Australians but only cares about keeping himself at this side of the table. And we have a Deputy Prime Minister who spends the early hours of the morning sending out unintelligible tweets, yet delays communicating to his state and territory transport counterparts how their budget phasing for road infrastructure and rail infrastructure projects is going to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister doesn't care about planning for this nation's future, because the only future he cares about is his own. You don't have to take my word for it. You can hear it straight from one of his own senators, who in fact served around a cabinet table with him. We saw Senator Fierravanti-Wells, a senator for New South Wales, say that this Prime Minister 'is adept at running with the foxes and hunting with the hounds, lacking a moral compass and having no conscience'. Even more scathingly, she said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In my public life, I have met ruthless people. Morrison tops the list … Morrison is not fit to be Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no better way than to sum up this Prime Minister and government than that they are only in it for themselves. The Prime Minister is not ruthless to improve this country. He is ruthless in the pursuit of his own personal advancement and power. You could see that last night. There is not a thing in this budget that makes up for the decade of attacks on wages, the stagnant wages growth, the attacks on job security and the attacks on our healthcare system, Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a big cash splash before the election designed to get some headlines, and then there is at least $3 billion of secret cuts—the government won't detail what they actually are or where it's going to make those cuts—to come after the election. They promise one thing before the election but deliver cuts after it. What roads, what rail services, what regional community services and what jobs does this Prime Minister plan to cut after the election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the budget, Australians need a pay rise, not a patch-up job that leaves them $26 a week worse off. If this budget weren't riddled with rorts and weighed down by waste and mismanagement, there'd be more room to support families, to support pensioners and to invest in this nation's future. Having failed to hit 52 of their 55 wage growth projections, the Prime Minister and Treasurer want you now to believe that, this time, they really, really mean it. This is a marketing budget from a Treasurer who made 'back in black' mugs before the last election and is now admitting to deficits as far as the eye can see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Even after this budget, the second-highest-taxing government in three decades will collect an extra $5,275 from every Australian compared to the last Labor government. Just think about what an average family could do today with that extra $5,275—what that would mean to a family and how that would change lives and make it easier to cope with the skyrocketing costs of living. This is all at the same time as the Treasurer was forced into the humiliating backdown on car park rorts in his own electorate. This is not a budget for the future; it's a budget for the re-election of the Morrison government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:50</span>):  The shift into the regions is indisputably on, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> writes today. Regional Australia grew by 70,000 people in the year to 2021, while the capital cities population fell by 26,000. The big move is on. The great advance to the west is on. And the reason why people want to move to the regions is that the regions are a safe place in which to live. With better telecommunications, better transport links, better health services and better amenity, the regions are the place to be. You and I both know that, Deputy Speaker, because we live in the regions. We love the regions, and the regions will continue to draw and attract people from capital cities because the regions are a great place in which to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The regions are also a great place for people to live because of the policies that have been put down by the Liberal and National government. The Liberals and the Nationals have put policies in place that have made the regions even more attractive. Last night's budget, delivered by the Treasurer, was a budget for the regions. It builds on previous budgets that Treasurer Frydenberg has announced, previous budgets that Treasurer Morrison announced and previous budgets that this government, this side of parliament, has put in place to recognise and acknowledge the fact that the regions are going to drive investment and help our balance of payments into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really delighted that the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, a program that I announced on 22 May 2020, has been extended by another half a billion dollars. For my electorate, that means $13.8 million is going to go to the 12 local councils that I proudly represent in this place. But right across the nation that is going to mean substantial investment in projects which aren't necessarily the big-signature items but which are so important to local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer talks about job security. It was the shadow Treasurer who said, when COVID first hit these shores, that this government would be judged on how it handled the COVID crisis with job security. Indeed, we're second in the world, as far as the ratings go, in terms of how we have handled the coronavirus. Look at our unemployment level. It was 5.7 per cent when those opposite left power. What is it now? It's four per cent—less in the regions. They're the jobless numbers. Indeed, the Regional Australia Institute identifies more than 72½ thousand jobs in the regions right now. If there is a job in the regions, for all sectors, it is available right now. There are many, many jobs. Go up to the high streets and main streets of country towns and regional hubs and you will see job advertisements saiyng, 'Hiring now; inquire within,' on the shop windows in our central business districts. That is because we are looking to employ people. We want people to join that great rush to the regions. We want people to come and share in all of the great things that are in the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest that there is any sort of attack on wages or job security is just piffle. It is just nonsense, and the member for Rankin knows it full well. Job security is definitely there, because there are jobs available. The jobless figures are very good. They are the envy of the Western world because of the economic policies that we as a government have put in place. Just last night, in the budget, we saw that taxpayers, particularly right across the regions, are going to benefit from the low- and middle-income tax offset and the cost-of-living tax offset. In my electorate of Riverina, 61,700 taxpayers are going to benefit from those measures. The fuel excise: 22c per litre for every tank of fuel. We know that country people drive more than city folk; that's just a normality. Driving kids to school, driving kids to sport, driving to and from work—it's expected that they drive more kilometres. Indeed, in the Riverina and Central West, it could mean a saving of $30 per week for a family with two cars, or $700 over the six months of the program—a good announcement, a good budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  In five weeks time, the early voting polls are going to start opening. Members of the coalition will ask the people of Australia to vote for a Prime Minister whom their own Deputy Prime Minister has called a hypocrite. He has actually said a lot worse things than that, but the rules of parliament require that I cannot use these words. The former Premier of New South Wales has described this person as 'a horrible, horrible man'. A current senator from New South Wales has described the Prime Minister as a person without a moral compass, who is not fit to hold the office of Prime Minister. The most remarkable thing about each of these people is that they all know the Prime Minister a lot better than anybody else on this side of the House and much better than just about any other Australian. So if the people who know the Prime Minister best are saying that he can't be trusted, that he is a horrible, horrible person and that he is not fit to hold the office of Prime Minister, how on earth can the people of Australia say that this guy is worth a second decade in office?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any one of these criticisms should be fatal, but that is not the case on which the Australian Labor Party says this rotten government should be thrown out of office. They are all character flaws, indeed, but the principal argument that we will be taking to the next election is that they should not enjoy a second decade in office because, frankly, they are just incompetent—rotten to the core and incompetent. They stand here and talk about their own superior economic management, but they have delivered to the Australian people the three largest budget deficits in our nation's history and $1 trillion worth of debt. We are coming close to the point where we will be spending as much on interest payments repaying this government's debt as we spend each year on Medicare. These are eye-watering amounts of money, and yet this mob over here try to lecture us on economic management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say that the economy is coming back. They say, 'Just trust us with three more years; the good times are just around the corner.' Well, if you're an Australian sitting around the dinner table and you want to measure how the economy is going, there is only one thing you are thinking about: 'Are my wages going up? Is there more money coming in to meet the costs of our family budget or less?' You do not have to listen to the member for Rankin. You do not have to listen to me. All you need to do is read the government's own budget papers. It's there in black and white.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>In this year alone, real wages went back by a whopping 2.75 per cent—that is, by the end of this year, you will be nearly three per cent worse off under this government's economic plan then you were at the beginning of it. They talk about economic recovery and good times being just around the corner, but you'll be 2.75 per cent worse off at the end of this year than you were at the beginning. The member for Rankin said the number is $26 per week, and the Prime Minister says, 'Don't look at that; look over here!' He's the ultimate sideshow huckster. We won't have any of this. The Australian people, if they want a pay rise, will have to vote for Scott Morrison not once but twice, because under the government's own budget papers it's going to take over three years before they see an increase in real wages. So the economy supposedly improving means nothing to the ordinary Australian family until they see their real wages going up, and under this mob there's a plan for them to go backwards. So, whether you vote against the Prime Minister because he's got no moral compass or because he's a horrible, horrible person or, in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, he can't be trusted and he's just a hypocrite, or whether you vote against him because your wages are going backwards, this mob have to go. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  It appears to me that Labor is stuck in the past. They do not understand the fundamentals of a modern economy, nor do they seem to understand that we have been through a global pandemic with an economic shock that has not been seen for more than a century. It's important for us to understand that we, on this side, get economics. We get finance. We understand that one of the best ways to increase wages is to decrease tax. That means that families, individuals, Australians can take home more pay. We understand this. This is fundamental to the way that we approach things, and we have been doing this from the very first time that I came to this House. I'm very proud, as a member of this 46th Parliament and a member of the Morrison government, that we have been supporting tax cuts from the get-go. We have been supporting them to ensure that Australians keep more of what they earn in their pocket. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have legislated more than $320 billion in tax cuts, including more than $130 billion through stage 3 tax cuts. In fact, it was the very first thing that I voted on as a new member of parliament and something I'm enormously proud of. We've provided more than $40 billion in tax cuts, which have now flowed to more than 11 million Australians since the start of the pandemic. And around $12 billion in support will flow to more than 10 million Australians when taxpayers lodge their tax returns from 1 July 2022. More than $16.5 billion in tax cuts will flow to more than 12 million Australians in this next financial year because of our permanent tax cuts implemented in the 2020-21 budget. More than $93 billion in tax cuts will flow to more than 13 million Australians over the three years in the forward estimates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean? What are the practical implications of these massive tax cuts for the Australian people? Someone who's on a median income and earning around $60,000 will be $7,980 better off by the end of this financial year compared with the 2013-14 income tax settings. An average full-time income earner on around $90,000 will be $8,655 better off by the end of the 2022-23 financial year compared with the 2013-14 income tax settings. So we understand the fundamentals that tax cuts mean Australians can take home more pay, and that means they have more spending power in the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast Labor took $387 billion of higher taxes to the 2019 election—$230 billion in higher personal income taxes, $57 billion in higher taxes for retirees, $31 billion in higher housing taxes, $27 billion in higher family business taxes and $34 billion in higher superannuation taxes. The people of Higgins told me that, right there, that was a tax on their aspiration—their aspiration for a better life for them, for a better life for their family, for a better life for the prosperity of Australia. And that's because Labor has a fundamentally different approach to finance and the economy. It's in their DNA. They think it's Labor's money. They don't understand that it's the taxpayer's money. The government is spending it on behalf of the taxpayer. That is an absolute fundamental. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the biggest economic shock this country has faced in a century, we have been working hard to make sure that more people are in work. We understand the dignity of work and how important it is for people to have a job. As a result of the work that we have done through our measures through COVID, including JobKeeper, the cash flow boost, the instant asset write-off—all the things we have done to support businesses—we now have unemployment at four per cent, the equal lowest in 48 years. That is nearly two million more Australians in work today than when we came into government. This is something to be so enormously proud of, because this government understands fiscal responsibility, the economy and how to do the right thing at the right time at the right place in our history.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  This morning, a number of Labor members and I went to the front lawn of parliament to meet with aged-care workers. They're here in Canberra to protest their lousy wages and conditions and the neglect of their industry by the Morrison government. These people—predominantly women—are Morrison's forgotten Australians. They perform one of the most important roles in our society, looking after our frail, our elderly and our most vulnerable. They're overworked and they're underpaid. Some of them are working two and three jobs just to get by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The title of the report handed down by the royal commission that was instigated to look into our aged-care system had one word: neglect. If you ever want an indictment on a government and their approach to aged care, look no further than the title of that royal commission report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. It talks of substandard care, malnutrition of residents, skills shortages, workers underpaid and overworked, a system in crisis. What did the Morrison government do in last night's budget to help those aged-care workers? What did they do to boost the wages of struggling aged-care workers in our economy? Nothing. They did nothing. There is no support for their wage rise, which is going through the Fair Work Commission at the moment. There is not even any indication from the government that it will fund any wage increase that the Fair Work Commission might deliver in their wage case. Instead, they get an $800 bribe from the Prime Minister to try and stop them fleeing the industry, a bribe that many of those aged-care workers tell us hasn't even been paid yet. The Prime Minister promised it months ago, and it hasn't even been paid to them. As one of them said to me, 'It won't even be a week's worth of rent.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this say about support for workers in Australia and their wages? This is a government that deliberately goes out of its way to suppress workers' wages. Do you remember the cuts to penalty rates for hospitality workers? Did this government step in to support hospitality workers, given the fact those workers were taking home less money to their families each week? No. The government supported that cut to penalty rates. When Qantas sacked 3,000 of its staff and contracted out their work to a foreign corporation that then brought workers in on lower wages and conditions, do you think anyone in the Morrison government spoke out against that? Of course not. What about when workers in the mining sector took action against their employers because they were working next to people who were employed by labour hire companies as casuals, with lower wages and conditions yet doing the same job as miners working beside them on a daily basis? Who do you think the Morrison government supported in that court case, when those miners and their union went to court to try and get justice for those workers? It wasn't the workers. The Morrison government intervened in that case and backed the employers. It says everything about their approach to workplace relations. They even have a government wages policy that deliberately restricts wage increases in the public sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Never forget that this is the party of Work Choices. This is the party that brought in individual contracts so that workers could be ripped off by tearing them out of their union collective bargaining agreements and paying them less. It's a fact—one that Australians understand—that the Morrison government and every other Liberal and coalition government that has come before it never support workers. They never support higher incomes for workers, and they never support wage increases for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The result in Australia is that real wages have been falling—and falling dramatically—under this government. In 2021, inflation was running at 3½ per cent on an annual basis, but wages only increased by 2.3 per cent. For the average worker on an income of $68,000 a year, that's an effective pay cut of $832 a year. Did the government do anything in the budget last night to alleviate any of that pressure that workers in Australia are feeling? Of course not. That's why Australians are unhappy, that's why Australians are angry and that's why Australians are not buying the ribbon-cutting budget that was introduced by this government last night. They've ignored the pleas of hardworking Australians for support when cost-of-living pressure is going through the roof but wages have not been increasing for the last decade. We've seen in recent months that the Prime Minister of Australia cannot walk down the street in a place like Lismore, because he knows he is going to be abused and harrangued by the Australian people. That says everything about his standing in the community. When the Prime Minister can't walk down the street, it's time to give someone else a go.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>): I want to start by joining some other contributors in acknowledging the terrible situation in northern New South Wales. In particular, I'm thinking of the people living in Alstonville, a town I lived in for a few years as a child. I went to Alstonville Public School, so I'm very concerned about what is happening there. I wish them and those needing to evacuate, and all the people who are helping in those communities, all the best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the opportunity to talk on this matter of public importance, which is about economic management, the state of our economy and where it is going. This is going to be central to the upcoming election campaign. I look forward to the opportunity on the campaign to be talking about our economy, where we are, where we've come from and where we are going. That's what last night's budget that was handed down by the Treasurer underpinned. We know full well the challenges that we have had to meet over the past two years in confronting the most significant economic risk and circumstance since probably the Great Depression, certainly the greatest challenge to our nation since the Second World War. I'm very proud of all of the elements of our economic response to the pandemic, such as the restrictions that had to be put in place and the economic support that flowed from that to make sure that our economy could survive those restrictions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the budget that JobKeeper was central to saving hundreds of thousands of jobs and supporting hundreds of thousands of businesses in my electorate of Sturt. I still come across people all the time in my electorate who talk to me about how vital having access to JobKeeper was for them to keep their business going and, of course, to keep people employed and connected to those businesses. There were the increased JobKeeper payments. The HomeBuilder program was an absolutely fantastic scheme that has been transformational for so many people to access housing, the great Australian dream, which the Liberal Party has always championed. Over decades when in government, the Liberal Party has been responsible for helping to support people to get into a home. We know how important that is. The HomeBuilder scheme was absolutely fundamental to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government did what was necessary. We spent money that was necessary to support our economy and to support consumption in the private sector by providing government stimulus. We now find ourselves in a situation where we have recovered. We are rebuilding. We have more people employed in our economy than before the challenges that the pandemic beset us. That has put us in a position to do the things that were announced in the budget last night, which give people a great sense of optimism for the future whilst recognising that there are challenges, particularly around cost of living and meeting those costs. That's why our budget ensured that we put in place a range of measures to help support people who are struggling with inflationary impact, particularly when it comes to fuel, which is of course outside the control of anyone in this country or anyone in this parliament. International forces are at work there, but, nonetheless, we recognise the need to support people. In particular, the halving of the fuel excise for the next six months will be of enormous benefit to my constituents and people across the country in meeting those cost-of-living challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The exciting parts of the budget are the forecasts around unemployment continuing to fall. It's already at four per cent, going into the threes and breaking records that, in some cases, are more than 50 years old. That is not only because of the important decisions that we've made over the past few years and the position the Australian economy is in now but because of the measures in the budget and what they are going to do to keep supporting employment growth in this country into the future. That's what underpins our ability to do absolutely anything else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're proud of what we're investing in essential services. I'm particularly proud of what we're doing in national security and defence. My electorate is a significant beneficiary of the sovereign defence industrial capability that we've invested in and are continuing to grow in this country, as are many other electorates across the country. But all that comes from a strong economy. All that comes from creating jobs and increasing the taxpaying basis so that we can provide the essential services that people need. We are a government that is doing that. I am very excited to get this campaign underway in a few weeks time and be out there in my electorate, like other members from the government will be doing right across the country, talking with pride about the decisions that we've made and the policies that we've put in place, particularly those in the budget last night, and what they mean for every Australian, giving them a future to be excited about and economic security that underpins their ability to plan for their future.</span>

He's a bricklayer, a single dad with two kids. He said it doesn't matter how much overtime he does; he still finds himself struggling to make ends meet at the end of the week. Then I turned around and spoke immediately to a single mum whose kids have left home and who is a public servant working from one short-term contract to the next. She told me that that very day she'd finished one short-term contract, and on Monday morning she'd be turning up to the Centrelink office to sign up. She hoped she'd be able to get another short-term contract, because if she didn't she didn't know how she'd be able to continue to pay her mortgage.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost of living is a new issue to the Liberals, and they think it's a temporary one. That's why so many of the cost-of-living measures in this budget have a shorter use-by date than a frozen pizza. We've got the cash payments that go out on a one-off basis in April. We've got the tax bonus that just happens in July and then it's done. We've got the petrol tax relief, which is over in September. But for most Australians cost of living isn't a temporary issue from month to month; it's an 8½ year issue under the Liberals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just an issue about the consumer price index; it is an issue about the gap between prices and wages. As my friend Barbara Phi liked to put it, for so many Australians it feels like there's more month than money. Fundamentally, the issues we're facing under the Liberals are issues of shared prosperity. You can see deep concern from policymakers right across the economic spectrum. Christine Lagarde spoke of what she called 'the third milestone: inequality and the quality of growth in our future world'. Amartya Sen and John Rawls have talked about the importance of egalitarian growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend and mentor Tony Atkinson wrote a book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Inequality: What Can Be Done?</span> One of his really important insights out of that book was that there isn't always that trade-off between growth and equity that Arthur Okun talked about, but that a lot of policies can be good for equity and good for growth. That's at the heart of Labor's cheaper childcare plan, our Powering Australia plan, our commitment to free TAFE places and tens of thousands of additional university places, and our commitment to roll out the National Broadband Network. All of that recognises that, when we grow Australia from the middle out, we see the kind of egalitarian country that holds true to Australia's values: to a country where most of us don't stand up when the Prime Minister enters the room, where many of us sit in the front seat of taxis and where we prefer the word 'mate' to the word 'sir'. If we want an egalitarian Australia with strong middle-class growth then we need more than the trickle-down philosophy that has embodied the Liberal's 8½ years in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need real plans, such as Labor's plan to deal with problems in productivity, which have plagued this government and seen productivity go backwards. In the long run, productivity is the central driver of wages, yet under the Liberals we haven't seen that investment in competition reform which underpins a dynamic economy. We see no action on multinational tax avoidance in this budget, which we know is important to creating a level playing field and building an egalitarian Australia. Labor is committed to shared prosperity, and a Labor government would produce a budget far stronger and better for growth than the one we saw last night.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Social and Community Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Labor's got a big test tomorrow night, which I suspect they're not going to rise to the occasion of. The Leader of the Opposition, for three years, has criticised everything and supported everything. We saw that again last night in response to the budget. We saw the Labor Party calling the budget a cash splash and criticising every aspect of the economic plan, yet when we woke this morning we heard from the Leader of the Opposition that they will be supporting the cost-of-living relief in the budget—that it's terrible spending, terrible tax expenditure, but they'll support it anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has hidden for three years, but you can't hide a more-than-20-year history in politics. You can't hide the fact that he's the most left-wing leader that the Labor Party has had, probably, since Whitlam. He could be further to the left than Whitlam—who knows! But he's trying to hide everything he stood for before: higher taxes, higher income taxes, higher taxes on retirees, higher taxes on housing—every conceivable higher tax, including death taxes, which he supported at one point in his career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has not said a thing for three years. He's shamelessly carped for three years. It's been a relentlessly negative opposition in the midst of a pandemic—relentless negativity from this Leader of the Opposition, who has not spelled out what he would do, and tomorrow night is his opportunity to outline an alternative budget. But we already see the Labor Party starting to sow the seeds: 'Oh, we will just talk about some principles tomorrow night; we're not going to outline an alternative budget.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the Australian people will expect, because from this government they've seen a plan to continue with the economic success of this country, a plan to ease the cost-of-living burdens that they have been facing in recent times, particularly since we've seen global supply chains being impacted not just by the pandemic but also by the war in Ukraine and the aggression from Russia. The Labor Party can't on the one hand criticise every aspect of the budget and on the other hand support it. This is what the Leader of the Opposition has done now for three years.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SUKKAR:</span>
                  </a>  Labor, including the member who is interjecting, went to the last election very proud of their $387 billion of higher taxes. But now they've all had a conversion on the road to Damascus: 'Oh, no, when we said that we supported the retirees tax, slugging Australian retirees, or our housing tax, or our superannuation tax, or our family business tax, we didn't really mean that. No, we've all had a great conversion.' The Australian people know that, and the Australian people are far too smart for the Labor Party. They know that the Labor Party truly believe in those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their unwillingness to outline what they would do, their unwillingness to outline an alternative budget tomorrow night, is a very convenient way to try to sneak into government without saying anything and then have all of those higher taxes in their back pocket. I don't think it's going to work, quite frankly, because I don't think the Australian people are going to write a blank cheque for the Labor Party. I don't think they're going to write a blank cheque for the weakest economic team that we've probably seen in an opposition in this country—an extraordinarily weak team with a Leader of the Opposition who's never delivered a budget, who sat on the Expenditure Review Committee for all of six weeks and who spent six years doing nothing in the most dysfunctional government that Australia has seen. We've got a shadow of a shadow Treasurer who was Wayne Swan's brain. He took that as a compliment when I used it in the House once upon a time. It's not meant to be a compliment, I assure you, being Wayne Swan's brain—the shadow Treasurer who wrote the immortal line, 'The four surpluses I announce tonight', which is seared on every political boffin's mind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Labor Party have a big test tomorrow night. We think they're going to fail that test, but we hope they rise to the occasion and outline an alternative budget and their plan for this country—which they don't have.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard some big words in the Treasurer's budget speech last night, with the outrageous suggestion that under the Morrison-Joyce government the NDIS is always fully funded. We know that that proposition can be taken with a grain of salt. But what I want to talk about—and it is squarely in the middle of this second reading amendment—are the cuts to people's plans that are happening daily and that you can't see in the budget papers but that anyone who actually listens to their constituents surely must know are happening—the cuts like those to the NDIS plan of a young autistic man in my electorate, who is about 21. He has mental health problems. He has problems interacting with other people. His father came to talk to me at a coffee catch-up I had at Frankie's Cafe in Carrum Downs recently to tell me that when his son was in high school his life was going to a special school and then coming home and going into his bedroom and just sitting there at the computer screen until his parents made him come out to eat dinner, and then he would go back in and look at the computer screen again. He couldn't really have a conversation, even with his own family, and he was struggling to interact with other young people around him because of his disability. And the NDIS was a godsend, as the Gillard government always intended it to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the plan he had with the NDIS, this young man got to access not just social workers and support workers for when he was in the community but also counselling. He got to access psychologists, counsellors and allied health professionals, who helped him to know himself, to get confidence and to be able to interact. As his father said to me, the difference was like night and day. He not only was able to interact at school but would come home and talk to his parents about his day—not hide in his bedroom because he just didn't know how to handle social interactions. He got a job with a disability employment service in a warehouse and was so proud of himself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you can imagine the reaction of this young man's family when the NDIS plan for him was cut because he was doing so well and surely he didn't need any of these services that had given him that capacity to be able to do so well. That was the really skewed logic that was used. What happens when you have a young man whose access to counselling, social workers and people who can take him to and work with him at the disability employment service is taken away from his NDIS plan because, under this Morrison government, that's the way the cuts that you can't see in the budget happen? What happens to this young man? He retreats back into his bedroom. His life becomes narrower and darker yet again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts to NDIS participant plans hurt NDIS participants and hurt their families. I received an email today at 2.08 pm, while we were in question time. Should anyone on the government benches think that this is not a real issue that is really happening to people in our communities, I received an email at 2.08 pm and I haven't had the chance to speak to the woman who emailed me, so I won't use her name, but I will read out the email: 'Hi, Peta. I just wanted to share my experience with you regarding what was supposed to be a routine NDIS review for my daughters. I have been emailing back and forth with the local area coordinator (for context, every review has been a different LAC) about the girls' upcoming expiry of their plans and what to do for their next plans. I had said I was looking to just roll them over for 24 months, and I was happy with both of their plans at this stage because their needs hadn't greatly changed. I was told that that just wouldn't be possible unless I had reports to back up a rollover. So I got what reports I was able to and I forwarded them to the LAC. I also sent her a statement about each girl, their disabilities and needs, and what they had been doing with their last plan. At this stage, the LAC said this was fine and she would look to roll over both plans. Then I got a phone call saying we needed to set up a phone plan to update the girls' details because the details were three years old.' One would have thought the details of young girls who live with their family would have been pretty easy for the local area coordinators to be able to understand. The email goes on: 'So I did that, only to be ambushed and told that their swimming would no longer be funded, even though I provided evidence about the physical issues they both had. Then I was told for my older daughter, Isabella, who has Down syndrome and autism level 3, support hours would most likely not be funded as the NDIS just wouldn't go for that many hours.' She has Down syndrome and autism level 3 and had been receiving those support hours previously. My constituent goes on: 'I explained that I work two days a week. She can't be left alone at all, and in school holidays she obviously needs full-day support. The LAC said, "Why can't you just put her in a holiday program?" I found it quite extraordinary that there was a lack of understanding of the limited places in programs, or the fact that they don't run all day, or the fact that the activities are not always suited to all disabilities. I have to say this was a very different experience to every other NDIS review I have ever had, and I have to ask: what's changed? This felt like an ambush and me having to justify my girls' needs, which is just disgusting.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has changed since the NDIS was introduced in a nation-changing and life-changing reform by the former Labor government? Well, what has changed is the government. What has changed is the actual genuine attitude to maintaining and rolling out a program that is there to make the lives of people who have disabilities and their families and loved ones just that bit easier. After nine long years of a Morrison-Joyce government we have seen the creeping and unjustified attacks on NDIS participant plans through a lack of transparency and through cuts to programs that have helped people have the life that they deserve all under the guise of flowery rhetoric and the thumping of tables in speeches for budgets about fully funding the NDIS. It is not just not fully funded; it is not being run properly for the people that need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 500,000 Australians on the NDIS, but under this Morrison government their attitude is that there are too many people with a disability getting this help and that it costs too much to care for them, and that is not right. There is an economic impact of the NDIS for every Australian, for every community. The NDIS employs more than 270,000 people in over 20 different occupations, and it contributes to the employment of tens of thousands more workers indirectly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In one of the final opportunities I will probably have to speak on something as important as the NDIS in this chamber what I want to give to my community is this message: I will always fight for you and your access to this life-changing, truly reformative scheme, and I will always fight for this life-changing and truly reformative scheme to be as strong as it was always intended to be and that it needs to be for you. The way that you can guarantee that you will have an NDIS that is not just fully funded but that is transparent and that is administered by a minister and a government that care more about people's lives than cutting budgets is to vote for an Albanese Labor government at the upcoming election.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  There is absolutely no doubt that the NDIS is not functioning as it should under this Morrison government. There are too many people who are tied up in red tape, who are tied up in reviews and who ultimately end up with decisions that they don't understand and that leave them without the supports they should have. In fact, the latest NDIS quarterly report shows the average NDIS plan budget fell by four per cent in 2021 to about $68,000. Before that, the average plan had, in fact, been increasing each year since 2018. This is significant. This number represents what the member for Dunkley was just talking about and what so many of us are hearing from people in our communities—that plans are being cut, that supports are being cut. It seems to be a case of cuts by stealth, of independent assessments by stealth. Independent assessments that the disability community fought so hard against and which this government said were no longer on the table seem to be happening by stealth, and the impact of that is serious for people who are participating in the NDIS, for their families, for their carers and for the people who work with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a number of wonderful disability service providers in my electorate, and one of them recently invited me to visit. Araluen provide a range of disability services, but I went to meet with them and with two families who use their services for supported independent living. It was a heartbreaking meeting for me. This was just a couple of weeks ago. I had to sit in a room with families who were crying about the lack of support that was being offered to their children with disability under the NDIS. These parents are lying awake at night wondering what the future is for their children. This is the very thing the NDIS was put in place to end. The very thing a Labor government created the NDIS to do was to make sure that families and that people with disability know that they have a good future, to make sure they get the supports that are reasonable and necessary for a good life. That is not what is happening under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this meeting I met with a mother who is in her 70s. She has heart issues and an adult son with extremely complex support requirements. His behaviour means he causes significant injuries to himself and to staff. There is a need to ensure his safety in the community because he can display unpredictable and dangerous behaviour, particularly on or around roads, that could lead to significant injury to him or to others. Because of this behaviour, Araluen, the service provider, introduced 2:1 care for this young man during the day. That was not initially part of his NDIS plan but it was their assessment that that was what he needed to be able to be safe and for the people around him to be safe. They submitted multiple incident reports to the NDIA about the impacts of his behaviour when he did not have that 2:1 care in place. They asked for a review and for extra funding support. But, instead of getting that extra support, what happened was the NDIS came back to them and, in fact, cut the existing supported independent living funding in his plan. So rather than raising it, as was needed for his care, they actually cut his existing funding. Aspects of his budget were cut by just over $41,000. That is a really significant cut and it has had a significant impact on his life and on the life of his family. Araluen are still out of pocket providing him with this higher level of care, but the worry is that that now his NDIS package will be eaten up before it comes to the end of its lifespan and he will be left with no funding for supports. This is what his mother, in her 70s, is lying awake at night thinking about—that her son is going to run out of funding and have no funding for supports. This is a disgrace and it is on this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another mother I met with during this meeting was just about to take her very first holiday in years and years. She has an adult daughter with severe autism, extreme sensory impairment and self-injurious behaviours which are a significant risk to her health and safety and possibly to those she lives with. She lives in a group home run by Araluen. Unfortunately, in light of her behaviours, she was still struggling in this group home. Araluen put extra support around her, but her behaviours meant she felt quite territorial within her home environment, especially with the bathroom and toilet. She was acting aggressively towards other residents and staff. This was dangerous for the staff and it also meant that other residents were being traumatised and were feeling stressed. So, again, Araluen took it on themselves to try and fix this complex problem. They invested hours of extra support but found that did not work, so they moved this young woman to a house by herself. At that point, they saw an immediate change and de-escalation of the behaviours of concern, and the housemates, who had been feeling attacked and traumatised by her behaviour, also started to improve their behaviour.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In early June 2021, Araluen submitted on behalf of this young woman an urgent request of the NDIS for a change of circumstances and for a review of her supported independent living. Despite ongoing emails for a response, they did not get a planning meeting until November 2021. So after an urgent request in June 2021, they got a meeting in November 2021. They put all the evidence in front of the NDIS at that meeting. The planner agreed that it was an urgent and serious case and that it should be escalated and approved in two weeks. That was in November 2021. Not two weeks later but in January 2022, they heard back from the NDIS and, again, instead of extra support, what happened for this young woman was the funding she received was less than half of her previously approved support for independent living. So, again, not only did they not approve the increased funding that had been shown to be necessary for this woman's safety and for others around her but they approved less than half of her previous funding. Again, this leaves this family in an incredibly difficult position, where they don't know what their daughter's future is going to be. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is a life-changing scheme. It should be life-changing for all participants in the scheme, but under this government it is not operating as it should. Too many people are having their plans cut. Too many people are being caught up in meetings where they don't understand what's going on or where they don't understand what they are being asked for. Too many people tell me that they take evidence to the agency and it's not taken into account when they are having their plans built or reviewed. I have had a number of parents come to me and say their experience is that they find themselves halfway through a phone conversation with someone from the agency when they suddenly say, 'Hold on, is this a planning meeting?' They didn't even realise that was what was going on—that's how poor the communication coming out of the NDIS is at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I am hearing this every day from constituents in my community, when others on this side of the chamber and, I am sure, on the other side of the chamber are hearing this every day from constituents in their communities, it tells us that the NDIS is not working as it should, and that is on this Morrison government. This Morrison government has not supported the NDIS as it should, and it is not supporting people with disability to have the supports they should—reasonable and necessary supports that enable them to lead a life that is good and that enable them to be a part of our community. NDIS and the benefits it brings are good for all of us. They are good for all of us, our whole community, and this government just does not get that. Well, Labor gets it. We are the government that introduced the NDIS. Labor is the party that built the NDIS. We are the party that will fix the NDIS and we are the party that will always back the NDIS.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  I rise in support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Participant Service Guarantee and Other Measures) Bill 2021. One in five Australians live with a disability, and I remain committed to supporting the NDIS. I believe it is one of our most significant social policies in Australia today. This does not mean the NDIS is perfect; it is far from it. I will speak to those concerns I have later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The genesis of this bill before us was the 2019 review of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act commonly known as the Tune review. It recommended changes to the NDIS to remove red tape and improve the experience and outcomes of people living with disability interacting with the NDIS. I have heard from several of my constituents and peak bodies representing people living with disability regarding improvements to the bill. I thank JFA Purple Orange and People with Disability Australia for the engagement in particular. The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and other organisations identified that there was much to support in this bill, but crucial amendments were sought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am therefore pleased that the government's amendments to the bill now place limitations on the proposed powers of the CEO to vary a participant's plan in primary legislation and move section 14 rule-making powers regarding payments to individuals to category A rules, requiring consultation with states and territories. Concerns re impacts on the eligibility of people with psychosocial disability and other fluctuating, episodic conditions have also, I am informed, been resolved by amendments based on further consultation of peak bodies representing people with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must put on the record, though, that this has been a long and drawn-out process, and many people who have an NDIS package were deeply anxious that the original bill would have given extraordinary powers to the CEO, and that the CEO could and possibly would wholesale cut and change plans. I am also aware that the NDIS 2021-22 quarter 2 report shows that the average plan value per participant has dropped by four per cent between 2020 and 2021. Reportedly this means that 34 per cent of participants have seen cuts of more than five per cent of their budgets in the second half of last year. This is 10 per cent more participants who've experienced a cut of such significance during 2019-20.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've raised concerns with the government on behalf of my constituents regarding proposed independent assessments under the NDIS and was relieved that this was taken off the table. But it never should have been on the table in the first place. I think there's enormous fear in the community every time a piece of NDIS legislation comes into this place. That's because people are seeing salami cuts to their packages over and over again, and I was listening to the speeches of previous members regarding this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, I understand that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has confirmed that in the seven months between June 2021 and January 2022 this year it received 3,853 applications from participants seeking a review of decisions made by the NDIA. This compares with a far lower amount of 2,160 between June 2020 and June 2021 and, in the previous year, 1,780. So what we're seeing are more and more people with a disability needing to go to the AAT in relation to their NDIS plans because those plans have been substantially cut or do not fit the purpose. Figures provided by the AAT in response to questions raised in Senate estimates indicate that 17 hearings went before the AAT during the 2019-20 year, compared with 54 hearings in the 2020-21 year and growing to 59 in just a seven-month period to February this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's really important that we say very loudly to people with a disability that the NDIS will support them and that they don't have to go through the AAT, because we can't talk to the minister about it until their matter goes through the AAT. It is causing so much heartbreak, so much anxiety, particularly for families who have children with a disability, where we want to see their whole focus on supporting that child, not to have to go through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures that I mentioned I think raise a very clear picture of an increasingly adversarial system that is difficult for people to navigate. And then we're seeing a rapid increase in legal costs. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee at estimates indicated that legal costs in relation to applications to the AAT in the period from 1 July to 31 December 2021 totalled $19.1 million, which for that six-month period exceeded the entire $17.3 million in legal costs for the entire previous financial year. There is clearly an escalation of adversarial action here. And this rapid increase in legal costs does not account for the additional pressure and hardship that applying for and going through the process of challenging the NDIA decision at the AAT places on those at the centre of the NDIS—the people in our community who have a disability and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking about the NDIS, I must mention one of the NDIS's greatest failings, and that is that it is age discriminatory. This week I heard from Kelvin and Pauline. When cancer lesions damaged Kelvin's spinal cord, he became a paraplegic overnight, at age 67. Pauline says that while she finds caring for her husband Kelvin satisfying they are struggling physically and financially due to the inadequacy of care provided by his level 4 home-care package. That's because Kelvin is 67. If Kelvin was 64 and these lesions caused that disability he would have been able to access an NDIS package, but because he is 67 he cannot. What funds Kelvin has are quickly eroded by administration and management fees, even though they self-manage his aged care. It also took several years for them to find carers who understood the additional needs associated with paraplegia. Pauline and Kelvin say they have not received any respite care for three years, due to a lack of suitable services. What has happened to Kelvin and Pauline could happen to any one of us or our families. They should not be met with a brick wall because of their age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about disabilities that are not part of the natural process of ageing. Earlier this year I tabled a motion to call on the government either to remove the age discrimination against people aged 65 and more that is inherent within the NDIS legislation or to provide equivalent supports through home aged care. As Spinal Life Australia says, disability doesn't discriminate. We must fix this discrimination. It was one of the recommendations of the aged-care royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, the measures within this bill are a step towards putting people with disability at the centre of decision-making, along with their lives, going forward. I support this bill in the House. However, we must not lose sight of the policy purpose set out in the Tune review, which was to improve the experience and outcomes of Australians living with disability in the operation of the NDIS as a whole.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I'm pleased to make a contribution on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Participant Service Guarantee and Other Measures) Bill 2021. My home, the Hunter region, was a pilot region for the NDIS in 2013, introduced by the Gillard-Rudd Labor governments. I always welcome the opportunity to speak on the NDIS because, unfortunately, it is one of the main issues my constituents contact my office about when seeking assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements changes to the NDIS Act 2013 in response to the Tune review of the NDIS Act and NDIS participant service guarantee and the independent review of the act by Ernst &amp; Young in 2015. Other than the recommendations for the insidious independent assessments, which have caused such fear and anxiety for participants, Labor has been supportive of the Tune review's recommendations. Schedule 1 of the bill contains the participant service guarantee. This guarantee was an election commitment by the Morrison government to legislate time frames for NDIS decisions, which was also recommended by the Tune review. It's a damning indictment of this government and clearly demonstrates their attitude to the NDIS that they have not managed to legislate time frames for the NDIS decision in the last 2½ years. We are literally on the second-last day of the 46th Parliament and only now are the government getting around to legislating something they committed to at the 2019 election. What a disgraceful attitude. It is demonstrable of the contempt this government has for everyone who is participating in the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding schedule 1 of the bill, many in the disability community believe the proposed changes might create a back door for the government to achieve its original aim of independent assessments, which was to cut funding to participant programs. This was the government's intention, and, just because the minister has paused the assessments, given the government's track record it is not surprising they are trying in any way they can to make cuts to the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking on the participant service guarantee bill, it's relevant to share some of the experiences my constituents have had. I've been a member of this House for 8½ years, and one of the issues I'm most passionate about is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The member for Maribyrnong, the shadow minister, is entering the chamber, and I want to recognise again his contribution, with Jenny Macklin, to founding this great scheme. It is a scheme that has changed the lives of so many people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I was very proud that the Hunter was a pilot region for the scheme. In the early years it was very rare for me and my office to receive constituent inquiries on the NDIS. The system was generally working well in those early years. There are now certainly inquiries complaining about significant delays in getting responses from the agency and, of more concern, about participants and their carers getting no response to repeated general telephone inquiries. One mother I met in 2019 was so annoyed at receiving no return calls to her repeated inquiries that she travelled over half an hour to the NDIS office in Charlestown and literally spent hours and hours in the reception room refusing to leave until she actually got to speak to someone. This should not happen. Participants and their families and carers have complicated lives as it is, without having to deal with a complicated and inefficient bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another shocking example that came to my attention a few years ago was a planner trying to cut funding to a young boy's plan, saying, 'He has autism and the plan isn't working because he isn't getting better.' Let me repeat that: a planner tried to cut a young participant's plan because he wasn't recovering from autism. Anyone who has dealt with the challenges of autism, or knows someone who deals every day with autism, knows that you don't recover from it; you learn to live with it. Sadly, this is not an isolated case when I speak to disability advocates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example from a few years ago was a participant who was told that they could not access music therapy in their plan. This was despite there actually being a line item for music therapy. To make matters worse, the parliamentary liaison at the time told my office that the participant could not access music therapy. I had to obtain confirmation in writing from the minister that the participant could indeed access music therapy. This is a shocking example of a participant receiving appalling service from the agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most dramatic changes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme came when the government introduced independent assessments. Let there be no mistake: the Morrison-Joyce government have an agenda to continue to cut funding to the NDIS. There is no other explanation for these independent assessments than to cut funding to participants' plans. This is relevant to the participant service guarantee bill, because if plans are cut there needs to be a timely review process for participants. As an aside, I have never been contacted by a constituent who had an independent review and received extra support and funding after the assessment. They've only been constituents who have had their plans cut, in some cases dramatically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most shocking and cruel example I came across was a cut to another young boy who has a rare genetic disorder. His plan was cut from 35 hours of support a week to just three hours. This was a cut of $100,000, reducing this young boy's funding to a mere $8,000 a year. The horrific reason given by the planner was that now that the participant was at school this represented respite for his mother and he no longer needed the support. The first point here is that the boy's genetic condition required significant support for him when he was not at school. Secondly, his mother worked when he was at school, and work is not respite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the government this question: who is best placed to determine a participant's needs and support for their plans? Is it medical practitioners and experts who have an intimate knowledge of their condition, or some random assessor who spends a few hours with them and then makes decisions which can have horrific consequences for people living with a disability? I am not convinced the Liberals and Nationals won't try and bring back these disgusting independent assessments, and only an Albanese Labor government will ensure this does not happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, over the last few months there has been a significant increase in NDIS inquiries to my office. Let's not forget that those needing support from the NDIS are some of the most vulnerable people in our community. They deserve dignity and respect in their dealings with the agency and should not have to endure long waits because of an incompetent bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Liv Kalavasi is a constituent of mine. She is seven years old and has Williams syndrome. I previously met with her mother Gemma, a really lovely and articulate woman who is passionate about the NDIS and her family. Late last year, her plan was cut by 45 per cent, from $36,700 to $20,300. Gemma's summary of this process is very relevant. These are her words—the mother of a participant: 'There is a real disconnect between the coordinator dealing with the participant and the person making the decision.' Gemma is now having to go through the arduous process of an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal after an independent review upheld the original decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone else in similar circumstances is Ian Waller from Belmont South. I spoke about the savage cuts to Ian's plans earlier in this place. Ian is vision impaired and the NDIA have, incredibly, cut funding for his guide dog. There are no words to describe how despicable it is. They have cut funding so that Ian does not receive any funding for his guide dog. Ian is also going to have to appeal to the AAT. In the meantime, with help from his coordinator, he's relying on assistance from a GoFundMe campaign to keep his guide dog. I want to thank NBN News for their outstanding work drawing our community's attention to Ian's fight. The donations have been generous and are a great reflection of the decency of the people I represent. I want to recognise and thank everyone who has contributed to the GoFundMe campaign, and in particular, to thank Shane Spruce, the owner of PETQuarters, who is generously supporting Ian and his guide dog. But this should not be happening. The whole point of the NDIS is for participants to be provided with the support that they need to live in dignity and to fulfil their full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, as I've said many times, the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a contract from the Australian people to Australians living with a disability. It's a contract that says: 'No matter how your disability occurred, whether it was through birth or an accident, no matter whether you had insurance cover or not, we will assist you. We will make sure that you live a life full of dignity and respect and that we enable you to live to your full potential.' Unfortunately, under the nine long years of this Liberal-National government, the NDIS has not grown and developed as it was originally intended to, and people with a disability and their families and carers are bearing the consequences of the cruel conservative approach to government of the Morrison-Joyce government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister and Assistant Minister for Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Participant Service Guarantee and Other Measures) Bill 2021 demonstrates a commitment by this government to the focus on improving the experiences and outcomes of people with disability who engage with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This bill will legislate the Participant Service Guarantee as well as introduce additional measures to improve the NDIS processes and to improve flexibility to participants. The participant service guarantee means that the National Disability Insurance Agency must make decisions about a person's access to the scheme and their plans within a certain time frame. The guarantee also requires the NDIA to meet specific service standards when working with people with a disability and their families and carers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure the NDIA remains accountable to meeting the time frames and service standards in the participant service guarantee, the NDIA will need to report on how well it is delivering each part of the participant service guarantee. The Commonwealth Ombudsman will also be given powers to independently monitor and report to the government on how well the NDIA is improving the participant experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other measures will improve flexibility, provide greater clarity to those engaged with the NDIS, and the introduction of a plan variation will allow for quick changes to be made to a participant's plan without the need to undergo a full plan reassessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the changes are also about people with disability helping to design the NDIS and the role of carers and families supporting people with disability. The changes also use more inclusive language. The bill ensures that people with disability or lived experience of disability are represented on the NDIA board. This will strengthen the integrity of the NDIS by providing a robust mechanism for ensuring that the participants, their families and carers are more firmly at the centre of processes and decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes it clear that someone with an episodic or fluctuating disability may be eligible for the NDIS and clarifies how payments are made under the NDIS. Additional safeguards have been put in place for participants who want to use a registered plan management provider. The changes also remove provisions for the trial and transition phases of the scheme that are no longer required now the scheme is fully available across the whole of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the consultation conducted in relation to the draft bill, the bill has been scrutinised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, where sector representatives were able to make comments and speak to their concerns at the public hearings. I would like to thank everyone who provided input into the bill through the consultation and the work of the committees. The government has circulated amendments to the bill that respond to the feedback received. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

I do acknowledge the member for Fadden and his office for listening to our sensible suggestions on this bill and working constructively with Labor to improve it from a bill that was riddled with problems to a bill we believe the people of Australia will accept. In short, legislatively speaking, Labor was presented with a Ford Edsel—with a lemon. We've switched the engines, we've beaten the panels and we've touched up the duco. With our improvements, well, if it's not a Maserati then at least it's a stolid Toyota Corolla. This process of improvement by negotiation has been possible because there is, with one or two notable exceptions, a rare willingness to work together as we get towards the end of the 46th Parliament. This willingness to work together, I submit, has been rare since about September 2013, and that rarity is a shame. I think it is a shame that it takes the ending of this parliament and potential defeat at the ballot box for this nine-year-old government to perhaps get off their seats and get serious about negotiating in a bipartisan way and legislating for the common good. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not the only recent bill that's benefited from the all-too-rare spirit of goodwill. Why have so many cabinet ministers waited so long for these legislative changes—changes to social security rules, changes to disability services, changes that will help older Australians? These are not major improvements we need in these areas, mind you; they're only minor improvements. But, as minor changes, there will nonetheless be improvements for the lives and convenience of our fellow Australians. So Labor won't play politics; we will support them. The question is: why? Why, at the eleventh hour, do cabinet ministers decide they want a small iota of progress? Is it so they can put their name to something if they lose the election and leave this place—that they have some legacy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the government ministers are staring at the abyss of an uncertain election result. They're contemplating the long nights of the soul that will follow the days on the golf course of a post-parliamentary career. They're faced with the prospect of a long retirement and they're weighing their legacy. They're asking themselves: what was it all about and what did I actually achieve for ordinary Australians? At five minutes to midnight their chilly neoliberal hearts are thawing. Better late than never, but what a waste of governing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a broader question: why has the government been run so politically dogmatically for the last number of years? It's not been a great decade of conservative leadership in this country during these Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years, but the lack of centrism and the absence of bipartisan leadership has been particularly heightened under the current Prime Minister. People often comment about the Prime Minister's marketing background, but there is another part of his CV that explains a lot more about how, in the last few years, this country has endured being run for hourly political advantage. I speak, of course, of the Prime Minister's time as state director of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. There's a time for politicking—of course there is—but there's a time, such as in a pandemic or a national emergency, to rise above and lead for the common good. Instead, we have the former party director's eye there, always, like the Eye of Sauron, hovering above the cabinet table, above the coalition, above the premiers—Liberal and Labor—above the national cabinet table, scrutinising the best possible advantage not for the nation but for the office holder himself. I do think that much more could have been advanced for Australia with a bipartisan spirit from the government. Alas, we can't turn back the clock on the last three years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some members of this government who I think consider themselves quite adept techno-futurists—call them the Zuckerbergs of the Public Service. They look to Silicon Valley and they think, 'Why can't the Australian government be more like that?' with perhaps the particular minister boldly at the helm. They look at our information technology changes and they see no risk, only opportunity. This does a strange thing to traditional politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conservatives often accuse parties of the Left and social democratic parties like Labor of wrongly thinking that the state can intervene and help in aspects of society. Parties of labour get accused of being naive about the competence and abilities of the state. At the most extreme, there are proclamations like that of the Treasurer's hero, Margaret Thatcher, that not only is the market better placed than the state to adjudicate most problems but there's no such thing, even, as society. American Barstool conservative, the late PJ O'Rourke, put it a different way when he said, 'Giving extra power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when it comes to rapid IT advances and the changing of the rules that protect citizens, we find ourselves on our side of the aisle having to say to the more conservative side: 'Calm down, folks. Things can go wrong. The state doesn't always necessarily get these things right.' A perfect example of this in the previous term was robodebt. We should all be state-tech sceptics after robodebt. It's hard to believe in a government technological utopia after the technological dystopia that was robodebt. Let's call robodebt what it was: a cruel and illegal war on the poor, powered by an unhinged automated algorithm in which human oversight was completely removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the Eden-Monaro by-election, Labor announced our policy that, should we win government, we'll have a royal commission into how robodebt came to be so that these mistakes can never be repeated. Even after robodebt, Labor has been required to be the sensible interlocutor on behalf of the Australian people. And with this bill it is Labor—and I acknowledge my own office and the office of the shadow Attorney-General—who have interceded to remove its most dangerous tendencies and have introduced several much-needed legislative safety rails.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Data Availability and Transparency Bill that was introduced to parliament in December 2020 was in Labor's view then deeply flawed. We did not have a problem with the underlying purpose of the bill, to the extent that it was aimed at establishing a scheme for controlled access to public sector data for three limited purposes: delivery of government services; informing government policies and programs; and research and development. But the bill they proposed then was poorly designed, with all the bad trappings of something that had been through a rushed design process. The flaws were so many that I'll canvass only the major atrocities now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the privacy protections were insufficient for data which ultimately is the Australian people's data, not the government's. The government is only a custodian of this information. Second, there were a lack of safeguards were this new system of data sharing to go wrong once it was put in place. Our third major problem was that the scope of the data-sharing scheme was excessively broad, proposing opening public data to foreign, non-Australian organisations. Fourth, it was also excessive and highly problematic that such an untested new scheme was proposed to involve private corporations that would be able to apply for access to public data under the bill. And, fifth, the penalties for breaches of the scheme were insufficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These weren't all the problems; these were the major problems. So, as it was first proposed, the bill was a mess. It was riddled with conflicts and was too broad ranging, with insufficient safeguards. We were asked by the government who brought us the robodebt fiasco to rubberstamp a system that would potentially expose the data of Australian citizens to foreign corporations. Labor was unwilling to unleash such a dangerous scheme upon the Australian public. We refused to support it in the flawed form. So, for the good of the Australian people, the flawed bill went nowhere. Labor demanded a Senate inquiry, which threw the flaws of the proposed legislation and scheme into further stark relief. I want to thank Senator Tim Ayres, the late Senator Kimberley Kitching and Senator Marielle Smith for their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has spent more than a year consulting with stakeholders and with the government. To some extent the government has outsourced the job of consulting to the opposition. Anyway, it was not just we in Labor who had concerns about the original design; it was privacy groups, the Law Council and the Australian Medical Association, among others. We were busy behind the scenes throughout 2021 trying to salvage a workable data-sharing scheme that also protects the interests of the public. I do want to thank the government and the member for Fadden's office for negotiating in good faith. Whether or not they did it out of pure political pragmatism, it's an okay result for the Australian public nonetheless. The initial risks of the scheme, the privacy concerns and misuse of data, have been mitigated by the concessions the government has given Labor during negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the most troubling aspects of the original bill have now been mitigated. The major improvements include that the lack of privacy protections and safeguards have been overcome, that the scope of the scheme extending for foreign organisations has been removed, that the scope of the scheme extending for the private sector has been removed, that a review of how the scheme is running is to be conducted in three years and that there is a five-year sunset clause in the whole thing. Other improvements include the clear removal of compliance as a legitimate purpose under the scheme, the removal of conflicts in the role of the data commissioner, greater public transparency of the data sharing projects being approved, increased sanctions for the breaches of the rules and an increased onus on the requirement to seek consent from data holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its new form, the bill now essentially removes some of the barriers to data sharing between state and federal governments and Australian universities for specified purposes and with the approval of the data commissioner. It is now a scheme for data sharing with oversight and for specified purposes and it applies not to foreign entities or the private sector but to Australian governments, their departments and agencies, and the Australian university and research sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is possible under this safer version of the scheme? Well, in the wake of a disaster such as a bushfire or a flood, where the government is trying to get emergency payments to people without documentation, a ruling by the data commissioner could, for instance, enable Centrelink offices to make an emergency disaster payment to a needy family that are not Centrelink clients, into their Medicare-linked bank account. At the moment such a thing is impossible due to rule constraints. That is the scope of the data-sharing scheme in our government and universities. With this vast reduction in scope, many of Labor's concerns and the concerns of stakeholders are soothed. The AMA, for instance, was concerned that private health insurers might be able to get their hands on identifiable health data. With the removal of the private sector, that primary concern is addressed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has worked constructively and diligently. We've communicated our own concerns and the concerns of experts to the government. The result of these painstaking negotiations is a much more acceptable scheme. Our attitude was this: prove to the Australian public that this can work in the public sector before asking them to trust that the doors should be flung open to private multinational corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now wish to elaborate on why it's so important that leaders in government take a sensible approach to opening up public datasets to private multinational corporations, as was initially proposed before Labor's intervention. But let me say this: this is not an anti-business approach; it's an approach that is pro the rights of the individual. There are many excellent companies. The vast, vast, vast majority here and abroad do business every day in a highly ethical way. But, when corporations choose to betray the public trust, things can go wrong very quickly. We would be foolish to ignore lessons from such incidents.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who remember the dawn of the internet have witnessed how the true nature of digital tech companies and what they do with users' data has become clearer over time. Free search engines, like Google, once seemed like wonderful free services that were just part of the furniture of the internet. Free online meeting places, like Facebook, seemed the same. But, in 2022, the nature of these businesses is more starkly apparent. There are big companies that must find a way, any way, to drive profit. These are not benevolent charities. The commercial drive has intensified since companies have been floated and they have had the pressure of stakeholders. Those carefree early internet days of using search engines and social media while believing it was there to serve you now seem perhaps naive in retrospect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The headlines and consequent stock market results that Facebook and Zuckerberg attract today are very different to those of nine years ago. We are aware now of how users' data can be harvested and manipulated and sold to third parties. There is a saying about the digital world: if you don't pay for the product, you are the product. Certainly companies like Facebook and Google make money from advertising, just as traditional media did for many golds. But the real corporate value for some of these companies, the real rivers of gold, are in the targeted, personalised advertising market and the data harvesting of their users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data, it is said, has now surpassed oil as the world's most valuable resource. In some ways, the tech titans of the 21st century are strikingly similar to the oil barons of the early 20th century: then, Rockefeller and Getty; now, Bezos and Zuckerberg—super powerful, quasi-monopolistic, utterly committed to their own interests. Like the oil barons, the tech titans pose a challenge to competition watchdogs and how they operate in a legal landscape that struggles to keep pace with their breakneck development. But the commodity in today's masters of industry trade is far more personal than oil; it's the private data of individuals. Some tech companies have never been very upfront about this shadier back end of their business.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, thanks to journalists, activists and documentaries like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Social Dilemma </span>and<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Hack,</span> people know a bit more than they used to. But we should not be in any doubt; the highly sophisticated commodification of personal data is very new and challenging territory. Amongst other things, it creates a knowledge-and-power divide, a divide where the powerful have access to data and can exploit and manipulate the powerless, whose data they possess and control. Societies around the world are in the experimental phase of seeing what happens when the private sector is able to commodify very personal data. It is not just data around age and location that is being commodified. Your internet clicks and choices portray your outlook on many things. Your very outlook is being parcelled up and sold on. Private aspects of people's likes and dislikes, hopes and fears—their very personalities—are being measured and commodified. It's the sort of power and access to personal information which was beyond the imagination of the great George Orwell of the 20th century. It's been a seismic change in society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the change, arguably, has been consensual. Generation Z would have a very different and much more relaxed notion of privacy and surveillance than the baby boomers. But a lot of it, perhaps, has crept up on people from the tech companies who've harvested the data of unaware targets. They've taken advantage of legislators and competition watchdogs lagging behind the speed of technological advancement, and, where laws have existed, sometimes they have simply scoffed at the prospect of them being able to be enforced against them. Sometimes we are like the fish at a trout farm, marvelling at all the free worms that we are being fed. But, eventually, a worm catcher contains a hook, and the fisher exerts their original purpose and reels in their catch.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The secret harvesting of personal data, to some extent, has been a passive activity. The burghers of Silicon Valley have been like observers who sit behind a one-way mirror. The real manipulation begins when, not knowing a lot about you, they start pulling your strings. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is a notorious example of this. It saw Facebook allow a third-party app to take up the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook profiles and build a psychological profile of them, which British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica then used in a political campaign. The revelation of the scandal led to a fine for Facebook, led to Cambridge Analytica filing for bankruptcy, yet more statements by Mr Zuckerberg of regret and yet more pledges to do better. If you think this is just a version of politics as usual, it is worth considering the description by the Cambridge Analytica CEO of the hidden interference on behalf of one of the parties in the Trinidad election. He was recorded saying:</span>

This time, Facebook turned 700,000 of its users into psychological laboratory rats to be poked and prodded without their awareness. While Facebook customers read their feeds and looked at photos of family and friends, cat videos and news headlines, technology big brother was there testing what would happen if their mindsets were messed with. Without warning, Facebook used data scientists to skew what hundreds of thousands of Facebook users saw when they logged onto the social media site. One group was given a feed featuring happy and positive content. The other was given feeds that skewed negative and featured sad content. At the end of the week-long involuntary experiment, emotional contagion was proven. The negative feed consumers went on to post negative words and content themselves and the positive consumers posted more positive content. It was the moment we moved from a world where the customer is always right to one where the customer is unwittingly subjected to a psychological vivisection. It does not take a huge leap of imagination to see big technology combining these manipulative techniques for advertising and commercial purposes.</span>

How have we got to this point in the world, where so many in the world can be manipulated like marionettes? In some ways, we are the victims of our own success in the advancement of data technologies and, to some extent, our own oversharing and failure to protect our own privacy online. Facebook falls back on the fine print of its terms and conditions to justify these psychological operations, but I don't really think it passes the lounge room test, the kitchen test, the pub test or what have you. Experts are unconvinced by Facebook's argument there is any real consent on the part of its users. This is by no means a comprehensive timeline of the global digital experience and, of course, so much about our digital revolution has empowered and has delivered massive and fantastic change and improvement to the quality of peoples lives. But the examples I have used come from companies such as Facebook, now calling itself Meta, that originated in the US.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are even greater threats and complications from platforms like TikTok, which is run by ByteDance out of China. These examples are representative of some of the ways our perception of the free internet is changing and we are becoming more aware and less naive. Digital consumers are, thankfully, increasingly aware of how their information is being commodified. They are increasingly aware that tech companies may promote corporate mottos like 'Don't be evil and do the right thing', but they don't always practice what they preach.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ideally, governments around the world should have been ahead of these unsavoury developments. Ideally, we would have been pre-emptively, through regulation and negotiation, protecting citizens from the excesses of large profit-driven corporations. The world is starting to get there now, a little late perhaps, not helped by the blind faith that conservative neoliberal governments around the world have in the so-called invisible guiding hand of the market, but we are starting to get there.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on this potted version of the data story so far and where it can go wrong, there are a few lessons we can learn. Data, unlike gold or oil, may seem intangible but it is a precious, sought-after commodity. We know that the lust for precious stones led to the blood diamond industry. We know that shortages of sand needed for building is leading to criminal gang activity and mass environmental destruction. We need to change our mindset and recognise the same incentives and profit motives apply to the precious commodity of data. Firstly, people's data may not be being harvested and exploited at the point of a gun, but it is still being harvested, manipulated and exploited. Secondly, legislators need to ensure they are keeping up with the ability of corporations to breach people's inherent rights to privacy, dignity and being free from manipulation. Thirdly, we should be reticent in trusting an unchecked private sector to handle people's data with an automatically guaranteed sense of ethics. Fourthly, we can trust governments much more than we can trust private corporations. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians may feel pretty cynical about their governments at the moment. I certainly don't blame them feeling that way about the current federal government. But at least they have the power and the ability to vote them out. We can't vote out Mark Zuckerberg. We need to ensure the government is being a competent gatekeeper, vigilantly protecting citizens' data rights against corporate raiders. The balance good governments must strike is between not being backward about harnessing the power of technological advances and not being naive about the need for effective oversight of the private sector's involvement in government services, which brings us back to our Data Availability and Transparency Bill. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is in favour of modernising our Public Service, particularly when doing so can result in a better experience for individual Australians trying to access government services. Labor is in favour of using big data to make sure we can gain the benefits which are available in the provision of information by citizens to their government. But our modernising, progressive impetus must be balanced by the rights of individual Australians in their dealings with government. When it comes to public data, it must always be remembered this is people's data. It is not a thing owned by the government that can or should be commodified or sold to the highest bidder. The government is merely the custodian. We are merely the custodians of our citizens' information on trust. I think, sometimes, some government ministers are tech utopians who think the government should race to emulate the corporate world. But a Silicon Valley motto of 'move fast and break things', if ever appropriate, is particularly inappropriate in the context of obligations a government has to its citizens about their personal information. When tech utopians are given unbridled access to levers of government we can get disasters like robodebt and white elephants like the COVIDSafe app. </span>

It will be constantly up to the government of the day to ensure in practice this scheme is run correctly, that an appropriate person occupies the position of data commissioner and that there are not unwanted, unforeseen consequences. A phrase that was popularised after the American Revolution comes to mind: 'Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.' Another relevant phrase is: 'You cannot legislate against stupidity.' It will be up to the government of the day to monitor the new scheme and ensure that in practice there are not abuses and breaches that go unpunished, but, most of all, that we uphold and continue to honour the public interest. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  It may surprise the member for Maribyrnong to know that I probably agree with nearly 90 per cent of what he said there. We are in this brave new world where big data poses a grave threat to individual rights and privacy, and big data collected by government that is enjoined with big business is probably the scariest situation that I can imagine arising for privacy and for our freedoms. The one thing that I didn't agree with the member for Maribyrnong on was the words that this work had achieved the right balance. Sure, I acknowledge that there has been a lot of discussion between the government and the opposition on this bill which has taken out of the original bill a lot of the problematic areas. There have been Senate inquiries that have looked into this bill that have taken out a lot of the problematic areas of the bill. But being better doesn't necessarily make it good. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a litmus test that we should have in this place when a bill comes before us. Did any of your constituents ever email you about government sharing data with different departments or sharing data with state governments or sharing de-identified data with universities? Did anyone ever walk into your office and ask you, as an MP, to vote for this bill or say that there was a problem they saw that necessitated this proposed act? Did anyone ever stop you in the street? Did anyone ever phone you or one of your staff members about it? I'd say by and large the answer for every single person who inhabits this chamber would be no on this front.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why are we doing it? Where does it come from? I've heard from the government and now the opposition the argument that, if there's a natural disaster, an extreme event, we can easily get payments to people. If they don't have the data that they need to present to get that payment, we can look at Medicare or we can look at something else and get their data for that purpose. But there's an old saying that hard cases make bad law. That is an extreme situation. Sure, it happens from time to time, but it's still an extreme situation. I don't know that we need to up-end our privacy provisions in this country for that extreme situation. I actually haven't heard another argument beyond that for this bill. I have not heard one. If one exists, I'd love to know. What I would really love to know is an argument that exists for this bill that is actually for the benefit of the people rather than the benefit of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, as I said before, a lot of the problematic areas from how it was drafted originally have been knocked out of this bill through the process that it's gone through, but here are some questions. Apparently the data that's going to go to external organisations, which would be universities for research purposes, is going to be de-identified. How is it going to be de-identified? Can it be re-identified? Is there the potential for that? I don't know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm told the data that's going to go inter governmental, whether it's between Commonwealth government departments or the Commonwealth and states, is only going to be for the benefit of individuals and that that data sharing cannot be used for anything that is investigative or punitive or for any other negative measure against a citizen. But what happens if it is? Sure, there might be a smack on the wrist for someone, but what happens if it is? What happens if it is used in that fashion? Is the Commonwealth going to suddenly drop all proceedings against someone because the data was used in a way that it shouldn't have been? I don't know. I hope that the answer would be that, yes, all proceedings against that individual would be dropped. But the fact is that we've got data sharing, so it could potentially happen. I'm very worried about this bill and the trajectory that we're going down. This bill now has bipartisan support. It doesn't have my support. It might have bipartisan support, but it does not have my support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear that what's behind this is the digital identity push. I've got to tell my colleagues on all sides of this House: do not ever do that. Do not ever accept a national digital identity system in this nation. That will be the end, not the beginning, of privacy in this country. It will be the beginning of big government intruding into our lives far too much. I'm afraid that this legislation, having originally been crafted for the purpose of sharing data with private corporations, is also the beginning of something else. We can have all the protections in this bill right now, but 10 years down the track what's going to happen to those protections? Where is this going to lead? Are we going to have data sharing between big government and big corporations? I don't want to be part of that, and that's why I'm stating right now on the record that I do not support this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  In rising to speak on the Data Availability and Transparency Bill 2020, I wanted to start from a different viewpoint, and that is to reflect on a few events that have occurred in the past 12 months, and it's in a way that you wouldn't necessarily assume would be attached to this bill. In the past 12 months, for the first time, artificial intelligence beat some of the best game players in the world at a video game called Gran Turismo—sport. The first time they attempted this was in July, and the human players won easily. But by October the tables had been turned and increasingly the human players found it very difficult to beat the AI. They noticed more and more that the artificial intelligence found ways to play that people hadn't thought about. This is not the first time this has happened. In fact, AI is starting to challenge the way we as humans approach problems and is starting to challenge the whole notion of reason and logic, the way we apply them, the way we get to answers and the way we find solutions. It's not the first time it's happened in games.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was also interesting that when AI was used to consider the development of new antibiotics it also came up with antibiotics that had been discovered in a way that most human researchers wouldn't have necessarily thought would be the way that you would develop that antibiotic and, in addition, simply crunched through the data, way quicker than any humans would have been able to do. That's where artificial intelligence is at, at the moment. But it is not only about the way people think about its ability to crunch data, particularly large datasets. But the way it's doing it, and the solutions it's coming up with—it's doing it in a way that we didn't think about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of things that come out of that, most notably—and I will come to this later—the framework we put around the operation of AI. In the case of the antibiotics, there was a specific requirement that whatever the AI came up with could not be toxic for humans. So frameworks are important. As AI starts to develop, it will increasingly be used—and it is being used. Everyone thinks it's a new development. It's taken about 50 years or so to get to this point. And computing power, neural networks—all the developments that have occurred in the past 10 to 15 years—have meant that AI is getting better and better and better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasingly, governments are going to find that they will rely on artificial intelligence more and more. As Henry Kissinger points out—and over the break I read his book which he wrote with Eric Schmidt, formerly of Google—as AI gets better, governments increasingly, when they decide to make decisions outside of an AI framework, will be asked—parliamentarians will find themselves being asked—'Why did you use AI instead of humans to make those decisions?' That likely is a scenario, plausibly, that will occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about AI is that to get better and better and better it needs this thing called data. It needs to be able to possess that in increasing volumes and to be able to crunch it on a continual basis and to be able to apply it in particular ways. So, for us as parliamentarians, it is really important that we engage in this debate and think through not just to the darkest edges of the debate, which the mind will tend to wander to—and I understand that that's the way we will get to that point. But the fact of the matter is that if we don't use this and we decide to shut our minds to the notion of the use of AI and the availability of data to make that happen, then, sure, we can do that, but other countries will be using it, and other countries will apply it in ways to make their economies work better, to make their governments work smarter and to make their communities operate better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is going to be an important consideration for us—whether or not we do that now or leave it for others to do, while we get left behind. I don't think most Australians would want that. In a country where we have regularly been pointed out as being fast adopters of technology, I think in the broader public mind they get that technology does make our lives easier and that they want to use it in ways that improve quality of life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I tell you what, it's taken a hell of a long time to get to this bill to look at the frameworks around how that data is used and shared. The Productivity Commission in 2016 brought down its report that talked about how we use data. There's a whole movement around open data and gov data. There have been a lot of people, like Pia Waugh, who've been here in times past when gov hacks have occurred. The movement aims to get access to data and to think about how to do things differently and improve the quality of living, not to just be attracted to the darker edges of this debate but to actually think about, with the data that has been collected, how we can apply it in a way that makes people's lives better. That movement has existed here for quite some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission tried to think, 'How would we use data, and what frameworks could we put in place?' This came out ages ago. The first act that we got out of the coalition was not to think about the open data requirements and the way in which government could use this much more beneficially; their first thought was to come up with a consumer data right, to make a buck out of it, and provide a framework for banking that could take data that was currently being used in finance to then be used in that respect. I don't have a problem with that, but it's interesting that that was the priority of this government. I'll come to the CDR thing in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That happened in 2016. The first thing they did was CDR. The coalition promised before the last election that they would have this framework in place. We then got this bill in December 2020. And then the only point at which this gets debated is now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the member for Maribyrnong because he has applied deep thought to this. He has worked constructively, he has consulted and he has secured improvements to this bill. But if we pass this today, which I imagine we will, all that effort that the member for Maribyrnong undertook will go to waste because this government has failed to get this bill debated in this House and then considered by the Senate. Guess what? The Senate, tomorrow, has estimates. It's out. So, by the time this bill gets considered, it is highly unlikely it will pass. It will be two terms since we've had some sort of framework in place to manage this, which is just crazy, because this is stuff we do need to do. We do need to think, as the member for Maribyrnong has been pointing out, about those ethical considerations about how data's used. As much as we need to ensure that that data's available, that it is crunched through AI and that it is applied in beneficial ways, we do need to—as he has rightly pointed out—not think in a completely utopic way but just get the balance right. I think the best thing in this debate is not to be completely in a utopian frame of mind or a dystopian frame of mind but to just get the balance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ellen Broad, in a really good book—and I encourage people to read this book—<span style="font-style:italic;">Made by Humans</span>, makes the point that AI is not some magical thing that just applies on its own. It is shaped by people, and the decisions on its application are shaped by people. She also points out government's tendency. You can't always assume that government will use technology in a way that is always beneficial, because more often than not it will use technology in a way that sometimes runs counter to people's interests. We should always bear that in mind as well. That's why I think the member for Maribyrnong's interventions are important to inject that type of thinking. We do need to make sure that we don't have other robodebts, but we also need to make sure that, if we can speed up decision-making in automated ways and we've got the frameworks right, we do so and we have that data available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the people who suggest that this bill will open up all sorts of terrible consequences in the way that things will be used—I haven't heard a lot of those voices. I have spoken in times past about, for example, the way in which we set up the metadata framework many years ago and the way that was pushed through. I have been on this case about the way that data has been used, accessed or applied for quite some time. So it is interesting to see. We heard from one of the speakers just a few moments ago, who I don't think ever spoke up before. Maybe I'm wrong; I'm happy to stand corrected. They never spoke up on the way that metadata was used or the countless pieces of national security legislation that come through and access citizens' data all the time. I never heard those protections being championed by those opposite at all. Let's not forget the irony of some of those on the far Right who rail against data and the way it's being used while they mine data themselves for the sake of building their own political careers, movements or whatever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to the point that this government talks a big game on data, talks a big game on digital. I note the AIIA had recommended that the government set up AI ethics boards to create the guidelines and best practice for the use of artificial intelligence in government, to create ethical guidelines for the development and use of AI, to ensure that members across the APS and members from industry are involved in that setting up of standards and practice, and that an AI register of all current and future solutions that use AI or machine learning be established to allow for citizen transparency. These are all good things. The industry is thinking about it; the government is slow to act on it. I commend the AIIA for putting that stuff on the public record to get governments to think about the use of data because it will be important longer term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the government, it is always a shiny new bauble when it comes to them. It is the latest thing that they might get a great media headline out of and make themselves look like they are future-leaning but they never seem to deliver. It seems to be a common thread with this government, with the coalition to be always there for the announcement but never there for the delivery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I referenced earlier the Consumer Data Right. I have had a number of complaints from industry about the way the Consumer Data Right has been set up for finance—bear in mind it will go across to energy and telecoms at some point—and about the mismanagement of this process. I had one person in particular point out that the Consumer Data Right is progressing at lightning speed after a number of years of instability and iterative development. A person said to me that there is a sense amongst the market that the first sector has not been finished and now attention and resources have been redeployed to other areas. They emphasised banking is not finished yet. There has been no straight-through consent mechanism, no consumer dashboard, no monitoring of the health of the API ecosystem. The role of intermediaries, an afterthought, has not been tested or finalised. There is no unique identifier between different sectors to allow for cross-sectoral data sharing—that is, banking has a customer ID while energy has a premises identifier. There is literally no way for one sector to register an amendment of withdrawal of consent with another sector, which is a big issue, a massive issue. That is about making sure that consent is allowed and, when it is not, how things are managed post that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The refusal to consider business data and personal data differently from a risk standing means 2.4 million SMEs will have their operations disrupted through zero MYOB and be no longer able to share data with apps that exist on their marketplaces. This point, which I think is relevant to this debate, is that the Data Availability and Transparency Bill and the CDR are literally incompatible in their current formats. There is no conceivable way that public datasets can mingle with CDR data, which, to this person's view, is a tragedy due to the potential for used cases and global best practice. These rules are being developed as a priority over standards, which is backwards. The most damning thing is that, weirdly, the Treasury is leading this, not the technical people nor the ministerial office—lots of duck shoving going on! What a surprise!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side suggested in the last term that those opposite be careful and think this stuff through. We wanted to have the Senate involved through that whole process as the house of review, but we had the Treasurer working with Senator Jane Hume to shut down any work on this and shut down the thinking around it. We need data availability to make sure that it is applied in a way that will work for the people. We need to ensure there is confidence in the way that occurs. What we don't need is a situation where the government is only out there for the sake of the headline, only there for the sake of the announcement, trying to gather a great photo opportunity and then not following through. If CDR is any example or sends us any signal about how this will operate under a coalition then we should be very concerned. It is important to get the frameworks right, as has been attempted by this bill. I wonder whether or not it will get through. But getting the final landing, making sure this works, is even more important because, if we lose the confidence of people, we will ensure that we can't get our act together at a broader level.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  Fifty-five years ago, in 1967, Edward Gough Whitlam gave the budget reply speech. In that speech he said, 'One of the problems in discussing health policy in Australia is the lack of reliable official information.' Fifty-five years on, not as much has changed as we might have liked. As my co-author Philip Clarke, the director of the Health Economics Research Centre at Nuffield's Department of Population Health at Oxford University, notes, 'There is still great potential to learn more from using administrative data on improving health efficiency.' In Philip's paper—co-authored with Xinyang Hua, Guido Erreygers, John Chalmers and Tracey-Lea Laba, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Health Policy</span>—when they used linked Medicare data, in the first year of life Medicare spending was actually regressive. Their paper notes that analysis of out-of-pocket expenditure could be much more detailed if there was better access to linked administrative data and suggests a number of important ways forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the use of health data by researchers has been plagued by the incompetence of this government when it comes to releasing those data. An article in the University of Melbourne's magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Pursuit</span> in 2017, by Vanessa Teague, Chris Culnane and Ben Rubinstein, is titled 'The simple process of re-identifying patients in public health records'. It notes that in September 2016 the government put out an MBS/PBS sample dataset and the researchers found that the encryption of supplier IDs was easily reversed. They informed the department and the dataset was taken offline. Then in December 2016 the same researchers found that patients could be re-identified by using known information about the person to find their record. The researchers found unique records matching three current or former members of parliament and a number of other prominent Australians. They informed the department in December 2016 and, again, the dataset was taken down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, rather than acknowledge the honesty of the cryptographers who made clear to the department the flaws in the encryption methodology, this government set about attacking those researchers—attacking the very researchers who'd noted the flaws in what the government put online. The then Attorney-General, George Brandis, announced plans to criminalise the act of re-identifying previously de-identified data, as though somehow it was alright for the government to put out a dataset in which individuals could be re-identified; they'd just make it a crime to do so. Fortunately, that legislation didn't pass, but the ongoing attacks on Vanessa Teague ultimately led to her having to quit the University of Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is great potential to be had from the careful use of big data. But we on this side of the House recognise the importance of maintaining strict privacy protections. Thanks to the work of the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, a number of troubling aspects of this bill have been removed or overcome, including overcoming the lack of privacy protections and safeguards, removing the scope of the scheme to extend to foreign organisations, removing the scope of the scheme to extend to the private sector, and introducing a three-year review and a five-year sunset clause. That reflects the strong views of those of us on this side of the House that big data can make a difference in improving people's lives but that it must be done with care and appropriate scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That, of course, was the big flaw in the robodebt scandal, which had its genesis in the belief by those opposite that it was possible to simply use big-data analytics to chase down welfare recipients who'd allegedly done the wrong thing. Robodebt was not the first time big-data analytics had been used to detect fraud. What made it different was removing the human element from the system. As Cathy O'Neil's terrific book <span style="font-style:italic;">Wea</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pons of Ma</span><span style="font-style:italic;">th</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Destruction</span> has made clear, algorithms can be dangerous. They can replicate existing biases in court sentencing processes. Algorithms, if misused in the assessment of teachers, can produce results which are more strongly driven by noise than by signal. Indeed, the recent book by Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein, <span style="font-style:italic;">Noise</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: A Flaw in Human Judgment</span>, has made clear that we need to be very careful about the use of big data in a way that allows noise to dominate signal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, in public policy, too many examples of algorithms and big data being misused. And, yet, when they're used right, they can be incredibly helpful. Georgia State University is currently using predictive analytics to spot students in danger of dropping out, looking at not just their overall GPA but their scores in particular classes. They have increased their four-year graduation rate as a result. We have seen careful work being done by Raj Chetty and his co-authors, including Nathaniel Hendren and John Friedman, in using big-data analytics to look at mobility across the United States—for example, noting that your chances of going from the bottom fifth to the top fifth of the income distribution are three times greater in San Jose, California than they are if you grow up in Charlotte, North Carolina. A similar analysis by Sarah Merchant using tax records covering almost the entire US population from 1989 to 2015 has discovered that the income gap between blacks and whites persists for generations, is driven entirely by differences in wages and employment between black and white men rather than women, and is smaller for black boys who grow up in neighbourhoods with lower poverty rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In New Zealand, the Integrated Data Infrastructure has found that the probability of moving from low pay to high pay is not as high when the analysis is done using detailed monthly income records as when it is carried out using patchy surveys. New Zealand has also used its Integrated Data Infrastructure to analyse the potential spread of COVID and to identify those areas that are most at risk. So we do need to make sure, as Martin Kurzweil has pointed out, that 'algorithm is not destiny'; it's important that human judgement is never removed from the process. But, if we do that and we're careful about our use of big data, there is great potential for government to partner with academic institutions in order to improve lives for all Australians and to better fulfil that goal that Gough Whitlam laid out in his budget reply speech of 1967.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MUL</span>
                    </a>
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">INO</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  This bill, the Data Availability and Transparency Bill, is designed to facilitate controlled access to public sector data for specific purposes in the public interest through a legislative framework. That's a rather anodyne statement and potentially one that many would find unobjectionable, but it's also one with potentially significant implications, both positive and negative, for people's everyday lives. And that's why this bill is important and that's why, more importantly, it's so important that this government and future governments move in a sensible direction when it comes to government's use of data. This is part of this government's belated response to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into data availability and use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As earlier speakers on this side have alluded to, there is a significant potential upside if governments can better use data. There are many examples, which I won't run through exhaustively, but one example is new services— services qualitatively different to ones that we're currently seeing. An obvious example of that is on-demand buses, which can make a real difference in people's lives, particularly in regional and outer suburban areas. Another one is individualised services, which can make a huge difference in the efficiency and effectiveness of services like health care and other areas of service delivery, such as aged care and the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is the more accurate and efficient use of scarce government resources, particularly—and this is something explicitly alluded to in this bill—after natural resources. I want to refer very briefly to something that I worked on a long time ago, when I was a state MP, which was a series of auctions of bus routes for a school for children with autism. The use of data in relation to their travel preferences and the optimisation of routes led to a reduction by more than 50 per cent in travel time, plus the removal of any need for children to change buses, which had been extremely stressful. That required the use of some data in relation to when people wanted to travel, but it was done in such a way that all of that data was protected, and it led to a significant improvement in outcomes. So I am not a complete utopian, but I definitely see the potential for a significant upside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do want to talk explicitly about some of the potential downsides, and all of the previous speakers on this side have referred to them. The member for Maribyrnong went through quite a number of them. The use of algorithms is particularly dangerous. It can lead, quite often, to perverse, unexpected and unintended outcomes. One example is the fracturing of people's access to media and information—for example, on social media platforms. Another one is algorithms that just get wrong outcomes, and robodebt is a good example of that, although it's a very, very tragic one in terms of its real-life impacts. Another obvious risk is to privacy, which a number of speakers have alluded to. That is clearly something which governments will have to be vigilant about in the future. Another risk is outright manipulation, and, again, other speakers have alluded to this. Facebook is an example of where certain political campaigns, or other people or entities trying to change people's views in a range of ways, have manipulated people in ways that are often quite dangerous. So there are clearly pros and cons. The member for Maribyrnong outlined a number of them, and the member for Chifley spoke about the fact that we need to achieve a balance in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a step forward. It is clearly a belated one, given how long ago it was that the Productivity Commission handed down its report and, as earlier speakers have indicated, given the low likelihood of it even passing. Some troubling aspects of the original bill have been removed, such as the lack of privacy protections and safeguards. The scope of the scheme extending to foreign organisations has been removed, and the scope of the scheme extending to the private sector has been removed. So this bill is a far better bill than was originally proposed, but there is clearly so much more to do. I'm one of the members on this side who would see this as a journey that we are just starting. This is going to be an area of opportunity for government, but it is going to be an area where we have to remain ever vigilant, given the potential for unexpected and very dangerous outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2017 Productivity Commission report, which led to the government's response and to which this bill is a response, did talk about the importance of creating a new right that enables both opportunities for active data use by consumers and fundamental reform of Australian's competition policy, but it also talked about the need for a structure for data sharing and release that is risk based and allows for arrangements to be dialled up and down according to different risks. I think that is a very important aspect of any arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill is a first step in the journey. I've seen firsthand how the smart and careful use of data by government can lead to better outcomes, but we do need to be constantly ensuring that whatever protections are in place are state of the art, fit for purpose and appropriately risk rated, and it is only in that way that we should proceed with expanding the use of data by government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the Data Availability and Transparency Bill 2020. I cannot support this bill. The balance between the risk to privacy and the potential benefits is just not there. If we go through the explanatory memorandum of the bill, it notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… The Bill establishes a new data sharing scheme which will serve as a pathway and regulatory framework for sharing public sector data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Public sector data' means your data, Madam Deputy Speaker, and my data and the data of every other one of the 25-million-plus Australians. It goes on:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">'Sharing' involves providing controlled access to data, as distinct from open release to the public.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means is that your data, which you as an individual may wish to keep private, can be given to others. As the minister noted, in his second reading speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is about creating a scheme that will provide controlled access to data to trusted people and organisations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who are these trusted people who can be trusted with Australians' private data? Who are these trusted organisations who can be trusted with Australians' private data? In my mind, the risks of this clearly outweigh the potential benefits. We have seen what has happened over the last two years, where it is now the custom in this country to have to show your medical records to line up, to hire a car or to enter a restaurant. That has become common practice in this country. Medical records that should be your private information are no longer private in this country. We are going down a dark, authoritarian track towards a society of digital identity, and I cannot stand and support this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadd</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">en</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I thank all those who have contributed to the debate. I especially thank the member for Maribyrnong for his constructive leadership and his support. It has been quite a pleasure to work with him. I also thank Deborah Anton, the Interim National Data Commissioner up until 2021. I thank Gayle Milnes, the National Data Commissioner Designate, for her work. I thank Kelly Wood, Susan Calvert, Paul Menzies-McVey and the ONDC team for their hard work and professionalism. I thank the senior CIOs of government—Chris Fechner, Charles McHardie, and, from the ATO, Ramez Katf—for all of their work as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Data Availability and Transparency Bill establishes a new scheme for sharing Australian government data. Underpinned by strong safeguards and simplified efficient processes, the scheme lays the groundwork for world-class data-driven government services that will benefit all Australians. This is critical legislation to advance our collective vision for Australia to become a leading digital economy and data-driven society by 2030. The legislation acts on commitments made by the government in response to the 2017 Productivity Commission inquiry into data availability and use. The Australian government demonstrated the benefits of data sharing in response to the COVID pandemic, establishing pathways for sharing critical data to save lives and livelihoods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee all made recommendations for amendments. The government has carefully considered these recommendations and the dissenting report tabled by the Labor Party senators on the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. I thank all of those who've been involved in this, including the member for Isaacs, for their constructive engagement. This has necessarily been a detailed and considered process. Following these consultations, the government will now move a series of amendments with bipartisan support to clarify and enhance privacy protections and introduce additional safeguards in relation to national security concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst other things, the amendments will clarify that the scheme will not extend to the private sector during its initial establishment. The bill now provides for a review three years after the scheme's commencement, in addition to a review three months after the commencement of any amendments to privacy law which would have a material impact on the scheme. Reviews of the scheme will help ensure that it is operating as intended and remains relevant and adaptable to evolving technology and public expectation, and they will provide an opportunity to consider refinement or expansion in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would also like to thank the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for its detailed consideration of the bill package and take this opportunity to formally respond to the three recommendations made by the committee. The committee's first recommendation was that assurances be provided to parliament about appropriate ongoing oversight by security agencies of data-sharing agreements and potential security risks. The government supports this recommendation and moves an amendment to ensure that data-sharing agreements take effect only once registered by the commissioner rather than upon party signature. This change mitigates potential risks by allowing the commissioner to work with relevant security agencies to identify agreements which may pose security risks or not comply with the Data Availability and Transparency scheme prior to any sharing occurring. In addition, foreign entities are not able to become accredited, which means that data cannot be shared with a foreign entity under the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also related to national security, the committee's second recommendation was that findings of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's inquiry into national security risks affecting the Australian higher education and research sector be taken into account when developing data codes and guidance material for the scheme and inform continued engagement with the national security community. The government supports this recommendation and will respond to outcomes of the inquiry once the final report is released. The government also notes the recently released guidelines to counter foreign interference in the Australian university sector and will consider this guidance in relation to the scheme in addition to the outcomes of the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's final recommendation was that the government consider whether amendments could be made to the Data Availability and Transparency Bill or further clarification added to the EM to provide additional guidance regarding privacy protections, particularly in relation to the de-identification of personal data. The government supports this recommendation and moves amendments to strengthen the privacy protections in the bill. The privacy protections include: minimising the sharing of personal information as far as possible without compromising the data-sharing purpose; prohibiting the re-identification of data that has been de-identified; prohibiting the storing or accessing of personal information outside of Australia; making it mandatory that only accredited data service providers undertake any complex data integration for projects to inform government policies and programs and research and development; and requiring express consent for the sharing of biometric data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, a data code will require consent to be current and specific and will provide that an individual may withdraw consent at any time with retrospective effect. Additional privacy protections will also be imposed dependent upon the data-sharing purpose. Personal information will be able to be shared without consent for the delivery of government services where the individual concerned is receiving the service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Data Availability and Transparency Bill minimises the sharing of personal information for informing government policies and programs and for research and development by promoting de-identification of data. The amendments also respond to concerns raised by Australian Labor Party senators in their dissenting report by increasing penalties, clarifying that data cannot be shared for compliance purposes and ensuring that consideration is given to reviewing the data-sharing scheme if changes to the Privacy Act are implemented following the current review of that act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation takes a significant step forward towards data-driven innovation across the economy, a step towards a future where policy decisions are enriched by strong data and where government services are simple, helpful, respectful and transparent. Australians can have enormous confidence that the new scheme is world-class and that data sharing is the safest and most effective it can be. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>): Today I rise to say that Labor will support the two bills before the House, the Offshore Petroleum (Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Bill 2021 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Bill 2021. Labor referred these bills to a Senate inquiry to ensure thorough parliamentary scrutiny. Labor believes industry and workers must be at the table for this vital reform. I note the publication of the final report of this inquiry on 18 November 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills introduce a temporary levy on offshore petroleum production to recover the Commonwealth's cost of decommissioning the Laminaria and Corallina oil fields and associated infrastructure. This aims to ensure taxpayers are not left to pay for the decommissioning and remediation of these sites. Labor agrees that companies that operate oil and gas infrastructure must be held to the obligations to decommission and remove that infrastructure in a safe and timely way. I have spoken in this place at length regarding the situation in the Laminaria and Corallina oil fields—otherwise known as the NOGA or <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span> fiasco—and the need for broad reform and the regulation of decommissioning of offshore oil and gas infrastructure in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The levy will be at a rate of 48 cents per barrel of oil equivalent and be paid on an annual basis in arrears. The first payment made will be for the 2021 financial year and be payable in the first half of 2022-23, which is why it is important it passes through the House and the other place today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All entities with an ownership interest in a petroleum production licence issued under the Offshore Petroleum Greenhouse Gas Storage Act of 2006 will be liable to pay the levy, which will be administered by the Australian Taxation Office. The levy will be in place until the net costs associated with the decommissioning have been recovered, or 30 June 2030 at the latest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Labor acknowledge the fact that the levy is temporary by design; however, we are rightly sceptical about the level of public consultation the government has undertaken throughout the levy's development. I consistently argued for industry, as well as the workers concerned, to be at the table for the design of this scheme. That's why Labor referred this rate of levy, alongside the bills as a whole, to the Senate: for scrutiny, and to ensure the industry and worker representatives had a voice. The Senate committee inquiry also considered the impacts of this decommissioning work on jobs in offshore gas and related sectors, including shipping and port workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rigorous decommissioning requirements will be an important source of jobs for workers in the oil and gas industry as the energy transition to net zero emissions takes place. Those in the oil and gas sector have suggested to me that the direct spend will be up to $1 billion. This represents, potentially, a $1 billion opportunity to ensure that Australia's decommissioning task is set up properly, to ensure good jobs, safety in those dangerous jobs and good environmental outcomes. That's $1 billion worth of jobs for Australian decommissioning workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report from National Energy Resources Australia in February on the projected total future Australian decommissioning liability found that decommissioning of these facilities would cost $52 billion, based on the total removal of all offshore equipment. There are 1,008 offshore wells; 57 fixed facilities, with 237,000 tonnes topside and 518,000 tonnes underwater; 82 pipelines, with a total length of 4,960 kilometres; plus 205 infield flowlines; 130 umbilicals with a length of 1,500 kilometres; and 535 subsea structures, such as manifolds. There is much work to do. Twenty-seven per cent of this activity may need to take place before 2025, due to facilities that are already disused, and 51 per cent of this work could be due before 2030. About half of this work is in the Northern Carnarvon Basin, off the north-west of the Western Australian coast, between Exmouth and Dampier. Another quarter of this work is in the Bass Strait.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that Australia needs a regulatory system that delivers the planning, monitoring, oversight and enforcement of high-standard decommissioning outcomes for offshore oil and gas infrastructure. In that context, Labor was deeply concerned about gaps in the safety oversight from a regulatory agency. In a Senate economics committee inquiry, the department, DISER, and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, said that, due to the fact that there was no titleholder or operator, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act did not apply to the LamCor decommissioning. This meant that NOPSEMA would be unable to issue enforcement actions. Labor sought better from the government in the application of an occupational health and safety regime in a dangerous industry on the high seas which would have been through a confidential commercial contract. This has been achieved, and better regulations will be there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Senator Anthony Chisholm, who worked on this committee; the Maritime Union of Australia—in particular, Adrian Evans and Penny Howard, who worked very proactively on this matter; Shawn Lambert from the ACTU; and representatives of the ECU and AWU. All these people made extremely constructive representations on behalf of current Australian workers in this industry—an industry they know well. They work on gas platforms on the high seas around this country and know the risks of this sector. It is dangerous work, and it will be an emerging industry in the future as we move, and companies themselves move, quite rightly, to decommissioning assets in an environmentally safe and worker-safe way throughout the coming decades. I thank them all for contacting my office and being very constructive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the government and Minister Pitt and his office, who made an undertaking in relation to ensuring that the operator is subject to the NOPSEMA safety regime. The minister and I agreed that the safety of those workers decommissioning the LamCor well is paramount. I thank him and his office again for the cooperative and collegiate way in which they approached this issue. It's very much in the national interest. I commend these bills to the House and reaffirm Labor's support of them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I am glad for the opportunity to speak in support of the Offshore Petroleum (Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Bill 2021. It's another instalment in the government's response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span> fiasco, which, if unaddressed, would have left the taxpayer picking up a bill of the financial kind of several hundred million dollars that should have been met by the operator, Woodside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This levy is a supportable and sensible means of ensuring the taxpayer does not pay for a very expensive mess that was created by some risky—and, I would say, questionable—corporate conduct. The department and the minister deserve some credit for resolving the trailing liability that was dealt with in an earlier piece of legislation and for bringing along this cost recovery levy. But, based on what we now know, it is a shame that the rigour of our regulatory arrangements wasn't sufficiently good to prevent what occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, when you have a government that is reflexively or, some would say, ideologically dismissive of the regulatory systems that are required to guarantee the public and national interest and that deliver safety and environmental protection and good corporate conduct, this is exactly the kind of thing that will occur: regulatory failure with harmful consequences. We're fortunate that, so far, the mess is only administrative and economic in nature, rather than a mess that could well have involved very real hazards to worker safety and to the marine environment. No-one in the Australian community would be unaware of the kinds of things that have happened in the past that have involved offshore oil spills, like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Deepwater Horizon</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Exxon Valdez </span>disasters and others. In addition to causing costs in the tens of billions of dollars, they left awful environmental legacies across hundreds and hundreds of kilometres that have lasted decades and, in most cases, continue today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Brand has done some very important work on this bill and in response to this issue more generally, and, as the shadow minister just described, worked with the government to particularly address some aspects of the government's response that raise questions about whether we had the right occupational health and safety settings in these measures. The shadow minister already described those, but their importance should not be underestimated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge that the industry peak body, APPEA, ultimately came on board in supporting the measures required to ensure that companies take appropriate responsibility for their decommissioning obligations and that the taxpayer is therefore protected from picking up the tab. In essence, what occurred with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern End</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eavour </span>was the sale or transfer of an end-of-life offshore oil production asset from Woodside to a small company with insufficient operating experience and capability and with completely insufficient financial standing. Woodside essentially transferred the asset for what was a relatively tiny sum and by providing some financial assistance to the purchaser. The reason Woodside did that was: there was significant value in them not having to bear the decommissioning cost. It's not surprising that, within a very short time, the company that received the asset proved incapable of operating the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span>. We should be grateful that NOPSEMA was relatively quick off the mark and was resolute in holding the operator to account and in preventing what may have escalated towards something fatal, in human terms, or environmentally disastrous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that NOPSEMA considers is the adequacy of the spill response arrangements and preparations, which are critical when it comes to offshore oil and gas. In this case I think it's notable to record that, when NOPSEMA carried out some inspections on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span>, it determined that the new operator had:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… an inadequate capability and capacity to support and sustain a protracted response resulting in short and long term biological, ecological and social harm in the event of an uncontrolled hydrocarbon release.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, they weren't in any position to safely respond if there had been some kind of oil spill. There would have been short- and long-term biological, ecological and social harm if that had occurred. NOPSEMA also found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… failure to maintain the oil spill response arrangements provided for by the current TSA would result in an immediate and significant threat to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what happened next? Operations were stopped. Not that much further down the track, the Timor Sea Oil &amp; Gas Australia company—that's the company that received the asset—went into administration and liquidation. It left the Australian government to step in and arrange for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span> to be operated in lighthouse mode and then to arrange a proper decommissioning. That process continues and will take some time, as the shadow minister has described. Some tenders were actually issued earlier this year, and the government has already provided something like $230 million for the expected work. I don't think that will be the end of it. The $230 million includes $8 million paid to Woodside for their expert advice. I reckon some people in the community would think that payment is pretty rich in all the circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said 'questionable' earlier, in terms of the whole arrangement. I think this is an important point to make and certainly for people in the community to understand. I said 'questionable' because it is quite hard to look at the circumstances around the disposal of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span> and take the view that Woodside disposed of the infrastructure while giving due and reasonable consideration to the possibility that the receiving entity was not in a solid position to safely and properly operate the rig and was in no position to safely and properly decommission it. It is hard to believe that an operator of the capability and scale and experience of Woodside didn't foresee that possibility. In any case, this bill helps fix a serious and costly problem, but we know there's further work to be done to ensure this kind of thing doesn't occur again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the upside, we should ensure that the considerable volume of decommissioning work in prospect is undertaken by an Australian decommissioning industry and by Australian workers. On that front, I welcome the establishment of CODA, the Centre of Decommissioning Australia, and I'm grateful to have met with the general manager, Dr Francis Norman, on a couple of occasions. It's pretty incredible to reflect on the fact that $60 billion of offshore decommissioning will be required in the next 30 years—that is by 2050—and half of that in the next 10 years. It's a very substantial and important piece of work. If it's not done well, there will be unacceptable risks in terms of worker safety and in terms of harm to our marine environment. If it is done well, there's the potential for a state-of-the-art Australian decommissioning industry to be created, supporting investment, innovation, infrastructure and Australian jobs that are all relevant to our broader maritime capability in shipbuilding, marine science and offshore renewable energy, and—with my recycling hat on—in resource recovery and recycling. That is what we should all hope for. That is what we should aim for. It's entirely possible and it's the right way to go, but it will require some concerted and rapid work from government in partnership with industry. As we have seen, there really is no time at all to waste. I'm glad to support this bill.</span>

This bill is the culmination of one particular gas corporation's complete and utter stranglehold over both of the establishment parties and, through that, over parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Woodside donates $220,000 a year—every single year—to Labor and the Liberals. They offer not just cash but perks. More than a couple of ministers have left parliament to work for them and countless numbers of advisers too. Woodside has extraordinary access to our lawmakers. How else can they shift a billion-dollar liability off their books and onto everyone else in their industry?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support this bill because getting any money out of gas corporations for the public benefit is like drawing blood from a stone. It is a miracle to get money out of a sector the ATO has called 'systemic nonpayers of tax'. Still, the Greens aren't going to gloss over the fact that something about this bill doesn't sit right. Woodside have acted like bandits—extracted all their profits, paid no taxes, and then punted the old and depleted <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Endeavour</span> oil rig off to a fly-by-night businessman who went bankrupt shortly afterwards, leaving the government holding the can to cover the clean-up costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than force Woodside to take back the asset they made billions in revenue from and force them to clean it up, the power of Woodside's lobbying, donations and future job offers meant that Minister Pitt decided that the entire gas industry has to pay to clean up after Woodside. No company, outside of such a massive coal or gas donor, could ever get away with such negligent or greedy conduct. But here is the kicker: the Australian Liberal government has since paid Woodside $9 million for expert advice on how to decommission their old oil and gas field. In a perfect culmination of corporate state capture, Woodside has been rewarded to the tune of $9 million for sucking a well dry and pushing the clean-up costs onto others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, Woodside misled the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> and the public that they 'transitioned the vessel over in good condition', when the facts of the Walker report show there were massive corrosion hazards. This is just the latest in a long line of governments doing Woodside's bidding. The Howard government bugged the cabinet room of the East Timor government to help Woodside's commercial negotiations over oilfields between our territorial waters. As a result, they had access to confidential national security information that not even this parliament would have had access to. It is now subject to the Witness K prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foreign minister at the time, Alexander Downer, left parliament and went to work for them. Labor's previous resources minister, Gary Gray, was a senior executive for them. The Liberals' previous resources minister, Ian Macfarlane, is currently on their board. Woodside is not just a publicly listed company, it's a hybrid public-private apprenticeship. They're a hybrid government department. They can write laws, hold classified documents, provide and receive cash flows, second staff and set their own environmental and safety standards, and can authorise other entities to take on their liabilities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until we cut off the tentacles of these big coal and gas corporations, we won't be able to turn the ship of government around on the climate crisis. These companies take what they want and leave the mess for others to clean up. Their pollution is turbocharging natural disasters that we have to pay to clean up. And, according to NOPSEMA, in answer to Greens senator Dorinda Cox, there are 400 disused gas wells in Australian waters that haven't been decommissioned. There are 19 mothballed platforms sitting there without being decommissioned. This is their legacy. And it's their legacy, not ours, to pay to clean up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want the big polluters and corporations that are profiting from the climate crisis to pay to clean up the damage they are doing. It is time to make the big corporations pay their fair share. It is time to stop giving money to the big coal, oil and gas corporations and, instead, make them pay their fair share. Only the Greens are able to push for that, because we're the only ones not taking money from corporations like Woodside. When you look across the entire gas industry, you see that, in one year, tens of billions of dollars of profit are being brought in and not one cent of tax is being paid. No wonder the Australian tax office calls them systemic nonpayers of tax. It is time to make the big corporations pay to clean up the mess that they are inflicting on all of us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum (Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Bill 2021 and cognate bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Bill 2021. These bills will introduce a temporary levy on offshore petroleum production to recover the costs of decommissioning these oilfields and other associated infrastructure. Let's be clear: we shouldn't be in this position. This is a responsibility of those companies. These oilfields, situated 550 kilometres offshore of Darwin, the LamCor oilfields, were first commissioned in 1999. At the time it was a $1.37 billion development that was projected to produce up to 180,000 barrels per day. Now they no longer produce any and remain in lighthouse mode. These bills stem from the disastrous decision in 2016 by Woodside and Talisman Energy to sell both the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span> and LamCor oilfields to a small oil and gas speculator called Northern Oil and Gas Australia that could not afford to decommission it and in 2020 went into liquidation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Announced in the 2021-22 budget, this bill will introduce a levy on the industry to recoup the almost $1 billion in costs that have been heaped on the taxpayer. It's ironic—coming from a government that continually talks about not wanting to introduce taxes—that, in fact, here is one. The levy will be set at 48 cents per barrel. This levy will fluctuate, depending on how much cost is being recovered. The levy could go from 1 July 2021 to 1 July 2029 but will terminate when the costs have been recovered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real question is: why stop there? Of course the industry is fighting this levy tooth and nail, but it will not find any sympathy from the broader community for its plight. In fact, what we should have is this levy continuing. It's time the industry paid its way—not just on this but on the other related issues, like climate change and natural disasters. Earlier this year, I talked on the bill that implemented the decommissioning framework for other ageing assets, and the levy for the recoup of costs associated with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span> fiasco. The problems are the same. The decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure will be a growing issue over the coming years. The industry has absolutely no problem in putting rigs in the ocean, but it has serious difficulties in decommissioning safely, at a minimum cost, and taking responsibility for doing it. It's exacerbated by the industry struggling to find buyers for ageing assets, as more investors are now conscious of the risks—climate or otherwise—of taking on such assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Risen Energy reported that the number of oil and gas wells waiting to be decommissioned will rise from 160 today to 440 by 2026. That is only four years away. Clearly this is a growing and looming problem. We need to make sure that the decommissioning of these rigs takes place in a safe and orderly way and that it is done with proper environmental conservation and clean-up. And we know this is coming in coming decades. The cost of decommissioning should not be heaped on taxpayers, because the cost is substantial and, ultimately, it is not their responsibility; it is the companies'—and the government's, for allowing these companies to have impunity as to these rigs. We know that the onshore and offshore decommissioning liability of the industry could be some $60 billion over the next 30 years. With Australia's net debt approaching a trillion dollars, we need more than ever to be cognisant of this cost, and it cannot be put on the taxpayer. Already we know that the cost of the consequences of the love affair with fossil fuel is put on the taxpayer. We need a permanent fund that will act as a backstop for the inevitable issues that will arise with decommissioning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Actually, the government needs to do more. We need a climate disaster levy to collect money from oil and gas companies that leave environmental destruction in their wake. It's currently the Australian taxpayer who foots the bill for all these climate related natural disasters. We know that, just this year, the bill is $6 billion, due to the floods on the east coast. We know that the cost of natural disasters is projected to reach some $96 billion a year by 2060, under the current business-as-usual actions. That is over $1.2 trillion by 2060. This is one unfolding disaster after the next. Just in the course of this government, the cost has been $10.3 billion on floods and bushfires alone. It should not be up to the taxpayer to meet this cost. We need to start talking about a natural disaster or climate disaster levy to be put on those responsible. If we set a levy of $1 per ton of embodied carbon, we could raise a significant amount to offset these costs. The Australia Institute's polling indicates that 65 per cent of the public would back these sensible measures. But of course what we need to do is to stop expanding gas—to stop having more and more of these gas fields—because, if not, we are just dooming future generations to an ongoing crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, there is a strong community rejection of any offshore oil and gas. We pushed this government to reject once and for all the exploration licence in relation to the PEP-11 area from Newcastle to Manly for exploration of oil and gas. It's time we did this for all of our offshore areas. But the minister, a Nationals minister, can only see fossil fuels in our future. He wants to expand gas fields. The most ridiculous one is around the prime tourism area of the Twelve Apostles, near Port Campbell on the Victorian coast. Of course he sees no trouble in expanding this to fossil fuel extraction. Developing this area will be terrible for the local economy and tourism, the climate and the local environment. It is adding fuel to the fire. So, whilst I support this levy and this bill today, to ensure that the cost of decommissioning these rigs is imposed not on the taxpayer but on the industry, it is time this industry pays its way and ensures it cleans up the mess it is causing.</span>

The purpose of the levy is to ensure that taxpayers are not left to pay for the decommissioning or the remediation. The levy is temporary, and that's the point to remember. Commencement of the levy will be on 1 July 2021 and pay in arrears a rate of 48c per barrel or oil equivalent production for the year. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on behalf of the Labor Party on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Family Support) Bill 2022. Labor supports this because we are backing veterans and their families. From the outset, I want to say families play a critical and fundamental role in supporting the capability of our Defence Force and in the wellbeing of Defence Force members. We on this side know that if we want a strong and capable defence force operating at its best, then we need the best possible care and support available for family members. The responsibility to care for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, veterans and families currently rests with our generation. We must do everything we can to support them and to give them the care and treatment they deserve and the best possible care and treatment our country can provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor joins with the government in recognising the unique challenges faced by these families. Supporting the partners and children of our defence personnel is an ongoing and evolving effort. This legislation responds to the recommendations of the final report of an inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The constant battle</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">suicide by veterans</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which was initiated by Labor. It responds also to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into veteran support, which recommended better family engagement and support by agencies. We welcome that the government has finally responded, albeit on the eve of an election. I might add, for the benefit of those who might be listening, that this is a budget measure from 2021 that we are debating after the 2022 budget was handed down, so I chastise and criticise the government for their failure to bring this on earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package will be available to more working-age veterans and families through expanded eligibility. It synchronises, in large part, the family support package, which is akin to an NDIS package, for people under 65 years of age, widows and widowers of Defence Force personnel. It harmonises the MRCA, DRCA and VA legislation—acronyms which would be very familiar to those in the defence community. I support the legislation. It will help families of veterans, widows and widowers. It will make sure that they get assistance. The package and the support will kick in on 1 July this year. This bill makes sure that there is a legislative framework there. We in Labor trust the government will do the legislative instruments it has said it requires to do to implement the enhanced family support package. We trust the government to do the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we are committed to supporting veterans and their families. We want to make sure that our servicemen and women, veterans and their families, know that this country is proud of them, that our country will always be there for them and that we will back them every step of the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Labor Party, I say we will support the legislation. I do say the government is tardy in bringing it forward and needs to do better. They need to do better, not just with the way they conduct themselves in this chamber, in bringing legislation on this late in the day, but also in making sure that they do in budgetary requirements. I support the legislation.</span>

The practical support for veterans and families that comes out of this bill is welcome, and that's why we want to get it through. We want to get it done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to take a moment to say that we have to do a lot better by our veterans in this country. We have had six ministers for veterans affairs over nine years. That's an incredible turnover. In any other workplace, you might think that there were some significant problems, considering that this important portfolio has been handed around so often by those opposite. It shouldn't be a prize for factional battles. It should be of the utmost importance, because it has real-world effects—including in my electorate, where there is still no proper wellbeing centre after I committed to one six years ago. Successive governments have failed to make sure that it was up and running, as promised, on time. We need to do a lot better, and I look forward to seeing a Labor government to make sure that that comes to pass.</span>

The enhanced family support package will be available to more veteran families through expanded eligibility, benefiting approximately 900 veterans and their families in the first year of the program. Intensive support will become available for families to adjust to new or challenging life circumstances, complementing other Department of Veterans' Affairs and Australian government services.</span>

In addition, families with children will be able to access a further $10,000 per year for each child under school age, and $5,000 per year for each primary-school-aged child until the child reaches high school age. Veterans will no longer require warlike service nor to be undertaking a rehabilitation plan to be eligible. Under this initiative, the family support package will be expanded to support widows and widowers under all three acts that support veterans, where the veteran's death was due to their service. This package provides widowed partners under 65 years of age up to $27,835 each year for two years. Widowed partners with children will have access to the additional amounts each year to tailor support for their health and wellbeing needs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  It's always a pleasure to rise in this House and speak about small business, because this government has a record of supporting small business across our community and across this country, and particularly across my electorate of Forde. The schedules in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Tax Integrity and Supporting Business Investment) Bill 2022 go towards further enhancing our support for small business whilst at the same time ensuring the integrity of our tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me first take the opportunity to look at our support for small business over the past several years. Looking at the measures that we've put in place for small business over our term of government, since 2013, we now see small business in a situation where it pays the lowest tax rate it has paid in many, many years, compared to previous governments. The benefit of a lower tax rate for small business is that it gives small business the incentive to invest and to grow, because more of the money that they earn through their hard work each and every day stays in their pocket. We know that many of our small businesses out there, who are the majority of employers in Australia, put on the line, each and every day, their family wealth. Their house is mortgaged to support their business overdraft. Very often, our small-business owners are the last people to be paid. They ensure they pay their staff and their suppliers, and then they take a cut out of what's left at the end of the week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at these small businesses as we go around our electorates—and I've got the member for Wright here, who's my electoral neighbour—and what I find fascinating is that, when we talk about innovation in this country, it is our small-business community that leads innovation. Big business today has become much like the bureaucracy of the Public Service. It's our small to medium businesses that drive innovation, new ideas and change to make our economy a better and more productive economy. They are involved in our local communities. They support our sporting clubs. They support our community organisations. As we have seen with the floods in my electorate—and I spoke about this earlier today in the Federation Chamber—so many small businesses in my electorate of Forde have put a hand out to help those affected by the floods, to give them a hand up. Yes, we've received support from some great large businesses, but the majority of support has been from great small businesses across my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I am proud of the work that this government has done over the past eight years to support small business. As I said, lower tax rates, the instant asset write-off, the instant depreciation of capital expenditure—all of those things go to reducing the cost of running a small business, because you don't need to carry those items on your balance sheet; you can write them off in the year of the expense, when you buy that new ute or that new piece of equipment. And when we talk about small business, it's not just the people who have a bricks-and-mortar shopfront. It includes our tradies—our sparkies, our plumbers, our brickies and our tilers. All those people are small-business people as well. All these measures that we have implemented over the past few years go to support those very people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us today seeks to further assist and make it easier for small business to understand their record-keeping obligations, and, if a business is genuinely struggling to keep appropriate tax records, the commissioner will be allowed to offer the business the alternative of undertaking a record-keeping course rather than paying financial penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That actually feeds into our budget announcement last night of a tax deduction for small businesses for every $100 they spend—on new IT equipment, to upgrade their systems, to put in place a cloud storage system or to buy a Xero accounting package or something like that to upgrade the efficiency of their business. This dovetails with that very nicely, because part of supporting small businesses is giving them the incentive to upgrade their systems and capacity to do these things better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The education course that will be provided under this legislation will be free and will take approximately two hours to complete. It is expected to be delivered online. Can I also say that many of the online accounting and bookkeeping software packages that are available today do wonderful work in this space in terms of tutorial and other resources to make it easier for small business owners to manage their business. We know that many of our small business owners are not just the owner of the business; they're also the bookkeeper, the HR manager—all these things that come up in the course of running their small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this bill ensure that there are more appropriate sanctions available for assisting small businesses struggling with their record-keeping rather than applying automatic financial penalties. I think that is a very worthwhile process, in terms of supporting small business through what we know has been, over the past two years, a very difficult time. Again, this government has supported small business through that—and I've touched on a couple of the measures—but also through Jobkeeper. A lot of the small businesses in my electorate of Forde that I have spoken to have shared with me how important Jobkeeper was to them in ensuring that they kept their doors open and kept their employees engaged in the business. We know how vital keeping employees engaged in the business and keeping business activity turning over and providing support and income to our community has been to the fact that our economy is now in the position it is in, after two years of COVID. I recognise that there have been different outcomes in different states, given different decisions by various state governments. But these things all go towards ensuring that we have a viable, profitable small-business sector that continues to support our economy and innovation and capability for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, schedule 3 of this bill provides taxpayers with the option to claim deductions in line with an asset's actual economic life rather than mandating the effective life prescribed by statute. Currently, for certain depreciating intangible assets—such as patents, copyrights and in-house software—the tax law specifies the effective life of the assets for depreciation purposes. This measure applies to intangible assets acquired from 1 July 2023 after the temporary full expensing which applies to both tangible and intangible assets has concluded. Again, this is an important part of the government's Digital Economy Strategy, which was announced in the 2021-22 budget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  This budget of bribes makes the climate crisis worse, locks in tax cuts for the wealthy and makes housing more expensive. The budget gives coal, oil and gas corporations more than $37 billion but cuts climate spending by 35 per cent. If you're on a low income, you get a one-off $420 payment. But a billionaire gets $9,075—not as a one-off but every year, as a tax cut. There's $13 billion of public money—your money—going to push up housing prices, but no new money to build affordable homes. The good news is: we are less than 50 days from kicking this terrible government out, and this budget shows why that day can't come soon enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coal and gas are the main causes of the climate crisis. Gas is as dirty as coal. We need to get off coal and gas, not give them more of the public's money. We need to make coal and gas corporations pay a fair share of tax, not pay them to mine and burn our future. The Prime Minister has admitted that the climate crisis is making the country harder to live in, but this budget puts people's lives at risk. There's $300 million to open up new gas fields like the Beetaloo and $50 million for gas pipelines we don't need. Vague promises from Liberal and Labor to get to net zero by 2050 won't make up for opening more coal and gas mines. There are 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline, backed by Liberal and Labor. In the middle of a climate crisis, they are throwing more fuel on the fire. This budget funds more floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The floods turbocharge that other crisis we're facing: the housing crisis. This budget makes housing more expensive. The Liberal Party—with Labor's support, it must be said—are handing $13 billion to the wealthy and property investors, which just pushes up prices for first home buyers, locks people out of housing and drives up rents, which are growing three times faster than wages. Four hundred thousand women over the age of 45 remain at risk of homelessness, and renters and first home buyers are getting locked out. But this budget uses public money—your money—to put housing even further out of reach. Unless we change course, young people simply won't be able to ever afford a home of their own and will struggle to keep up with rising rents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I was in the Northern Rivers, where the floods ruined thousands of homes. Today, parts of Byron Bay, Lismore and other areas are again flooded. I was there with our local Greens candidate, Mandy Nolan, who joined me here in Canberra this week before returning to help her community deal with the floods. Her message to the Treasurer this week was the same one that I heard in Richmond before the floods. Before the floods, the Northern Rivers of New South Wales was one of the least affordable places to live in the country. Many people are still rebuilding from the fires two years ago. They needed action on the housing crisis years ago, and they need it now. But the Prime Minister was in hiding, offering no answers to people now struggling to find long-term, affordable and secure homes as they rebuild their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor backs the billions of dollars in the budget going to investors and the very wealthy, which will put housing out of reach of even more people. That's why people in places from the Northern Rivers to inner-city Brisbane and Melbourne now back the Greens' plan to axe the handouts to people with more than one investment home and to build one million affordable homes that people can buy into for $300,000 or rent as public housing for 25 per cent of their income. That would tackle the housing affordability crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also makes Australia a more unequal place by dismantling our progressive tax system. The tax measures in this budget, which Labor backs, will see someone on the minimum wage pay the same tax rate as a CEO. By siding with the Liberals on the budget's stage 3 tax cuts, Labor and Liberal are introducing a flat-tax system—a trickle-down nightmare, ripping $184 billion out of the budget so there's less money for public schools and hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>It is clear now that this government will not keep us safe. This government will not keep people safe from the climate crisis and won't put a secure roof over your head. But the Greens will. We will kick this government out, build affordable housing and keep coal and gas in the ground. We will tackle the housing crisis, we will cap rents and we will give renters more rights. We will push for a freeze on all new coal and gas projects, restore a price on pollution, drive investment in clean energy and make Australia a renewable energy superpower. This unfair budget shows it's time to kick the Liberals out. It is time to put the Greens in balance of power. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chie</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">f Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I'm pleased to say that this is a budget that has delivered for many, many Australians and many, many people across my electorate of Forde. I look at this budget and look at what we're doing as a government—and we acknowledge that there are people hurting as a result of the cost-of-living rises. Sadly, most of these issues, such as supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine, are out of our control. That's why we've moved to introduce a number of measures to cut the cost of living and reduce the impact of these increases. One of the biggest hits to the hip pocket has come at the petrol bowser, and that's why I'm pleased to see that, in the budget handed down last night, we have slashed the fuel excise by half for the next six months. It will mean a 22c-a-litre saving, which is roughly $30 a week for a two-car family or $700 over six months. Tens of thousands of motorists in my electorate of Forde will benefit from this move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also includes a one-off $420 cost-of-living tax offset, which will benefit thousands of people across the electorate of Forde, particularly in places like Eagleby, Beenleigh, Loganlea, Boronia Heights, Waterford West and Logan Reserve. There's a $250 cost-of-living payment to be delivered to over six million pensioners, carers, veterans, jobseekers and concession card holders, including, importantly, self-funded retirees who have a concession card. That's a benefit to some 17,000 pensioners across the electorate of Forde.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Logan area in my electorate is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia, including, I should add, the northern Gold Coast. And the member for Wright, who is here in the chamber, also represents an area that is growing very, very quickly. If you drive around, you see the new houses springing up in places like Park Ridge, Pimpama, Ormeau, Yatala and Holmview, and into the member for Wright's electorate at Yarrabilba, Flagstone and New Beith. All of those sit next to each other, and you'd be amazed at the difference in the number of houses from 10 years ago, when we both first got elected, to the number now; it is extraordinary. It's why I am so pleased to see, in this budget, the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme being expanded to 50,000 places, which allows even more people in my electorate to be able to purchase their first home with as little as a five per cent deposit. We know, from talking to our constituents about the rents they're paying now, the difficulty of accruing a 20 per cent deposit to avoid lenders mortgage insurance, which is getting increasingly expensive. So this measure will be of enormous benefit to many in my community and, I'm sure, in the member for Wright's community as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, one of the joys of growth—as you would know, Mr Speaker—is a need for infrastructure. I can say that I'm very proud of the announcements in this budget for the electorate of Forde, the largest of which was a $1.21 billion upgrade to the Brisbane to Gold Coast rail line from Beenleigh to Kuraby for a faster rail upgrade. The number of tracks will be increased from two to four; there will also be improvements to seven stations, including Beenleigh, Bethania, Loganlea, Edens Landing and Holmview, and five level crossings will be removed. These works are scheduled to begin in 2024 and to create 6,700 direct and indirect jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>In other budget boosts for my community, there's a $4 million investment in the Beenleigh Connection Road and City Road intersection in the north of the centre of Beenleigh and $11 million for a business case for future stages of the Coomera Connector. This is in addition to a number of major investments in road infrastructure already occurring across the electorate. My priority is to see our roads made safer and to reduce congestion. Not only do we need to get people home to their families more safely; we also need to ensure that the tradies and the businesspeople in our community are able to get from one place of work to the other more quickly. I am pleased to say the Morrison government continues to deliver for the community of Forde.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  In public hospitals across Australia patients have free access to bandaids, bandages, painkillers and incontinence pads. But what most Australians may not know is that there is no guarantee that you will have access to period products in hospitals if you need them. While some hospitals provide period products, it's not mandatory. This variation leads to limited availability and forces patients to rely on their family, if they have them, to bring pads when they visit or on the kindness of doctors, nurses and staff to give pads of their own. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Periods are not a choice. When you're in hospital already feeling sick, stressed and vulnerable, the last thing on your mind should be trying to work out how to source a pad or tampon. Pads should be freely and easily accessible in all hospitals for patients who need them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In public hospitals across Australia, patients can get band-aids, bandages, painkillers, or incontinence aids, but not sanitary items when they need them. Through the #PadUpPublicHealth campaign, Share the Dignity has listened to thousands of harrowing stories from Australian's who have not had access to period products while in hospital. Some have been forced to bleed through their hospital gowns. Others have had to use unsuitable alternatives like dressings or adult nappies. While some hospitals do provide period products, it is not mandatory for them to do so. When provision is managed at an individual hospital level, availability can be limited, and patients have relied on the kindness of doctors, nurses and staff who give pads of their own. Menstruation is not a choice, and women, girls and those who menstruate should not have to worry about how they manage their period at any point, especially when they are sick and vulnerable. Pads should be free and easily accessible in all hospitals for patients who need them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to implement a Federal policy mandating the provision of free pads, upon request, to all patients being cared for in public hospitals nationally. Women's and girls' ability to safely manage their menstrual hygiene is associated with basic human rights including non-discrimination, access to education and participation in public and professional life. This policy is therefore in line with global movements acknowledging menstrual hygiene as a fundamental human right and a critical link in achieving gender equality.</span>

                  </a>  Share the Dignity has listened to thousands of harrowing stories from Australians who have been stuck in hospital with their period without access to period products. Jennifer gave birth at the Royal Brisbane Women's Hospital last year and forgot to pack pads in her hospital bag. After being told by her midwife that the hospital didn't have any pads, Jennifer had to send her husband to the chemist to buy some for her. Sue went to the ER with her period, and when she asked for a pad all they could give her was an incontinence pad. Tammy was having a miscarriage in the emergency department and all she was given were three paper towels from a toilet to use. Other women shared stories of having been forced to bleed through their hospital gowns. This petition calls on the House to implement a federal policy mandating the provision of free pads upon request to all patients being cared for in public hospitals nationally. </span>

I would like to thank the founder of Share the Dignity, Rochelle Courtenay, and her team for their tireless advocacy in this space and their ongoing fight to end period poverty.

Squirrelled away on page 19 of the third budget paper is a $20 million cut to Queensland Health funding this financial year. You would think that, as we enter the third year of a global pandemic, the Morrison government would see the value in investing in health care, but, no, they have cut Queensland Health's budget for the next financial year. The next time a member of the LNP comes to this place or to the state parliament to complain about ramping or about the shortage of hospital beds or about surgery wait queues, please remember this budget cut. It demonstrates yet again that the coalition cannot be trusted with Medicare or with our health, and they cannot be trusted to govern. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Australians have been confronted with many challenges over the last three years. We've been faced with devastation and heartbreak, including natural disasters like the recent flooding in my electorate of Bonner. We have been navigating the turmoil and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have faced threats from foreign countries attempting to interfere in our domestic affairs and testing the capabilities of our military. Despite all this, our economic recovery is leading the world, and, more than ever, Australians are being provided opportunities and supports to invest in their futures and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no other place where this is more true than in my electorate of Bonner, and, in my opinion, there is no better place in the world to build a life and start a family than Bonner. I've been a local resident for over four decades. I attended school, started a small business and am now raising my own family there. I want Bonner to be a place where everyone can come to raise a family, start a business and invest in their future also.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To do this, I am working hard to deliver my plan to ensure local residents have access to the resources and opportunities they need to pursue their dreams and thrive. I am committed to continuing to fix local roads and reduce traffic congestion. I've already delivered over $200 million for local road projects and infrastructure upgrades, including at Newnham and Wecker roads, Rochedale roundabout and Lindum crossing. I will continue to fight for more funding to fix local black spots and ensure residents can get home sooner and safer to their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been a fierce advocate to protect our way of life and our local environment, working alongside community groups like Ocean Crusaders, Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee and Mackenzie Bushcare. I'm also passionate about expanding our sporting facilities to make them easily accessible for local families and I have provided federal funding for sporting groups like the Bayside United Football Club, the Mount Gravatt Vultures and the Carindale district junior Aussie rules club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic plan is working, and we are delivering lower taxes and record jobs, and I'm seeing these benefits firsthand in Bonner. New trainee and apprenticeship commencements are up by over 90 per cent. Over 1,700 families are saving $2,000 a year on child care, and over 68,000 taxpayers in Bonner will benefit from our tax relief measures. This means the hardworking people of Bonner can keep more of their own money in their own pockets. We've also seen record investment in health and education, providing higher-quality care and greater learning opportunities to Bonner families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who is passionate about mental health, I will continue to fight for more services and funding across Bonner. There have already been so many positive developments from my mental health plan. I've had great community consultation and roundtable discussions with mental health experts and have partnered with groups like Roses in the Ocean to trial pop-up safe spaces on the Bayside.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also working with groups to ensure that we are reducing emissions and increasing renewable energy. Over 25,000 rooftop solar panels have been installed in Bonner, and it's exciting to see new green energy technology developments from local businesses like Tritium and Wildfire in Murarrie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible spirit of the people of Bonner and our wider Brisbane community. The recent flooding event was heartbreaking for so many families, and, after seeing firsthand the devastation caused by these floods, I can say that I'm humbled by how resilient the people of Bonner are. Alongside my team, Brisbane City Councillor Lisa Atwood and countless Bonner residents, I spent days delivering sandbags, food, water and generators to flood affected residents. The people of Bonner do not hide during a crisis, and as the rain came down and the water rose I was out there with my community, gumboots and all, making sure local families were safe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bonner is a great place to live, raise a family and build a life. I am committed to delivering for the residents of Bonner and continuing to work with the community to protect our lifestyle and help locals get ahead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  My community on the Central Coast of New South Wales has been overlooked by this government for years. Whether it's our health, jobs or local roads, this government has left the northern end of the Central Coast behind. Under this government we've seen the GP crisis on the coast go from bad to worse. We have one of the worst roads backlogs in the state. We have thousands of young people held back from gaining the skills and training they need for a good job and a steady career. This has all happened on the Morrison government's watch. Now, after almost a decade in power and on the eve of an election, this government is spruiking spending in my community, promising big-ticket road and rail projects for our region. It's no surprise locals have had a hard time believing them. They have made promises like this before and have not followed through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't need to read the NRMA report to know that the Central Coast has one of the worst roads backlogs in New South Wales. In fact, the last major roads project on the Central Coast was the M1 upgrade, which started when Anthony Albanese was the minister for infrastructure. We have been calling for more investment for years, but this government hasn't listened. Then, just last week, the government announced funding to upgrade the road through Wyong, my hometown—a project my community and I have been fighting for for years. This week, they have announced spending for the Central Coast Highway and fast rail. While this investment is welcome, it's long overdue. Why has the government waited until the eve of an election? The coast should be a priority when it comes to infrastructure funding, not an afterthought right before an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also failed our community when it comes to their health care. I am a pharmacist and I worked at the local hospital for almost 10 years. There is a severe GP shortage on the coast, and this crisis has only gone from bad to worse under the Morrison government. I was told this week, alarmingly, that 31 doctors have left our community in the Wyong-Gorokan catchment, leading to countless practices being forced to close their books or shut. While I welcome the government's plan to make parts of the coast a priority for GPs, I am frustrated that they have completely overlooked other parts of our region and haven't addressed the widespread systemic problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many people in my community struggling to see a GP, waiting weeks for routine appointments. One of my constituents from Hamlyn Terrace recently told me that her GP practice now has been reduced to two doctors on the books. One of those doctors is now on annual leave, and the other was recently forced to isolate due to COVID. This meant patients only had access to telehealth appointments for an entire week. My constituent told me: 'Like a lot of elderly people, I find it hard to hear on the telephone and don't do telehealth calls because the doctor ends up shouting down the phone. It's very frustrating. I won't see a doctor now until my GP comes back, and then I'll have to have my flu and pneumonia vaccines.' People in my community or anywhere in Australia shouldn't have to delay or skip important vaccinations or health check-ups. They should be able to book an appointment and get the health care they need, especially older Australians. This government has ignored the plight of my community, and it's only harder to see a GP for people living on the coast. Either the government doesn't see health care as a priority for regional Australians, or they just don't get it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also overlooked the Central Coast when it comes to jobs and training. I grew up on the coast; I went to high school in Tuggerah. After almost a decade in power, this government has cut $3 billion from vocational education and training in this country. Because of these cuts—and we have seen it—there are now 231 fewer apprentices on the coast than there were eight years ago. That's a drop of close to 10 per cent. That's 231 people—particularly, young people—who don't have the chance to get the skills and training they need for a good job and a steady career. How can the government be serious about creating jobs on the coast when they are taking opportunities away from young people to find secure work? In a recent example, they completely excluded the north end of the coast in their Commonwealth Scholarships Program for young Australians. While young people living in Gosford, just south of my community, are eligible for $13,000 scholarships to help them take up an apprenticeship, people in my community have been left out altogether. How can the government claim now that they want to deliver for the Central Coast, particularly for young people? They have had close to a decade to deliver, but what we have heard is empty promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community is fed up with being overlooked. Under this Prime Minister, Australia is now $1 trillion in debt, and what have they seen? What have we got to show for it? A GP crisis, a massive backlog of roads and thousands of coasties who can't find secure work. Instead of planning for the future, this budget is focused on short-term fixes and patch jobs. Nothing in this budget makes up for almost a decade of being overlooked by this government. Coasties deserve better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONNELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  To paraphrase Winston Churchill: democracy is the least-worst system of government. Since its foundation in ancient Greece, we still haven't found a better method of reflecting the public will in a peaceful and effective way. For those of us who enjoy the temporary privilege of holding the torch of democracy as elected leaders, this is an immense reward. Like all previous members for the federal electorate of Stirling, I've worked with great determination to serve our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With Stirling due to be abolished from the next federal election, I reflect today on the history of this wonderful division. Contested in 25 elections, the seat has been won by 14 Liberal and 11 ALP members. Liberals have proudly held the seat for a total of 37 years. I acknowledge the previous Liberal members: Doug Cash, Ian Viner, Eoin Cameron and Michael Keenan. I also acknowledge ALP members who have held the seat: Harry Webb, Dr Ron Edwards and Jann McFarlane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The early 1970s were a particularly exciting time for Stirling division, with a strong team, including Jim Clarko as president. Bob Pike led doorknocking on the weekends to drive voter membership, with $10 a couple for membership being quite a bargain, if you ask me. In 1972 divisional members donated $100 each to purchase the division's first property—a modest little house, but great for meetings and campaigning. One member even went to live in the back of the house to help with costs and maintenance—what dedication!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1974, at the double dissolution election, the Labor Party desperately wanted the seat back, and, at the close of counting, Ian Viner trailed Labor's Graham Reece by 700 votes. But, when preferences were counted, the provisional result was a tie, so scrutineers were assembled and, after a long day's counting the next day, more Liberal votes were found and Ian Viner scraped in by just 12 votes. Fast forward to 1984 and a redistribution saw Stirling incorporate more northern suburbs, including suburbs like Balga, Westminster and Mirrabooka, bringing a great deal of wonderful, diverse community groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004, my predecessor, Michael Keenan, won the seat back from Labor. Michael was a fantastic local member, serving with distinction for 15 years. It was an honour to be able to continue his excellent work in our community. Stirling has been so well served as well by passionate divisional members. And, though there are many stalwarts, please forgive me for only mentioning recent divisional presidents by name: Rob Paparde, Karlo Perkov, Chris Hatton, Tony Krsticevic, Troy Pickard and Melinda Poor.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always had a passion for serving others, and I bore this out first by joining the Army straight out of school. Serving as a commander on military operations overseas will remain one of my life's highlights. In 2019, when I was elected to parliament, I made a commitment to serve in a different way by relentlessly supporting my local community. Since then, I've gotten to know so many local families, businesses and community groups. I'm incredibly proud of what we've achieved so far together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our area is one of the most multicultural in Australia. Whether it be the Vietnamese, the Burmese, the Italians, the Africans or the Indian communities—I could go on—it's a privilege to be your local representative in parliament. It's groups like these for whom I continue to fight. For example, in 2019 Michael Keenan introduced me to a wonderful local community leader, Fatima, who is the operations services manager at Mirrabooka Mosque. Fatima works tirelessly supporting attendees to the mosque and the wider community, who the mosque actively welcomes in. However, in 2018 the mosque was the victim of a firebombing attack, which badly damaged the building. Since then, I've fought to achieve funding for two rounds of security upgrades, including CCTV security cameras and lighting, because everybody deserves to feel safe and accepted in our community. But, after the firebombing, it was actually the spirit of resilience that I saw in our community, as it rallied to support the mosque and condemn violence, that was so heartening.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, roughly the eastern half of Stirling and the southern half of old Cowan are being smashed together in the new seat of Cowan. As the Liberal candidate for new Cowan, I am continuing to fight to serve my local community. I'm seeking re-election because, despite all of the good that we have achieved together, there is still much to be done in support of local families, businesses and community groups. I'm still filled with the passion and the energy to be the torchbearer of democracy in Cowan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I rise today on behalf of the Bombala community, who are in desperate need of a solution and are sick of the rhetoric of this government. In February I asked the Prime Minister to take action to support Bombala after the community was told that their beloved aged-care facility, Currawarna, would close. As I stood in parliament, residents, staff and family members were in shock. They had no idea what the next steps would be. They've looked to the government for support, but they've been ignored. In last night's budget there was not a single thing for the aged-care sector: nothing to deal with staff shortages, nothing for aged-care transparency and nothing for Bombala. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Health and Aged Care has stood in question time and denied that there was a crisis in regional aged care. He said the government had intervened to support residents, but all the government had done was tell the provider to stay open until the residents found somewhere else to go. Residents will be forced out of their homes. They had made the decision to age with dignity in a community that respected them, that remembered their best days and that would stand with them and provide comfort for them when they were in their worst days. There is no dignity, respect or choice in what has happened to these residents. Their families are doing their best to find new homes for them, but it won't be the same. Daily visits from loved ones will be a thing of the past, as the 200-kilometre round trip to the nearest aged-care facility will make this impossible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago I travelled to Bombala to attend a community meeting to discuss the future of aged care in the region. Around 100 locals gathered to ask the question: 'What now?' What could they do to ensure this doesn't mean the end of aged care in their town? The devastation in the room was palpable, but the commitment from the community to do everything it can was inspiring. I was there, the local mayor was there, the state representative was there. Politics aside, this issue needs to be addressed. Despite the three requests I've made to the aged-care minister to visit Bombala, he did not attend. The minister for health said aged-care centres have opened and that more have opened than have closed over the past five years. But how many of these new centres have opened in regional areas? Currawarna is the second aged-care centre in Eden-Monaro to close in the last few months alone, and I'm not aware of a single one opening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>I have no doubt that this will keep happening, and regional communities will continue to be left behind. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a document here and I seek to table it now. It contains a petition of the Bombala community, with 937 signatures and 242 letters written by community members urging the government to secure the future of aged care in Bombala. This shows how important the aged-care system is in Bombala. I'll be taking a copy directly to the minister following this. He may have refused to come to Bombala, but he cannot keep ignoring this community. The government cannot sweep aged care under the rug. Regional Australians deserve to be able to age with dignity in communities they know and love. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In recent months I've visited Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury, which is based in Gordon in my electorate, on two occasions and I've visited them many times over my time as the local member. I'm very pleased that, since 2016, Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury has received over $61,000 in funding towards the centre at Gordon through various federal government grants, particularly Stronger Communities and volunteer grants. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last weekend I joined the Prime Minister at the centre, where the Prime Minister announced an additional $52.3 million in funding for Lifeline Australia as part of the 2022 federal budget. This funding will go to support the outstanding crisis support services that Lifeline offers Australians, as it has done for the past 60 years. When combined with the support the Morrison government is already providing to Lifeline, this brings total crisis services support provided by the Morrison government to $114.2 million over the next four years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this visit, and on previous visits to the centre, I had the opportunity to meet a number of the dedicated staff and volunteers and to learn more about the great work that they do. This work includes suicide prevention services with a focus on helping pull Australians who may be thinking of suicide away from the edge when they're facing really tough times. I learned about the help services they provide for Australians who are struggling with gambling and the financial distress that can result for people who become addicted to gambling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to express my thanks to those who were at the event on Saturday, including Wendy Carver, the CEO of Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury, Mr John Brogden, the patron of Lifeline Australia, Mr Colin Seery, the Chief Executive of Lifeline Australia, Ms Angela Dodd, the Chief Financial Officer of Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury, Ms Julie Wicks, the Chief Operating Officer, and Caroline McGrory, the supervisor of the call centre at Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury. In particular, I also want to acknowledge all of the dedicated volunteers at Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury. Those I met on recent visits included Ms Michelle McCallum, Mr Dominic Broden and Ms Brenda Barber, and I've met a number over the years. I particularly want to acknowledge my constituents in Bradfield who volunteer at Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to all Australians: if you are in need, if you need to talk to somebody, if you're struggling, call Lifeline on 131114.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Alier Chol Riak was just 23 years old when he was stabbed to death on 13 March in the Melbourne Docklands. He was out celebrating his 23rd birthday with his older brother when they were set upon, and, in an unprovoked attack, he was stabbed by a group of men who ambushed them. On Saturday, I attended Alier's memorial service and funeral at St Paul's Anglican Church in Mirrabooka. It's always sad when we say goodbye to somebody who is taken from us so young. But I believe that Alier Riak deserves to be mentioned in this place because he was a remarkable young man who, in his short life, achieved some very remarkable things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alier was born in a Kenyan refugee camp. His family was South Sudanese. They came to Australia in 2005. Alier attended John Septimus Roe Anglican Community School in my electorate of Cowan and excelled in basketball. He joined the Warwick Senators and played for them. But he also coached for them, and through that role inspired many other young people through sport but also through the kindness and generosity that he extended to them by showing them that there was a positive pathway and a place of belonging for them here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was so good at basketball, the game that he loved, that he earned a basketball scholarship to the United States. I don't know how many people here know that, but it's very, very difficult to earn a sports scholarship to the United States, particularly in basketball. He got that scholarship to Wyoming state university, where he became a much-loved member of their student class and their basketball team. He got a bachelor's degree from the US, from Wyoming state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He returned to Australia and he was recruited to the Darwin Salties, but, sadly, he never got to wear the jersey and he never got to play a game for the Darwin Salties. His life was taken in such tragic circumstances. I'd like to send my condolences to the JSR community, to the Riak family and to all of those who have been touched so deeply by Alier Riak's life. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a marvellous Australian woman who was also a friend and a mentor to me from when I first came into politics, Lorraine Kovacs. Living in Yatala in my electorate, Lorraine was still an active member of the LNP and a volunteer at the age of 80. She loved nothing more than an election campaign: handing out how-to-vote cards, working as a scrutineer and doing all of the other things that come with that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of her most prized possessions was her photo with Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Lorraine was born in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton in 1941 and grew up in Pascoe Vale. Her first job was with the ES&amp;A Bank. A temporary posting to the Victorian country town of Bendigo fortuitously led her to the YMCA dance on a Saturday night, where with she would meet her future husband. The union would last more than half a century. Married in October 1961, Lorraine and her husband settled in Melbourne's eastern suburbs and had three children: Caroline, Rob and Julie. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lorraine always wanted to travel and, following the usual family holidays across Australia, she finally had the chance to spread her wings, visiting destinations such as the South Pacific, Asia, the US, Mexico, Alaska, the UK and Europe. As well as her passion for travel, Lorraine was actively involved in the Scouting movement, where she was an Akela.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lorraine was also a political trailblazer, serving as a councillor for the City of Berwick in Melbourne's outer east from 1986 to 1989, including a term as mayor from 1988 to 1989. As well as her three children, Lorraine became a grandmother to seven grandchildren: Caitlyn, Noah, Jack, Amy, Mollie, Shen-nay and Josh, and loved nothing better than spending time with them and watching them grow. Lorraine's sudden passing was an unexpected shock for all who knew her. Out one day recently, enjoying what she always enjoyed doing—getting her nails done and catching up with friends for lunch—she suffered a fall from which she would never recover. My condolences to Lorraine's children, Caroline, Rob and Julie, and to her many grandchildren and friends. My staff, my wife, Judi, and I will miss Lorraine's enthusiasm, passion and commitment to me and my team over many campaigns. More importantly, it's a loss—sadly felt—for our community and her family. May she rest in peace. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  This may be my last chance to speak in this place before the election. I never take for granted the privilege of speaking out to give voice to the dreams, achievements and struggles of my constituents. I've stood up time and time again to make sure that Indi gets the best outcome. Standing up for Indi isn't just about being loud; it's about understanding, deep in my bones, what matters to our community and what we need. I've worked with government when they were on the right track and called them out when they've got it wrong. As an Independent, I'm focused on what's right for us, not what's right for the party. By representing Indi, the issues that matter to us have remained on the national stage, even when this government wanted to forget them. I've been a fearless champion for community renewable energy, and we've secured over $7 million for local projects. I've worked constructively with the energy minister. We will have a hydrogen plant in Wodonga, one of the first of its kind. My electorate is fast becoming a renewable energy powerhouse, and everyday people are already seeing real benefits from this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In mental health, I've worked with the outgoing health minister to secure funding for ongoing mental health workers to support the Upper Murray community after the devastating bushfires. Without our efforts together over many months, the community would not have this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the border closure, looking back, it feels like a bad hallucination. It's hard to believe that our community was torn in two for months. I worked to allow doctors to cross the border to work at Northeast Health Wangaratta. We fought to get midwives and maternal and child health nurses across the border. As an Independent MP, I could stand up to push the governments on all sides to come good for the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there's the integrity commission—a broken Morrison government election promise. It has not been forgotten. I hear from my constituents, again and again, on street corners and even at the local footy club: 'Keep going. Don't give up! What you are pushing for is what we need to see.' And I can assure you, I will never give up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Picture this: a thriving, regional community, with a strong, local economy, better health care, reliable phone and internet coverage and better rail services, where young people find jobs and homes and older people are cared for. This is what regional Australians want for their communities and this is what I want for Indi, and I will never stop fighting for it. If we're ever going to achieve this vision, the time is now and this is the moment. As we look to rebuild after a turbulent two years, the need for Independent representation has never been stronger. We can't go backwards. We've seen what happens when an incumbent takes their community for granted, and I will never do that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  It is always interesting: these three-minute statements are usually about what our community has been doing—and today I would like to rise to share some cheer during this torrid time in Australia's history—but when the Climate 200 candidates come into this chamber they always seem to end up talking about themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Mackellar, however, there is a jewel of a woman—the Northern Beaches' own version of the charming and charismatic Auntie Mame. Faye Byrne is 80 years young. She has won our hearts with her warmth, generosity, insights, positivity, good cheer and sparkle. If we could bottle her energy, we could solve numerous global challenges right now. Faye has lived life fully and created so many memories and anecdotes that I could wax lyrical for far longer than the allotted time. This dynamo of a woman believes a good life is one of kindness, sharing and giving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Faye has always helped those who are less fortunate. In 1980, the Byrne family set up the Leo &amp; Jenny Leukemia and Cancer Foundation to honour Jenny and Leo, loved ones they had lost to leukaemia. Faye was instrumental in raising millions of dollars, which morphed into Sail for Cancer and Ride for Cancer, and, in 2002, the foundation was officially renamed Cure Cancer. For 25 years, Faye was relentless, raising funds while simultaneously bringing up her four children and working in her husband Bob's business. Whilst heavily pregnant, Faye was the licensee of Bronte Charles Hotel and also worked at the Artarmon inn in Sydney with Bob. She also, some 54 years ago, held a real estate licence, which at the time was extremely difficult to obtain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Faye has supported the Variety Club over the years and undertook two bashes with her brother Ron in 1997 and 1998 and had enormous fun in the process. Since that time, she's been offering her ongoing support by attending Variety Club fundraisers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her relentless energy and spirit have served her beloved Liberal Party well for the past 35 years. Faye has been a loyal member of the Beacon Hill and Newport branches and has brought a steely determination to assist the party in any way possible—not because she wanted to help the Liberal Party but because she wanted her community to be even better. Her commitment and loyalty to her community and the values which she believes the Liberal Party stands for are beyond reproach. Faye's love of life—her joie de vivre—has been evident from the outset. Faye believes that life should be embraced, that travel and learning should be pursued and certainly that one should laugh often and much. Her family sustains Faye and she sustains them. Faye deserves accolades from afar, not only because of her passion for life but for her caring and kindness. We should all, I believe, take a leaf from Faye's book. I'm proud to call Faye and Bob Byrne friends.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  Six weeks ago, I stood here in the chamber and predicted that the vast majority of aged-care workers would never receive the Prime Minister's $400 bonus payment, and I was right. Most workers have not received the bonus, and they're wondering why. They feel frustrated and let down by a government that has completely abandoned them and the vulnerable aged-care residents they care for. What these workers need is a permanent pay rise, not a pathetic one-off payment that most won't even get because they work on a casual or part-time basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in this budget, aged-care workers have received another slap in the face. They've been overlooked yet again in a budget which completely fails to address the problems in aged care. One of the biggest problems is low wages. The other is staff-to-resident ratios. The royal commission into aged care called for higher wages and more time for staff to spend with those they're caring for. Aged-care workers do some of the most important and compassionate work in our communities, and yet they get paid $21 an hour. That's less than someone who stacks shelves in a supermarket. This must change if we are to attract and retain skilled aged-care workers in the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, so many families are affected by the crisis in aged care. Donna is a personal care attendant in a local aged-care facility. She spoke passionately at a recent forum I held in Armstrong Creek. Donna spoke about low wages, insecure work and the frustration of being unable to properly care for frail and elderly residents. These are her words: 'I love my job. I wanted to make lives better, but now we're facing a roadblock. We've got six minutes to put each resident to bed each night.' Donna's hourly rate has increased by only $7 in the 11 years she has been employed in the aged-care sector. She earns $21 per hour. This is a disgrace. She said that more staff are desperately needed to improve resident-worker ratios. Currently, in the high-level care unit she works in, there is only one staff member to every 12 residents. This makes it extremely difficult for Donna to change a soiled continence pad, give medicine and carefully wash a frail resident before bedtime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government are refusing to do anything to help Donna and Australia's aged-care workers. They refuse to implement the aged-care recommendations, and it is all our elderly relatives and loved ones who are suffering. This is unacceptable. Low wages, a casualised workforce and low staff-to-resident ratios have all led to a system buckling under intense pressure. It's time for a government that will care about our aged-care workers and our most vulnerable citizens and their families. It's time for an Albanese Labor government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I'm pleased to provide the House with an update on two substantial federal funding commitments in the areas of health and education which will directly benefit all Western Australians and, in particular, my constituents in Moore. In October last year, I rose to make a strong merit based case for a significant federal funding contribution towards the development of a comprehensive cancer care centre in Western Australia. In the months following, members of the Western Australian parliamentary Liberal team worked diligently behind the scenes to secure the necessary funding to make this project a reality. I'm pleased to inform the House that, on Sunday, the Prime Minister visited Perth to announce that $375 million in federal funding has been committed to enable the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research to deliver a comprehensive cancer care centre in Perth. This will benefit the estimated 55,000 of my fellow Western Australians battling cancer, including many living in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits of having a comprehensive cancer centre based in Perth include improved patient survival and quality of life through improved access to the latest drugs via clinical trials. Total cancer care will be provided in one convenient place, including diagnosis and treatment, imaging, pathology, surgery, radiotherapy, oncology, haematology, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, exercise and wellness treatments. The facility will also foster world-class translational research that attracts the best clinicians and researchers from across the world. I thank the Prime Minister for listening and responding to the needs of Western Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, more than two years ago, I informed the House of the vision by Professor Steve Chapman, Vice-Chancellor of Edith Cowan University, based in my electorate, to establish a new gateway campus specialising in creative industries, business and technology courses. The satellite campus will be based in Perth's central business district and house the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts. Following strong advocacy by WA Liberal team members and senators, the Morrison government initially announced $245 million in federal funding for the project. However, cost escalations have necessitated an increase in funding. I'm pleased to inform the House that the Prime Minister visited Perth earlier this month and committed a further $49 million in funding, bringing the total federal funding contribution to $295 million.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  My electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland has the largest veteran population in the region. It's home to 5,500 veterans and the largest Air Force base in the country. Two weeks ago the member for Gorton, the shadow minister for defence, and the member for Oxley and I announced that an Albanese Labor government would commit $5 million for a new veterans club in the Ipswich-Springfield area. Labor announced this positive initiative after the coalition made a commitment to do so in 2016 and reneged on that promise. And in 2019 they deliberately left out the Ipswich area in their election commitment to wellbeing hubs. Labor has a plan not just to do this but to fix the Department of Veterans' Affairs, rebuild the Public Service and give our veterans and their families the services they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the weekend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs attacked his government. He admitted that the coalition government had failed Australian veterans. He admitted that ex-service men and women have been waiting for years for compensation to be processed by our chronically understaffed and underresourced Department of Veterans' Affairs. There's a huge backlog of about 60,000 claims, which the minister described as 'a national disgrace'. He threatened to resign on the eve of the budget if he didn't lock in $96 million in extra funding for an extra 145 staff and IT upgrades in his department to clear the backlog by the middle of next year. The Prime Minister threw him under the bus by saying he was a new minister and had no idea what he was talking about, and suggested that there would be further funding in the contingency reserve down the track. Some of the minister's own National Party colleagues lined up in the media to slam him, saying he was grandstanding and using veterans as a political play thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I asked the minister about this issue in question time yesterday, he doubled down on the comments he had made on the weekend. Lo and behold, when the budget was released last night, it revealed that only $22.8 million had been allocated for 90 new staff. So the minister has clearly failed his own test to lock in the funding he said he needed to reduce the backlog. He should follow through on his threat over the weekend and resign his commission today. The $22 million committed in the budget looked a bit like the short-term fix we saw in the last budget: it's really about getting through the election and not fixing the problems in the department.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the government trumpeted a budget boost for DVA that turned out to be a cruel hoax because the additional funding and the jobs lasted for two years only. Clearly, they had no effect on claim times. In the last 12 months, claim times have blown out to two years. That's the evidence that was given to a Senate inquiry and to the royal commission. The number of claims has increased from 55,000 to 60,000. Minister, do your job, carry through with your threat and resign today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistan</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">t Minister for Youth and Employment Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  Last night's budget goes a long way to helping businesses and Australian workers. It does a number of things. It extends the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements scheme to a future workforce so that can be secured. It gives apprentices $5,000 to help them in their first and second years, when their wages are lower, and gives $15,000 to the employers who are putting them on. It extends the instant asset write-off, which is really important to help businesses with their cash flow as they hire more people. And it helps with the cost of living, with a reduction of 22 cents a litre in the fuel excise to kick in immediately. That will help people as they fill up their petrol tank each week. There's medicines relief for 2.4 million people. There's $1.3 billion for women's safety, which is really important in helping to stop domestic violence. Single parents will now be able to access up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave under the Paid Parental Leave scheme. There's record investment in defence. There's a $420 tax offset to help 10 million Australians and a $250 payment to help six million Australians. It's a good budget and I want to congratulate the Treasurer. I think it will help a lot of people in Petrie.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last term we've been able to do a lot of things in Petrie. I always take it as an honour to be able to represent the people of Petrie. There are a few local things we've done: we've upgraded the Redcliffe Coast Guard and the Redcliffe Peninsula Surf Life Saving Club; we've got a new Medicare funded MRI machine at Redcliffe Hospital, and we've upgraded the intensive care unit; we've improved the lighting at the North Lakes Eels AFL; we've done the Gigum Hall at Mango Hill State School, which is Queensland's largest school in prep to year 6; we've done a brand-new community hall at Deception Bay; we've put in a new marquee at the Aspley bowls club; and we've improved the roads in Bracken Ridge at Hoyland Street and Norris Road at Barbour Road as well, which is brilliant. There's a lot to be done and there's more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got record road funding that we announced several years ago, with $800 million for the Gateway Motorway, $120 million for Linkfield Road, $120 million for the on and off ramps at Griffin and Murrumba Downs. But, unfortunately, all these funding commitments are reliant on the state Labor government to build them. I wrote to the Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Mark Bailey, last year, asking to bring forward Linkfield Road, but he refused to act. They're not starting that until early 2023, for a 2024 completion, just in time for the next state election. I'll continue to advocate for the state government to start that sooner for the local people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Canning</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Assistant Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I rise today to honour the memory of the late Kimberley Kitching, Labor senator for Victoria. She was my friend, and I shall miss her, as will many people in this place. The first time that I met Kimberley was on a plane from Canberra to Melbourne in late 2016. My wife, Ruth, and my baby son, Jonathan, were with me, spread out across a row of seats. We were tired, still new to politics and bracing for the long journey back to Perth. In front of us, a beaming smile came up over the seat. It was paired with a soft giggle. A hello and introduction followed. It was Kimberley Kitching. Kimberley Kitching! I was confused. She was meant to be a tough, ruthless Labor factional warrior if you read the press and believed it, and here she was making friends with me and my family. But that was Kimba, as we called her: curious, warm, engaging and reaching out to people across the aisle or to the passenger in the seat behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things I could say about Kimberley today, and much has already been said and written about the way she was treated by people in this place and the pressures she was feeling prior to her sudden passing. I don't intend to spend much time discussing that today. I want to focus on two of her qualities: her patriotism and her strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley was a patriot. She loved Australia and our people. But she was also a well-travelled lady. She had seen and known much of the world through her own eyes: foreign cities, cultures, climates, parliaments and governments. That experience expressed itself in different ways, from her love of French culture to her European greeting down at Aussies—the kiss on the cheek—which is still the most counterintuitive way to greet an opposition member in this place. She was cosmopolitan, yet she believed that Australia was exceptional—a great nation that had risen to the many challenges it had faced over history. Kimberley argued in her maiden speech that Australia is exceptional not because of a divine mandate or inherent qualities but because generations of Australians before us have made hard choices and hard sacrifices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Individual agency was a real thing to her. People are faced with decisions every day. Dialectical and historical materialism, advocated by Karl Marx, was not her cup of tea. People have choices in life, and she believed that people built this country—our Westminster system, our institutions, our prosperity—by making the tough decisions in life. And she came to this place to continue that work as a patriot, and that was the basis of our political collaboration, alongside fellow Wolverines such as my good friend Senator James Paterson. We believed that we have a country worth defending, a democracy worth preserving and institutions worth protecting. We had differences of opinion on how that might happen, as you'd expect, given our political differences and choices, but together we started with the premise that the Commonwealth of Australia must be sovereign—it must be territorially sovereign; it must be politically sovereign; it must be economically sovereign; it must be digitally sovereign; and, most importantly, the parliament itself must be sovereign: free from foreign interference. That was our starting point, and that gave the Wolverines a big enough tent to work together on the toughest challenges over the past few years, whether it was tackling foreign interference or economic coercion, or pushing for the adoption of a Magnitsky act. This partnership yielded results, and it's a reminder to me that the best politics will always involve principle, compromise and consensus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Wolverine, Kimberley took more personal political risk than us, and she did so because she loved Australia and knew that working together would benefit our Commonwealth. She took the hard choice and made the hard sacrifice because she believed it was the right thing for Australia. It's hard to reach out across the aisle, given the state of modern politics. It's not easy. So today I honour her for that in this chamber. The hard choices Kimberley made in this place, though, remind us that she was a strong woman. She was warm, she was friendly, she was thoughtful, she was kind—yes, all those things and more—but make no mistake: she was tough. She had a toughness fit for senior ministerial office. Politics is a contest, and she enjoyed the delight of political battle in this place. It takes strength to follow your convictions, to fight for them and to not take a backward step.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often said to her: 'Kimba, one day you might have to kill me politically. Make sure you do it cleanly!' We were realistic about the limits to our political partnership. Yes, she was under pressure with her preselection. She told me that several times this year, especially after she had named Chau Chak Wing in Senate estimates. But, as I told her at the time: 'If anyone can fight their way out of a corner, Kimberley, it's you. You can prevail.' That's the sort of confidence her inner strength, buttressed by her Catholic faith, inspired in those who worked closely with her. Kimberley would find a way to get the job done. That's why her sudden death was such a blow to us. She had so much life, energy and drive—so much more to give this country. The strategic challenges we face as Australians are not going away, and we are poorer without Senator Kimberley Kitching holding the line in Parliament House. We will miss her smile and we will miss her courage, but we will take inspiration from her example, 'strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield'. Rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I rise to give thanks for and acknowledge the life of Senator Kimberley Jane Elizabeth Kitching. In doing so, I want to place on record my deep sympathies to her husband, Andrew Landeryou; her parents, Bill and Leigh Kitching; and her brother, Ben, who was in my year at high school, and we graduated together in year 12. I knew Kimberley probably longer than most people in this parliament. I want to reflect on the words of the member for Canning, who spoke about Kimberley's wonderful attributes, her values. I want to reflect today about her personal life and her amazing sense of joy and fun, her joie de vivre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Kimberley at university. We were particularly close around 30 years ago. I can remember exactly where we were standing at the University of Queensland refectory, which was where most political wheeling and dealing was done at the time. Kimberley was running for president of the student union, and I was, I guess, the campaign director for the Labor Right ticket. I wasn't particularly successful at university, but I've made up for it in lost time. Senator Murray Watt and Senator Jenny McAllister were running on the broad Left ticket, I guess. It has been said already that the right-wing candidate, or the Young Liberal candidate, for president was the member for Fairfax, Ted O'Brien. From that one political intervention you're seeing the careers of many, many people come to life. I remember signing Kimberley's ALP nomination form when she joined the Labor Party in Queensland, and that she was happy about joining a political party that would affect her life and affect the lives of many of us going forward. At university there was no-one who was more connected into political life on campus, whether it was through the UQLS, the University of Queensland Law Society; the revues that she starred in; or the amazing connections she had through so many different cultural and social groups at university. It's not surprising, when we celebrated her life a couple of weeks ago at St Patrick's, that the whole place was full of connections that she'd made right throughout her life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin my remarks by reflecting on what an amazing connector Kimberley was in bringing people together. From those humble beginnings, for her political life and her commitment to public service we know that she then left Queensland, and Queensland's loss was Victoria's gain. We then shared a number of intersections in our lives, and I always say that she was a part of my life for 30 years. We both ended up serving in local government as councillors: Kimberley was on the Melbourne City Council and I was on the Brisbane City Council. Her amazing ability to connect and to bring people together as a Melbourne city councillor and bring together those forces and work together across those multiparty and multifactional situations probably stood her in very good stead to enter the national stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a unionist, through her work in advocating for some of the low-paid workers in this country, and through her fierce advocacy to make sure that no-one was left behind, particularly in feminine industries—those industries that desperately needed representation—she was always a proud servant who made sure the little people were never left behind, and that was true of her entire life. Obviously, then with her entering the Senate, we reconnected, and I was so pleased and full of joy when she achieved her goal of recognition from the people of Victoria in serving in the Senate for the last five years. I've said before to a number of our mutual friends, particularly some of her deep, longstanding Queensland friends, that Kimberley was like a good, beautiful glass of champagne—it would have to be French champagne, of course! She was full of effervescence, full of bubbles, full of life, and you really wanted that glass of champagne to be continually filled up. You didn't want it to end; you always wanted to have one more taste. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Canning said that she would always greet people with a kiss, and I counted four occasions in one day that she greeted me with a kiss! Some might think that's too much or a bit over the top. But now I think all of us who knew and loved Kimberley would do anything for one more kiss, one more greeting, because, whenever you saw her, her face would be lit up and you would light up as well. She was infectious in terms of her impact in talking to people and meeting people. She had that sense of fun, and that sense of joy—there may have been things going on behind in the background; there may have been things that she carried that many of us didn't see, but her close confidants knew—was contagious. With anyone you met, she would make you feel like you were the most important, precious person in the world, and very few people can do that—very few people can do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge all of her friends who are grieving, particularly her close, close friends in Victoria. She and Andrew have an amazing sense of kinship and friendship. When you became friends with Kimberley and Andrew, you had friends for life. That loyalty is not questioned. People like Bill and Chloe Shorten—and we've spoken about this in the parliament and obviously at her service—I know continue to grieve and will always grieve. The impact, the kindness, the beautiful stories we heard about the member for Canning's children, the attention to detail—I would always call Kimberley one of the one percenters for all the things she would remember; the anecdotes, all of those things, go to the rich tapestry of her life. And I do single out Bill and Chloe, who were probably two of her closest friends, and the amazing bond that she had with their children as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue, besides the joie de vivre of Kimberley Kitching, I want to focus on was her amazing insight into travel, and this sums up a lot about Kimberley. I was privileged to be travelling with her on a number of delegations—and the Leader of the Opposition spoke about our trip to Taiwan, meeting with the President of Taiwan and the foreign minister, all in a day's stride. I was in that delegation, hiding at the back, worried about an international incident that I would cause, trying to lay low. It's hard for me to blend into a crowd, but I was trying to fit in. Kimberley's leading from the front, like she's known these people, and it was such a joy to see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other travels we did were to a war zone, and I'd always say, 'If you need to go into a war zone, always travel with Kimberley Kitching.' Travelling to Iraq on the parliamentary ADF trip with the member for Fisher and now Speaker, Andrew Wallace, was probably one of the best things I've done in my life. In giving acknowledgment and recognition to the men and women of the ADF, and, while obviously not from an ADF background, understanding the challenges of the Middle East, once again Kimberley shone in that forum. I pay tribute to the member for Fisher, who has been, I know, deeply upset about the loss of his friend. But we will always have those memories that we shared together on those trips as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot's been said about her passion, her vision and her patriotism, but I wanted to reflect on my friend and the person that had meant so much to me for the last 30 years of my life. I will deeply miss her as a confidante and as someone who I shared a number of years of friendship and camaraderie with, and I will deeply miss her for the rest of my life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Goldstein</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Assistant Minister to the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  My remarks reflecting on this tragedy will be brief only because reflections on a friendship of nearly 20 years with the late Senator Kimberley Kitching are always poor cousins to those with family or partisan relationships. The many times we spent abroad could draw comment, but Instagram captures the sharing of pomegranate juice, the visiting of refugee camps to ensure children are getting an education or the finding of a ceramic bowl from Jerusalem's Armenian Quarter better than I could articulate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a friend for so long, it remains an oddity that some of the least time that Kimberley and I spent together was when we were in this place, merely separated by corridors and a reflective pool. Like many who serve in the federal parliament, we park our relationships for our work, and it's also a reminder to all of us that sometimes we need to pause and remember that there may not be a tomorrow. I won't remark on the many allegations of the behaviour of others preceding her passing, beyond observing that, sadly, many of them rang true from our conversations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley was an extraordinary person and somebody I had the enormous privilege to know for a very long period of time. There were many times when her bright eyes and intoxicating conversation could constitute its own champagne, exactly as was remarked by previous members. This was only to be followed, as her eyes narrowed, with a sudden directness in her lips and questions that demanded a sober and substantive response. That was the wonderful yin and yang of Kimberley's personality. She had the depth of her substance coupled with the breakthrough effervescence of her laughter. It was balanced with a beaming glamour that she always brought to the room, and with the piercing directness of her blue eyes that could bring you to heel. The truth is: I never wanted to be her enemy, and thankfully never was. But to those who always stood by her and were her friends, she gave the most incredible loyalty, and I respect that immensely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his eulogy, the member for Maribyrnong ensured Labor laid claim to Kimberley's legacy, lest some on the Left, perhaps, may not choose to do so. And there are some, on both sides, who probably feel sometimes that Kimberley could have found her home in our party room. Just for clarity, I don't agree with that—even though she once handed out a how-to-vote card that argued in favour of voting for me!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With reluctance, I do disagree with the proposition she was anything other than Labor. She stood out because she was the best of Labor. As her husband, Andrew, said in his eulogy:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She exemplified the courage and creativity that we all say we want from candidates for public office but on all sides we too often shun both, favouring useful idiots, obedient nudniks and bland time-servers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would add that Kimberley's courage and conviction didn't exist except for the fact that she had core belief. And this, of course, is the Kimberley that I knew in all her complexity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's standard in the Venn diagram of the political landscape that the overlap is the centre between ideological extremes, whereas Kimberley was at the centre of a different plane, where the overlap was those who understood public service meant putting Australia first. It's fitting that the Prime Minister announced the first Magnitsky sanctions. The House, in tribute to her legacy, is a reflection of her contribution to these important laws, but it's also a reminder that her legacy lives and will continue to endure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So to her parents, Leigh and Bill; her devoted husband, Andrew; and her loyal dog, Nancy-Jane, who will wait by the door for many days yet: our hearts and our love go to you. When a house loses a parliamentarian, we salve the loss through soothing speeches. When a party loses a warrior, that torch of liberty or light on the hill can perhaps flicker a little less brightly. But when a nation loses a rare patriot, the loss is to our collective moral courage. And that is the loss we share with Kimberley's passing. May she rest in peace. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  While I've enjoyed listening to the contributions of the member for Goldstein, the member for Canning and the member for Oxley about Kimberley Kitching's life today, I must say that it is a grim duty for members of this parliament to speak on this motion before the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sudden death of Kimberley Kitching at just 52 years of age is a profound human tragedy. Those of us in this building are still feeling the shock keenly, less than a month after the terrible news, and those of us who knew her, from across the political spectrum, are in mourning at this terrible human loss. While Kimberley was a public figure and is being mourned publicly, amidst the media coverage and the controversy we cannot lose sight of the personal tragedy being experienced by everyone who knew Kimberley. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thoughts, first, are with her partner, Andrew, who spoke so powerfully at her funeral. I don't know how he managed it. I can't imagine the pain that he's experiencing, and I know that I would not have been able to speak so movingly. My thoughts are, similarly, with her parents, Bill and Leigh, and her brother, Ben, who are so obviously deeply proud of everything that she had achieved, as well as having deeply loved her as a daughter and sister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thoughts are also with that unique form of political family, Senator Kitching's staff. I have spoken before in this House about the uniquely intimate relationship between staff and members and senators in this building. It's a close bond. I have experienced the death of a much-loved staff member, and I know that my office experienced that as the loss of a family member. And I know that Kimberley's staff will be experiencing this keen loss too at the moment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of us in this building, Kimberley wasn't the caricature that you sometimes read about in media representations. We knew Kimberley as a person, as a human being, with all of the complexity of human relationships that that entails. She loved poetry, and, to paraphrase Walt Whitman, she 'contained multitudes'. It is fair to say that Kimberley and I had a complex relationship at times. We ran against each other for preselection and later became parliamentary colleagues fighting for the same cause. That makes for the kind of relationship that is unique in politics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics is inherently a contest of both people and ideas. What those outside of politics sometimes don't understand, though, is that sometimes this contest occurs between people trying to achieve the same ultimate outcome. Along the years, Kimberley and I sometimes had different views on preliminary tactics. While we were at times political rivals, always underlying this was the fact that I fundamentally agreed with her on the big issues. In politics you can judge people by the fights they get into. I was reflecting on the member for Oxley's contribution about travelling with Kimberley on a delegation and not wanting to cause an international incident. I can report to the House that I travelled on a delegation with Kimberley Kitching; the now member for Goldstein; and the former Speaker, Bronwyn Bishop, where we did cause an international incident! I won't detain the House by going over the details of that again. But it was a constant risk when travelling with Kimberley, because she got into the fights that mattered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the history of this period is written, it will show that Kimberley was in all of the most important political fights of our generation. In this way, the times suited her. I have spoken many times in this chamber about the moment that we live in and the need for the current generation of political leaders to champion democratic values and freedom in the face of a rising authoritarian threat both abroad and at home. The democracy needed a new generation of advocates—like Kennedy and Reagan in the US, and Curtin and Chifley in Australia. Kimberley was a fierce champion of freedom and democratic values. She understood that the sacred mission of Labor politics throughout the 20th century endured into the present, and that is that we fight fascists. She understood that democracy isn't just a worthy ideal; it is the foundation of the material wellbeing of the working people that we seek to represent. She understood, too, that those who would deny freedom and democracy at home and abroad must be confronted by the labour movement and by the Australian Labor Party as its political standard-bearer in this country. Kimberley didn't just champion freedom and democracy as ideas; she wasn't interested in being part of a debating society; she championed causes to deliver outcomes in the real world. And you could see the living embodiment of these fights in the people who attended her funeral—Tibetans, Uighurs, Hong Kong democracy activists, Chinese dissidents, human rights campaigners and Afghan refugees. They were a living legacy of her advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously spoken in this chamber about Kimberley's role in delivering an Australian Magnitsky sanctions regime. She was an advocate for the cause long before it was claimed by both sides of politics. Over the years I attended many meetings for this cause that she arranged with the movement's founder, Bill Browder, and other advocates. She first won over the Labor caucus and the shadow ministry to the cause and maintained the pressure on the government to act through a private member's bill. She then gave the government an on-ramp to get onboard the cause through a parliamentary inquiry which allowed a bipartisan consensus to emerge among the committee members. Now Australia has legislated its own Magnitsky sanctions regime, and this week we imposed our first sanctions on a collection of figures associated with that thuggish Putin autocracy and its repulsive, illegal invasion of Ukraine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley's work to make a Magnitsky sanctions regime a reality in Australia was a worthy legacy that has never been more timely and important. It was an achievement that led to her being awarded that Sergei Magnitsky Human Rights Award in 2001, which has been won by figures like John McCain and Alexei Navalny. But we should understand that this was an award born of Kimberley's political skills. If nothing else, we should honour Kimberley's legacy by remembering her as a political warrior, because it was those political skills that enabled her to achieve her Magnitsky legacy in this parliament. She wasn't a protester; she wasn't an opinion columnist; she was someone who sought to make change through politics. It's the noble cause that leads us all to this parliament. She was someone who got into the arena and fought for things and for the people she believed in. And none of this was easy. It required courage and endurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley's husband, Andrew, couldn't have summed it up better than when he quoted from William Ernest Henley's 'Invictus' at her funeral service:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the fell clutch of circumstance</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   I have not winced nor cried aloud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Under the bludgeonings of chance</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">   My head is bloody, but unbowed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People like Kimberley do not go into politics because it is easy or because it is glorious; they go into politics and endure the contest because of what can be achieved when the contest is won. Kimberley Kitching had an impact during her brief time in this place and will leave a lasting legacy. She will encourage a current generation of political leadership, and the future generations of political leadership that follow, to be full-throated in their defence of freedom and democracy in the face of the rising authoritarian threat that our generation now confronts. She leaves this parliament bloodied but unbowed.</span>

To those who have previously contributed to this motion, I also commend them for their frankness and their raw emotion. Kimberley Kitching was a very, very special person. I can well recall, not that long ago, when I was the Deputy Prime Minister, coming back from doing the morning media and Kimberley went to pass me in the corridor, stopped, propped, lent forward, gave me a peck on the cheek, and went into one of the media studios and rubbished the government. Then, later on, we bumped into one another at Aussies and she said, 'Did you see what I said about your government?' I said, 'Yes, Kimberley.' She said, 'No personal offence.' I said, 'None taken.' That was the sort of person she was. I don't think any other Labor member has ever caught me in the corridor and given me a peck on the cheek. That's the sort of vivacious person she was. She was a beautiful person.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I saw on social media that night about her death, I remarked to my wife, Catherine, 'Kimberley Kitching has passed away.' My wife said: 'She was always smiling. She was always happy.' We messaged our daughter, Georgina, who is a schoolteacher in Melbourne. Georgina and Kimberley had some good moments together at various events in Melbourne, not least the Melbourne Cup. Georgina was very moved. If you go down the streets of any country town or, indeed, urban area in Australia and ask people the names of three upper house members of parliament, they'd be, quite frankly—and I mean this with all due respect—hard pressed to name three upper house members unless they are ministers or prominent members of parliament. But a lot of people knew Kimberley Kitching. They knew her for her human rights advocacy. They knew her, as the member for Gellibrand has just very accurately summed up and articulately said, for her passion as a political warrior for the right causes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to a function in Wagga Wagga recently to celebrate the Tibetans of our town, and Kimberley's name came up. That was something which really struck me. She had so much of an effect—and a good effect—on so many people. She was taken at the age of 52. Only the good die young. With all due respect, Deputy Speaker Dick, you and I will be around for quite a while yet. I don't mean to reflect on the chair. I don't! But 52 is way too young. Today we have the state memorial for Shane Warne. This is just so heartbreaking. Our nation has lost two of its finest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley Kitching—chosen by Victoria to represent her state—came into the parliament in October 2016. At the requiem funeral mass held in St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne on 21 March, just over a week ago, Chloe Shorten, a good friend of hers and of many of us, and the wife of the former Leader of the Opposition and current member for Maribyrnong, read from the Book of Proverbs. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reading went on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She opens her mouth with wisdom and on her tongue is the law of kindness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a very appropriate passage of the farewell for Kimberley Kitching, because Kimberley's humour, her personality, her demeanour, her work ethic and her attitude all spoke of the value of this woman to so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's rare that somebody has touched so many across the aisle. I get on, I'd like to think, with most Labor members. You don't realise what good people they are until you go on a committee with them or go on a journey with them as part of the parliamentary process. Kimberley was that next level of special. She truly was. I can well remember going on a delegation on the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ronald Reagan</span>. It was a special trip. It was July 2019, and MPs and senators across the political divide went on that vessel. On the delegation we were joined by Christian Porter, the member for Pearce; Senator Scott Ryan; Mark Dreyfus, the member for Isaacs; Senator Kristina Keneally; and Senator James Paterson. Kimberley was there, and when I looked at the photo the other day she was front and centre—as she always was. She was there. She was joining the dots between the various political machinations and factions, and she was there with that big beaming smile that she always had. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was quite touched by the fact that her husband, Andrew, reached out to me after her passing to say that he and Kimberley's staff were contacting those people who were in her diaries—those who she had a special affinity with. I was on that list. That really touched me. I don't often get too emotional, but that brought a tear to my eye. To think that I was in that celebrated company who she thought were quite special really meant a lot to me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One only needs to read through or listen to the many tributes offered to Kimberley following her death, from so many people in so many walks of life, to know what a special person we've lost. She entered parliament and commenced her campaign for the Magnitsky act so that Australia could join its allies in imposing sanctions on human rights violators. What an amazing legacy she leaves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All too often in parliament, when you have the passing of someone, you stand for a moment's silence, perhaps speeches are given by the Prime Minister and opposition leader and it's referred to the Federation Chamber—I appreciate that they do the same in the Senate—and then that MP is remembered by their family and friends going forward, but the parliament moves on. Our busy work for and on behalf of the Australian public moves on. Maybe the politician served a long time; maybe not. Maybe they had a huge impact. Maybe they just served for a short time. The parliament moves on. But Kimberley Kitching's legacy will filter through this place for as long as this place is here. She will be remembered as somebody very, very special. She will not be forgotten. Others have come through this place, spent their time and moved on. They'll be remembered, yes, by their communities and by their loved ones. Yes, Kimberley Kitching will be remembered by her community, her state and her loved ones, but also by this parliament for the work she achieved and for the downtrodden she fought for. I think that that is very, very special. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thoughts, prayers and sympathies go to her family, her extended family and to the Labor family. I know you've lost a lot with Senator Alex Gallacher and Kimberley, and my heart goes out to you. It's a dreadful thing when colleagues pass away—certainly when they pass away before their time and before their work is done. May she rest in peace. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  The last time I saw Kimberley Kitching, she was in full flight. We were at the John Curtin Research Centre Gala Dinner. Curtin was a figure who made sense to Kimberley: principled, visionary, strong on defence, and Labor to the core—all qualities that Kimberley Kitching embodied. But that's not what I remember about that night. I remember Kimberley working the room in a sparkling number. She was absolutely in her element. In a crowded room, filled with comrades, sipping on a glass of wine and talking about matters of state, Kimberley was smiling and animated in every conversation, cheekily grinning, as she always did, charming those surrounding her with in-depth analysis on Ukraine, China, the economy, the federal election—on any topic, really. Only a week later, I received a call that shook me to my core. Kimberley was my friend, and I'll miss her. But, to be honest, Kimberley was more than that. She was someone I deeply admired, and that's something I didn't tell her enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley Kitching was probably the toughest person in this parliament. She was a force. Unafraid of being outnumbered, Kimberley did what she thought was right—always. She was a democrat: deeply passionate about the cause of democracy in Australia and around the world. She was never afraid to stray beyond our borders to take up causes of forgotten or voiceless people. She would take on dictators in authoritarian regimes and not blink an eye. Kimberley was not afraid. She was an activist in the truest of Labor traditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People have spoken of her skilled pursuit of the Magnitsky laws in Australia. I remember getting a call from Kimberley inviting me to a Zoom she'd organised with the great Bill Browder to talk about the proposed laws. In true Kitching style, it was a bipartisan group when I arrived on the Zoom, because Kimberley knew that this wasn't going to pass with Labor alone. After the meeting, Kimberley organised signed copies of Bill's book for the members and senators. She knew that creating a real connection with the cause was essential. It was skilful; it was graceful; it was smart politics; and it worked. Magnitsky is now being used, just as Kimberley imagined. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is an affront to everything Kimberley stood for: freedom, sovereignty and democracy, and I'm sure she would be quietly satisfied with Australia's strength and powers, knowing that she was the one who helped create them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley played politics hard, but she always navigated through the day-to-day with the good fun, humour and charm that made her fantastic company. When she first came into this place she had a lot of doubters and detractors, especially on the government's side of the House. But so many of those detractors were at her funeral last week, mourning her loss genuinely and sincerely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to home, Kimberley cared about Macnamara, or, as it was previously known, Melbourne Ports—an electorate in which she'd lived and been a local Labor Party delegate and a Caulfield Branch executive member. She loved the Caulfield Branch. She would come back and be a guest speaker at least once a year, and she'd tell anyone who listened what a special and diverse branch it was. In fact, I remember when she told me she'd suggested to News Corp columnist Chris Kenny that he should join her at one of the Caulfield Branch meetings one day. Apparently, it was because Chris Kenny had said that he imagined all Labor Party meetings would be filled with communists and socialists, so she'd said she'd prove him wrong by introducing him to one in suburban inner-south Melbourne, filled with Holocaust survivors and their descendants and those who fled Soviet-era Russia, rather than those radical socialists that Chris Kenny had imagined. I have to admit, I was a little relieved when Mr Kenny decided not to come to the branch. But it did show that Kimberley was keen to show off our little corner of the world to anyone who would listen. Kimberley saw the beauty in Macnamara, or Melbourne Ports, and especially in some of the hidden nooks where some of Melbourne's most disadvantaged people live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I became the Labor candidate, Kimberley did everything she could to help me win. She stood on prepoll booths, came for doorknocks and steered the 'Bill bus' into town. After my election, she continued to serve on Macnamara's campaign machine with ongoing advice and assistance to help keep Macnamara out of the hands of the Liberals and the Greens. She loved every corner of our special part of Melbourne, from Port Melbourne and Albert Park to St Kilda and Elwood, and across to my home in Caulfield, where she too once lived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was unflinchingly passionate about the Jewish community. Kimberley deplored anti-Semitism and loved the State of Israel, in the mould of Labor luminaries like Doc Evatt, Bob Hawke and Julia Gillard. One day she called me and suggested that we run a joint advertisement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Jewish News</span> and that she was happy to pay for it, and I said, 'Sure.' Only after agreeing did I learn that she hadn't booked one ad; she'd booked a full-page ad for a whole month to run in every edition. And that was Kimberley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She stood her ground and made her points emphatically. She loved politics. She loved the cause of Labor. She loved the Senate, and she believed in the great Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She can't be with us on election day or the government benches, but we can win this election in the fighting spirit that she embodied. Kimberley would want us to stand our ground, to remain strong and principled and to remain true to the Labor traditions of democracy, solidarity and representation for Australia's working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to conclude by wishing my deepest condolences to her family: her parents, Bill and Leigh; her brother, Ben; and, most of all, her soulmate, Andrew. If she was formidable enough solo, the two of them were truly meant to be in politics together. Andrew was unflinchingly dedicated to his wife, and Kimberley to him—a true partnership of love and loyalty. Kimberley was loved, and she loved in return. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the people of Macnamara, with special mention of her dear friends in her community, including my dear friend Dr Adam Carr; the Pinskier clan, Henry, Marcia, Abby, Rebecca and Jake; Dr Nick Dyrenfurth; Michael Borowick; Dean Sherr; Sylvia Freeman; and, of course, my predecessor Michael Danby and Amanda, and many, many more, we send our love to Andrew, her family and her loyal staff, and with a heavy heart we say, 'rest in peace,' to our dear friend Kimba. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I want to acknowledge the member for Macnamara on his fine contribution and also all of the many other fine testaments to our friend and our colleague Kimberley. It is a sad moment to be back here in parliament without Kimberley. I want to reflect on her achievements and legacy. Many have spoken about her various and significant achievements, but I'll just focus on some of the areas where our work intersected, primarily in defence matters, foreign policy and humanitarian action, and, in particular, that shambolic withdrawal out of Afghanistan and work to retrieve people and to save the lives of the people of Kabul. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley was always a very strong supporter of the Australian Defence Force and the defence forces of our allies. She wanted to understand deeply the work of the ADF and the struggles and sacrifices of our serving personnel and our veterans. She was a frequent and active participant in our Defence Force parliamentary program, travelling to the Middle East on several occasions: 2017, 2018 and 2019. I'm sure, if it weren't for COVID, she would have kept going over to the Middle East because she wanted to learn more. She wanted to hear the experiences of our defence personnel on the ground so that we could make sure that our support was as good as it possibly could be and that we were making sensible decisions in the national interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley had wanted very much to come to Darwin to participate in Operation Resolute through that parliamentary program, and we often talked about it. Unfortunately, she never had that opportunity, but she always made me know, as she had with many others, how important the work in their electorate for national security and the defence of our nation was and that she wanted to know as much as she possibly could. She would be very interested to know that Admiral John Aquilano, the Commander of the USINDOPACOM, or the US Indo-Pacific Command, had been in Australia and in Darwin recently. It's a visit that Kimberley would have very much appreciated. She did so much for our relationship with our allies the United States, and I know that our American friends very much appreciated her and her solidarity and intellect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley was the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of the United States, and she did a wonderful job in that role, being a great advocate for strengthening and deepening that important relationship. Of course, soon we'll have a new ambassador from the United States, the formidable Caroline Kennedy. Kimberley would have been such an important and effective representative to the new ambassador of not only our party but also this parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley believed, as I do, that our nation is extraordinary—that it's exceptional—and she spent every day in this place fighting to make Australia live up to our great potential. She said in her first speech to the Senate back in November 2016: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In this parliament, we must proudly make the case for Australian exceptionalism. Australia is not exceptional because we have been divinely mandated, or because of some inherent quality unasked and unearned; Australia is exceptional precisely because generations of Australians have made hard choices and hard sacrifices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all her vast policy interests and advocacy, Kimberley never lost sight of why she came to Canberra in the first place. And that is what makes her Labor. In her first speech, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I come here to represent everyday Australian people: the working Australians, the families, the students, the hospital cleaners, the retail workers, the mortgage holders, the renters, the mums and dads, the 4 am shift workers, the nurses, the police, the firefighters and the factory workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's a good reminder for all of us of why we are here and who we are ultimately working for. Ultimately, what I remember most about Kimberley is conversations when we were both talking to people on the ground in Kabul, or at the Pakistani border, within the ADF and within the US chain of command, trying to get people to safety who were in desperate need and, in some cases, being hunted. She was 'in the thick of it', as well described by the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, and others—she was getting after it, saving lives. I remember her beaming smile and her energy. I was glad to have the opportunity to tell that to Andrew when we gathered to dedicate a rosary to our departed sister Kimberley. May eternal light shine upon her.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  In her first speech to parliament, on 9 November 2016, Kimberley Kitching described herself as 'a swimmer thrown in the deep end'. She was somebody who brought a powerful voice to the Labor caucus. It has to be said that she was from quite a different part of the Labor Party than me. She came from the crucible of factional Victorian politics; I'm an independent from the ACT. She named her dogs after Ronald Reagan and his wife, she was a member of the Wolverines and she was an unabashed defender of Israel. Yet I greatly admired her and enjoyed her company. I shared her passion for the Labor Party, for workers' rights and for ridding the world of prejudice. I loved the way she expressed what it is to be a trade union leader in her very first speech. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I will never forget the call I got from a mother of four, a union member whose supervisor had unilaterally imposed a roster change without notice. She was sobbing in despair; she could barely get the words out. English was not her first language, but the agony and the desperation in her voice did not need words. The change in roster meant she would no longer be able to pick up her kids. And if she could not hold down her job she would not be able to feed them. On the other end of the line, I did what union reps do all over the country every day: I listened, I reassured and I promised to use every bit of strength the union had to solve her problem. And we did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And in that first speech to parliament Kimberley spoke too about the importance of ensuring that what she called 'the peddlers of prejudice' could not 'deceive Australians against their own interests'. So yes, I shared much in common, in a values sense, with her. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I also loved being in a political party that has the breadth of somebody with Kimberley's views and somebody with my views. That's what it is to be a party of government. And the longer I serve in the Labor caucus, the more I enjoy and admire that diversity. A party of government must be a broad church.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley was a wonderful person to be around. There are so many others who have said that. She had a love of champagne and she had a sparkling wit. And she was, I think, the best French speaker in the parliament. That's gone and, with it, the opportunity for me to pull out my very worst high-school French and add it to whatever interchange we were having by text message or Christmas card or in person. She's left an extraordinary legacy: the work that she did on the Magnitsky laws; her passionate, personal efforts to get people out of Afghanistan as the regime suddenly fell; and her work in Senate estimates, which broke several significant stories. As Bill Shorten has so beautifully put it, Senate estimates was, for Kimberley, like running onto the MCG.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can only imagine the pain that her parents, Leigh and Bill, and her brother, Ben, will be feeling, and the pain too of those who were especially close to her—you, Deputy Speaker Dick, and Bill Shorten, who spoke so movingly at her funeral and in the parliament—and, of course, her husband, Andrew Landeryou. As Bill put it in his eulogy, 'We're all in the blast zone of Kimberley's loss, but Andrew Landeryou is at ground zero.' It's that pain that we understand and acknowledge, and we know that, no matter the effluxion of time, it will never be truly healed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew, just know that Kimba made a big impact on so many of us in a personal sense and in a policy sense. She was a true and treasured part of the Labor caucus, and she will be dearly missed. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  It's been a few weeks now that have passed and I'm still in a kind of state of shock about the death of my colleague and, more importantly, my friend Kimberley Kitching. It hasn't really sunk in, in many respects, because Kimba was so full of life—so full of it that I still expect her to walk around the corner or to see her in the corridors here in parliament. She was so full of life. She was so full of ideas, of insights, of laughter, of fun—in some respects, a rarity not just in politics but in life. She was mischievous, vivacious and charming, and she was such great company. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When my wife and I returned to Melbourne in 2010, after spending many years away—partly overseas and interstate—we met up with Kimberley and Andrew. Our first dinner together was all very interesting. There was discussion about Latin and discussions about the Roman Senate. I said, 'This won't do.' I said to Kimberley and Andrew, 'Have you seen <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Lebowski</span>, the movie?' and they hadn't. So she was lacking a little bit of that popular culture. I said, 'That's it. We're going to take you—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">An honourable senator interjecting—</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KHALIL:</span>
                  </a>  Exactly! I said, 'Enough of talking about the Roman Senate and Cicero. We're going to watch <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Lebowski</span>.' So we took Andrew and Kimba to the very famous Astor Theatre. I don't know if you've been there. It's a beautiful Art Deco theatre. I knew Kimberley would love it because of the architectural design and aesthetic beauty of that theatre, and its age and history. It just so happened that, on the night we went to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Lebowski</span> at the Astor Theatre, it was one of those specials where everybody got dressed up as the characters. There were a lot of people there, either dressed up as German nihilists in black or like Jeff Bridges' character, Lebowski, in the poncho. And she had the most wonderful time. I think Andrew was a bit bemused by the whole thing but Kimba just loved it. I think she was secretly hoping that if she'd known she would have worn the poncho herself. She would have looked great in that, given her fashion sense. She would have made it work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, in a friendship over a decade since that time, I knew someone who was intellectually formidable, courageous and strident in articulating her views, and so generous with her friends. Kimba would have been more than aware of the Keatingesque axiom that if you don't make enemies in politics you're not doing it right. She would have known that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day that she passed I was actually scheduled to give her a call, to chat to her about my recent trip to the US with the PJCIS security and intelligence and security committee delegation that I was on with her friend Senator James Paterson. I never had the opportunity to have that conversation with her. She would have been so interested in all of the foreign policy and national security issues that we discussed over there on the trip, what was happening in Washington and all the inside information on what's going on in the Biden administration. She would have been revelling in it. I was really looking forward to that conversation with Kimberley about that trip, over a coffee or maybe a glass of champagne if it was later in the day. These are issues that we've discussed together over many, many years, over the decade and a bit that I've known her. And I still can't believe I won't have those conversations with her again. I can't believe I won't hear her laughter; I can't believe that I won't see her friendly smile again, or even have the opportunity just to get stuck into those policy issues that we both cared so much about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of us as politicians in this place talk about legacy, or even the lack of legacy, in governing, in our decision-making and in our careers. I tell you what: while Kimba never got to serve—will never have the chance to serve—in a federal Labor government that she so wanted to be a part of, she nonetheless leaves a remarkable legacy. It is all the more outstanding and remarkable for the fact that she delivered a legacy from opposition, from her role as an opposition senator. Her commitment and persistence in pushing the Magnitsky-style laws that we've talked about in these condolences through our parliament, as we've heard, won her international recognition and human rights awards. But I think, for her, more important than any award in London—although she would have loved the party—would have been the fact that she has made a real difference to our democracy, in the sense of the contest that democracies around the world are having with authoritarian states. That is a legacy. That is of substance. I think she would be so proud of that—and it is of the time, given the inflection point we're in, in global affairs, that she had, as an individual, this kind of impact. It includes the sanctions that we've just now imposed on individuals, through Magnitsky legislation, across the world, in so many different instances. The swifter and better-targeted response from the Australian government to international crimes and human rights abuses is in no small measure because of Senator Kimberley Kitching's work and effort to get those laws passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She will be missed, as we've said, both as a friend and, for us, as a colleague, across the aisle and in all parts of this parliament. It didn't matter which party you were from; she had friends. It didn't matter whether you were an independent or a Green or a Liberal or a National. She's going to be missed by all of us, but she's also going to be missed by this parliament because of her work and her substance, and she's going to be missed by this country. I think of all of the opportunities missed that she would have contributed to, in what are very uncertain times that we face. We mourn her loss as a friend, but we mourn her loss to the country as well, in the contribution that she would have made. But we'll keep and hold on tight to her legacy, and I think it's incumbent upon all of us to continue that work in her memory so that it's not in vain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My heart and my deepest condolences go out to her husband, Andrew Landeryou, and to all of her family. Andrew's life was completely wrapped around Kimberley. It was a real love story. They were inseparable; they were part of each other; they circled each other like two suns in a dual solar system, and he's lost his sunshine, in many respects. So my heart goes out to Andrew, and I think he needs a lot of love and care around him as well after losing a lifelong partner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vale, Kimberley. You were a warrior and a champion for just causes, for freedom, for democracy and for human rights, and we will not forget you, and we will carry on your legacy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I join with many others in this place, and in the other place, to speak on the motion of condolence on the death of Senator Kimberley Kitching. I first met Kimberley when she arrived in this building as a senator of the parliament in 2016. I, along with a few others here today, had been elected to the House of Representatives only a few months earlier. It's always difficult to understand the death of someone so young. Kimberley died at the age of 52. I turn 49 tomorrow, so this puts things in a particular and special perspective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to offer my sincere condolences to Andrew, her husband; to her parents, Bill and Leigh; and to her brother, Ben. I had the opportunity to speak with them and listen to some stories from them following the rosary that was said at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne recently on the eve of her funeral in that same place. One can hardly imagine the pain Andrew is going through, or one simply can't imagine it. I have been married for over 20 years, and to lose your life partner so suddenly is unimaginable. I cannot imagine what he's going through. To her brother: I have brothers, too. It's a difficult and, again, unimaginable circumstance—and, of course, for her parents, Bill and Leigh. Bill told a number of stories at the front of the cathedral—these stories we all share to help relieve our pain and be able to relive our memories of the wonderful woman that Kimberley was. And for her parents that must have been especially painful. So I thank them for the gift they gave us in Kimberley, and for having raised her—and what an amazing life she led before I met her, with the opportunities her parents gave her to travel the world, to learn languages: to have such a vast experience. It was of immense value to everyone who knew her, but especially to those of us in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge, also, the Queenslanders and Victorians in this place, and elsewhere, of course, who knew Kimberley much better than I knew her. They had been a part of her life forever, and she part of theirs, and it's very important to acknowledge their sadness at this time—and, of course, that of her old friends Bill Shorten and Chloe Shorten, who had been with her and beside her in many circumstances for many years. I'd like to acknowledge the commitment of Kimberley's staff. They really are a remarkable team. Maree, Jordan, Hanisha and David were absolutely committed to Kimberley and her causes as well, and we're all very well aware of the causes that Kimberley followed and pursued. She would—and I wouldn't dare speak for Kimberley even when she was alive—have acknowledged that she could not have done her work without them, and I thank you for all you did for Kimberley and the support you offered her in challenging times. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been said about Kimberley's life and about her contribution to this parliament. For my part, I have learnt more about her following her sudden death than I learnt in our short five years of friendship. That is at once the sadness and joy of this place and of being an elected member of parliament. The joy is that you get to meet people you might never expect to meet but for being brought together to represent the Australian people. You make new friendships with people from right across the country, from different walks of life, with many different experiences, different perspectives and, of course, different life stories. The sadness is, of course, that you meet people here but you don't get to know them as well as you might like to because each of us have to return to our constituencies all the time. We have other obligations, and busy lives undertaken all around the country keep us from knowing one another better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after hearing about Kimberley's death I wrote on social media that I considered Kimberley a steadfast and supportive colleague, smart, hardworking, dedicated, funny and fun to be around. I wish I had told her that, but we always wish for what we cannot have when it is all too late. I enjoyed her company immensely. Everyone has remarked on her mischievous giggle and her remarkable smile, and it is true to say that she did brighten the room, any room, every time she walked into it. She was one of the smartest people I've met, and many people have remarked on her remarkable ability with languages. The work she did in international relations was immense. Her work and persistence pursuing the Magnitsky-style legislation that's now been enacted in this parliament and been used will be a lasting legacy of hers. Her active five years in parliament put many of us to shame. I feel exhausted just listening to the speeches about her and all that she achieved. It's truly a magnificent and lasting legacy of Senator Kimberley Kitching. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my part, I'd like to acknowledge the help she provided me with Senate estimates. Not many people tune in to the Trade part of the Senate estimates—shocking, I know! It's usually held at six or eight o'clock on a Thursday night, and I relied greatly on senators like Kimberley and Senator Tim Ayres to pursue and hold the government to account in that portfolio of international trade, which is so important to our nation. Kimberley would grab my questions and be really enthusiastic about them at a time of day, and during a process of the Senate estimates, which was unenviable, not very attractive and not very high profile. I'm very grateful for the assistance that she and her office always gave me. I will miss our briefings on the day before Senate estimates. It was always good to have 'a partner in crime' on that type of portfolio with Kimberley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many things have been said about Kimberley's experience in this place and in her political life. And many things have been said about this place over the last couple of years—the behaviours that we see in and around it. When these discussions come up, I take it as an opportunity to reflect on my own behaviour and I hope everyone else does as well. There are many things that one needs to achieve in this place—your own personal aims but also those of the party—for the good of the people you represent. How we go about achieving these things is as important as achieving them. It is a contest. Everyone has remarked that we sit at the pinnacle of power in this country. It's a hard and passionate contest at times, and sometimes we may behave in ways we shouldn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've taken this time to reflect and wonder if, in my ambitions and the things I'm trying to achieve, I have ever overstepped a mark, said something I shouldn't have or perhaps been a bit pushy when I shouldn't have. I think it's important that we all enter those moments of self-reflection at these times. I hope that we get the feedback we need when we carry out our work and try to treat each other with great respect. I believe everyone does do that, but sometimes you don't know when you're not. Some people need to get that reminder; they might not personally be doing it, but self-reflection is enormously important. I say that in relation to discussions that've been had about Kimberley's experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley is now with God; in His arms she rests. It doesn't seem to me, having known Kimberley for a short time, that she would ever rest in life or in death. I can only imagine her running around heaven trying to track down the late, great US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for another remarkable discussion about the dangers of fascism around the world and what we must all do to contest it. That is how I like to think about death. I think it's naive, but, as someone of the Catholic faith, I believe in another life after this life and I know Kimberley did as well. She lived her best life while she had it. It ended too early. I'm deeply sad about that. I offer my condolences to her family, all her friends and all who knew her much better than me. She was very well-loved. Vale, Kimberley Kitching.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  Our hearts go out to Kimberley's husband, Andrew; her parents, Leigh and Bill; her brother, Ben; Bill Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, his wife, Chloe, and their kids; and Kimberley's staff and family. We thank Andrew, Leigh, Bill and Ben for giving Kimberley to all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We Labor moderates are in deep shock. I can remember my staff telling me the news of Kimberley's passing when I came back to my electorate office in Ipswich. Deputy Speaker, you and I were both at a meeting of the Greater Springfield branch of the Labor Party that night presenting reports on our local electorates and how we were flooded. I was late to that meeting. As I arrived, I turned to you and said, 'Have you told the branch about Kimberley?' You were stony-faced and looking straight ahead. I couldn't do anything other than look down because I felt like I wanted to cry when I looked at you. She had been a friend of yours for decades, a friend of mine, a factional ally and someone we knew very well. That's the impact she had on people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley was urbane and charming, erudite and eloquent and abounding in intelligence. She had a heart not just for God but for people. Her breadth of knowledge would shame a diplomat. She had the ferocity of an advocate—a QC in full flight. She was smart and savvy and stylish. Bill Shorten talked about going onto the MCG. Well, she was a Queenslander. She might have represented Victoria in the Senate, but she was a Queenslander at heart, and I could see her at Lang Park. She'd put on that gear—those clothes—and you'd go to a meeting with her—she represented me at Senate estimates—and you'd go to a meeting with Senator Kimberley Kitching, and that's what she looked like: she was Senator Kimberley Kitching. It wasn't just Kimba; it was Senator Kimberley Kitching. You'd go to that meeting—and she was thoroughly prepared for Senate estimates, I'm telling you. There's a great tradition we have in the Labor Party—sadly we've been in opposition for too long—and we have contemporary people like Senator Penny Wong and Senator Kim Carr who are great advocates and investigators. She was in the great tradition of Senator John Faulkner and Senator Robert Ray. She was in that tradition, and she was there. She was thoroughly prepared. There was a lawyer I trained many years ago who said to me that one of the things that I taught him was: preparation, preparation, preparation. No-one had to teach Kimberley Kitching preparation. She was completely prepared. She had the discipline of an athlete in Senate estimates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I loved talking with her. If my background was quite provincial, hers was international. She might have been a Queenslander—and she went to the University of Queensland a decade after me—but you could have conversations with Kimberley about arcane factional matters in the Australian Labor Party in Victoria, discussions about the long history of the United States and the progress of democratic politics, and discussions about art and culture in Europe with her, all at the same time. She could talk about esoteric language issues, because she had such a breadth of so many different languages. Goodness knows where she picked them all up and how she learnt them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that really struck me is how ahead of her time she was. The former member for Melbourne Ports Michael Danby got onto me about this Magnitsky act and about the fact that we needed to do this in Australia. Kimberley was on it as well. And I remember saying, 'Michael, what are you really on about? What's this about helping victims of justice and making pariahs of pariah states and individuals?' Kimberley was recognised for that, and we have that legacy in our Australian democracy because of Kimberley's initiative and advocacy. I pay tribute to Michael as well. He talked about this for such a long period of time. And Michael was a great friend of Kimberley. I've had many dinners with Michael Danby and Kimberley Kitching. I'm going to miss those dinners. I'm going to miss those late-night chats that so many of us have had—you thought you'd ring her up and ask her about something, and the conversation would go on for half an hour or an hour. She was almost like a confessor you'd talked to, but also someone who knew so much. I think she had a great heart for people—and a heart for people internationally, as has been recorded. I say amen to all those comments that people have made about her work, whether it involved the Hong Kong activists for democracy or the Uighurs or the Tibetans. Talking to her about the work she did in Afghanistan—she was quite modest about it, to be honest with you—I think she had a great understanding that Labor is the protector of the national interest but also the advocate for social change in this country. She was an evolutionist; she wasn't a revolutionary. She was a moderate, and she was proud of it. But she had a great heart and she understood the Labor Party and the Labor movement, and she was proud that she was union and proud that she was she was Labor. She had an understanding of where we'd come from as a country and where we needed to go. On the Labor side of politics, we believe in the collective—the union movement and the Labor Party. But it requires an individual sometimes to be its conscience—to say yes or to say no and to hold minority views that aren't always popular. Kimberley was like that: a person of courage and conviction. At times it requires someone to build coalitions across the aisle, as the Americans would say. I could not believe the day she told me that she was mates with Pauline Hanson. I had been campaigning against Pauline Hanson and One Nation since 1996 in Ipswich. I couldn't believe it. But she was. She had friends across both sides of politics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to miss those conversations. I'm going to miss her jocularity and fun. The last time I had a conversation with her, I was in Bill Shorten's office during the religious discrimination bill, which we were discussing. She was there, in fine form, talking about every issue you could possibly imagine, international and domestic. Bill was there. She was there. A number of people's staff were there, waiting around. She might have liked a glass of champagne, but I am telling you that that just lubricated her immense intelligence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to end on one scriptural note. I looked this up because I thought she would understand this—the sacred exhortation to people of faith. Kimberley was a deep Catholic and had a great understanding of where she stood in that Catholic tradition. It was found in the Book of Isaiah 1:17:</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  This morning Senator Kimberley Kitching would have been at our regular Wednesday morning meeting of the full committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. She would have been, I imagine, as always, well read. She would have read all the briefs and she would have certainly had a pile of questions, very thoughtful questions, to ask after the presentation from whoever our special guests were for the day. Her absence this morning was a reminder to us all just how fragile and unpredictable life is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw Kimberley for the last time on 5 March, when we attended the Australia India Business Council gala dinner. I had recently been invited to join the advisory board of the Australia India Business Council, and Kimberley had a long-term association with the council. It was a very enjoyable evening at the Fox Classic Car Collection venue in Melbourne, and Kimberley was one of the keynote speakers. She spoke eloquently and meaningfully about the importance of the Australia-India relationship, particularly its significance around the issues of trade and national security and the importance of both Australia and India as emerging powers in our Asia-Pacific region. These were areas that Kimberley had a very deep interest in and a prolific knowledge of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of our colleagues have spoken of her interest in foreign affairs and national security and her deep interest in the pursuit of human rights issues and democracy. I had the opportunity to witness firsthand, in the time that we spent together as members of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, this abiding interest and awareness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We both also served on the Human Rights Subcommittee, and I witnessed there, also firsthand, her passion in pursuing the Magnitsky legislation. It was during this period that I got to know her better. I admittedly came to be very impressed by many of her qualities, especially her intellect and her worldliness. These are qualities that have been spoken about widely because they really are qualities and attributes that marked and defined Kimberley Kitching. They are qualities that are much needed up here in this place, qualities that give depth and meaning to issues that are of domestic and national importance and qualities that allow for meaningful debate, even where there are differences of opinion. I can assure you, Deputy Speaker, Kimberley and I did have a different perspective on some issues, one of which was the issue of Palestine and Israel. Both of us held passionately different perspectives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place, where I believe over 90 per cent of our colleagues are monolingual, Kimberley Kitching was multilingual—or polyglossi, as we say in Greek. She spoke French, Italian, Spanish, English and Latin, and I believe she had some Russian and German. As a bilingual person myself—Greek being my other language—I was thoroughly appreciative of Kimberley's multilingual talents, not only because they were indicators of an ability to engage with different cultural nuances but also because I know that being able to speak other languages opens your mind to the wonders of the world and its many cultures. It broadens understanding and fosters tolerance and makes for an excellent ambassador to the world, which Kimberley Kitching no doubt was. On all those trips she had taken abroad as a member of the Australian Senate, she would have impressed those that she met; I have no doubt about that. That itself would have been a real boost for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, I witnessed the impact of this ability to impress our foreign dignitaries here in Canberra. Some years ago Kimberley and I were at a function at the residence of the then Moroccan Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Karim Medric. I introduced Kimberley to Karim, and she responded immediately to him in the French language. I was impressed and so was His Excellency. They then continued their conversation and interaction in the French language, and, although I only have the obligatory high-school French, which is probably only a few words now, I could hear the fluency and the perfect intonation as she spoke in the French language. I was so impressed to discover this about Kimberley that, of course, I had to ask her how and why this was possible. She then went on to tell me about her schooling in France and elsewhere around the world, and we all know a lot more about that now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley's sudden passing at such a young age is a tragic reminder that, here in this place, we don't pause enough to get to know our colleagues and to learn more about them. My last conversation with Kimberley was varied. It included the forthcoming election, but more so it was about the Australia-India relationship and, all the way through, we took time to speak about the vintage cars in the collection that surrounded us at that venue. I was looking forward to working with Kimberley on the Australia India Business Council because, apart from my own engagement on foreign affairs issues, my interest in this also relates to my own electorate where we've settled large numbers of migrants from India and the subcontinent. As a Victorian senator, Kimberley was very active in her engagement with our local diverse communities with which she herself had a very strong relationship, including with the emerging Nepalese community. I often wonder now how long it would have taken her—if she hadn't started already—to begin learning the Nepali language or even Hindi, because she certainly had that gift. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also makes you wonder how much more she would have achieved, because she was capable of so much more, as reflected in her fine achievements thus far, including a Magnitsky Human Rights Award. It is therefore fitting that our party, the Labor Party, has chosen to honour her with the Kimberley Kitching Human Rights Award. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I left on that night of 5 March, the last words Kimberley and I exchanged were making an agreement to meet up at the Psarakos brothers in High Street, Thornbury, for a cup of coffee, and I was to buy her a jar of Cretan thyme honey. She had discovered the delicious beauty of this honey—known to me, of course, since childhood—and I promised to buy her a jar of the best thyme honey ever. That following Thursday I learnt of her passing. The shock was greater still because I had seen her only five days before: elegantly dressed, as always, for the occasion, and—as our female host of the night remarked on that night—so full of life, so learned, so aware and so engaging. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Death is such a final and cruel blow. In extinguishing a life, it steals potential. Kimberley was too young to die. She had so much more to offer and many mountains still to conquer. To her family—her parents, Bill and Leigh, and her brother, Ben: my condolences. Your loss is immense. To her husband, Andrew, who will feel the burden of her loss beyond what can ever be imagined: may the memory of your life together give you comfort and strength. Andrew, as I promised Kimberley that jar of honey, I hope to be able to give it to you in her memory. Vale, Senator Kimberley Kitching. </span>

I hope that his memories of how much adventure and joy and achievement they were able to squeeze into their time together provide Andrew with some consolation during these difficult days. I also offer my condolences to Kimberley's parents, Leigh and Bill, as well as to her brother, Ben. It was always clear to me how much Kimberley valued family, and how much her family provided her with a bedrock of support during good times and bad. My thoughts are also with Kimberley's staff, who I worked with often over recent years. She loved them, and they loved her. There was a deep and shared passion and purpose in her office. I also acknowledge the loss felt by Bill and Chloe Shorten, who lost a lifelong friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley and I met and became friends while we were both active in the ever-changing and exhilarating right wing of the Victorian Labor Party. It's fair to say that that background remained a constant over the coming years. We worked together as ministerial advisers in the Bracks and Brumby governments, a time when I saw firsthand Kimberley's passion for policy and creativity for outcomes. During this period, she and I shared a passion for rigorous economic policy in the Hawke-Keating mould. This was an approach to economic policy that was central to both of those Victorian governments, and one that we worked on and both took great satisfaction in working on together to that end. Finally, we were parliamentary colleagues together during the current term of this parliament. It was during this time that the focus of our discussions turned more to foreign policy, and it was during this term of government that Kimberley achieved so much in that realm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley had so many qualities, each of which could fill a speech. She had intellect, loyalty and a vivacious embrace of life, all of which were evident throughout the period I knew her. I want to focus today on her courage, her creativity and her loyalty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Winston Churchill once said, 'Without courage, all other virtues lose their meaning.' Kimberley's abundance of courage meant that all of her other virtues were that much more impactful. Kimberley clearly had courage and, like Churchill, was willing to suffer criticism in the short term, from friend and foe alike, if she felt that was necessary to take a stand that would be vindicated in the long term. She saw threats looming for Australia and our allies on the horizon. She was one of the first to stand up for the Uighurs, the Tibetans and the residents of Hong Kong. She recognised the need to draw attention to human rights abuses, and she made a strong, unambiguous case for autocratic regimes to be held to account. Kimberley's life demonstrated how courage can effectively leverage other virtues—in her case, her intelligence, her compassion and her creativity—and how courage could make them more impactful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley's most high-profile achievement was her championing, over many years, of Magnitsky legislation. Australia now has a Magnitsky act in large part as a result of Kimberley's efforts. This was a reform that was far from unanimously supported when it was raised some years ago. It took tenacity and inexhaustible reservoirs of energy to maintain the momentum for the passage of this bill over a period spanning years. But it wasn't just determination. She also showed incredible creativity. When a parliamentary committee considered the bill, Kimberley organised for evidence to be provided by, amongst others, Amal Clooney, Geoffrey Rush and Bill Browder. Highlighting the international dimension of support for such legislation undoubtedly strengthened the case for Australia to join with our allies. Marshalling all of this support was no mean feat, and few if any other people in parliament could have achieved this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember catching up many times with Kimberley for a morning coffee and comparing our schedules. I would complain about having had to attend a dinner the night before with a stakeholder; she would then recount having been an online participant in a panel at 2 am or 4 am at Harvard or Oxford, with a raft of internationally recognised academics or public thinkers. It was clear to me that she was right at home in these elite gatherings and that she maintained regular contact with these people that she met. It always left me thinking how inadequate my efforts were. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her achievements on Magnitsky weren't just about seeing clearly the right path to take; they were also about having the connections, the persuasiveness and the energy to bring unexpected resources to bear in the support of her case at a critical juncture in time. Her other virtues—her intelligence, her tenacity and her creativity—were leveraged by her courage. As many others have noted, her sustained contribution led to her being awarded a Sergei Magnitsky Human Rights Award. I am pleased that a permanent human rights award has now been created in her honour in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the field of human rights there are too many achievements to recount, but another that bears noting was her personal intervention to save 30 people from the chaos of the fall of Kabul. Once again, it was her intelligence, hard work and creativity leveraged to her courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her inaugural speech, Kimberley posed some fundamental questions for herself, her colleagues and the nation. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is time to decide what kind of parliament we will be. Will we live down to the cynicism of the community about politicians, or will we show leadership in challenging days? It is time to decide what kind of party Labor will be. Will we be seduced by the glamour of narrow interest-group politics, or will we continue to fight for all Australians? It is time to decide what kind of country we are. Will we shirk the decisions that face us, or will we once again rise to the moment and choose what is hard, what is complex, what is right?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She answered her own questions through her own deeds, and in her short time in this place she painted on the largest of canvases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much else that could be said of Kimberley. She was a piercing cross-examiner in estimates; she was a public policy wonk and a voracious reader; she was a committed trade unionist, particularly for some of our most vulnerable workers; and, of course, she was a patriot, so often willing to put the interests of our nation above all else. Above and beyond these qualities were her qualities as a loyal friend. As Andrew noted in his powerful eulogy, 'With Kimberley, it was all in.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley always greeted you joyfully with an embrace and a kiss on the cheek as if you hadn't seen her for an age. Kimberley made you feel that every discussion was something profound. Kimberley was a political friend that you knew would be there in thick and thin. Politics can be fickle, but Kimberley could never be accused of that. She left an indelible mark on Australia's public life and on all of those lucky to have been her friend. I will miss her terribly. May she rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Ms FLINT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Boothby</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I would just acknowledge the member's lovely contribution about his dear friend the late Senator Kimberley Kitching. Everyone has spoken beautifully about her and her incredible contribution to our nation, particularly to this parliament. It's probably been hard for everybody to speak about Kimberley, because it is a terrible tragedy that we've lost her at just the age of 52. To lose anyone at that age is a tragedy, and to have to remember a brilliant, vibrant woman taken from her friends, her family, our parliament and the Australian people at just age 52 is truly tragic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The word 'tragedy' is probably used too freely these day, but Senator Kimberley Kitching's death at just 52, in the prime of her life, in the prime of her political and policymaking skills is just that, a genuine tragedy. It's a tragedy for her devoted husband, Andrew, and our hearts go out to him; her parents, Bill and Leigh; her brother, Ben; her devoted friends, like Bill and Chloe Shorten, Diana Asmar; and so many of those opposite who have spoken so beautifully. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a tragedy for her devoted staff, who, as we heard yesterday from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, were very hard working. They put something like 12,000 questions on notice to government in this term of parliament alone. I'm sure that's somewhat of a record. But the loss of Kimberley is a tragedy for Labor and, ultimately, for our nation. We have lost such a fine woman and such a fine mind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories about Kimberley's achievements, her incredible generosity, her talent for policymaking, that we've heard since her death have emphasised what a huge loss she is to our nation. We know about her tireless work to see the Magnitsky act passed and the international award recognising her work on the act, her work on human rights, including her rescue of some 30 people from Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban and whose names her dear friend the member for Maribyrnong recorded in his condolence motion yesterday, and I think we're all grateful to him for doing that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her funeral last week was testament to her generosity of spirit and her vibrant spirit, attracting people from across the political divide, and I was in attendance. There were ambassadors, diplomats and people whose lives she had touched and, indeed, saved. I doubt there are many other members of parliament, from around the globe, who are sent a personal message from the Dalai Lama to recognise their passing. Such was the person that Kimberley Kitching was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did not know Kimberley really well, but she touched my life as she has touched the lives of so many others. Despite us never having properly met, Kimberley penned a generous opinion piece about me on 17 March last year, in response to my speech to parliament pleading for everyone in politics, but particularly Labor, to ensure an end to sexist, misogynist and dangerous behaviour towards women in politics and public life. And I have to say, I do struggle to read the opinion piece that she wrote—it was not published, but she sent it on to me through the member for Canning—and I struggle because it's so kind, generous and courageous, and it shows her incredible character. But I also struggle because, as we unfortunately now know, she herself was having a hard time, as a woman in politics, for many reasons more than those that she shared in her opinion piece. I think, perhaps, her compassion was unfortunately based in her lived experience, and I can only say I'm sorry that I didn't know. And, because of this, there was nothing I could do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to share a few of her words, as they are a reminder to us all to do better, to protect and look after each other and to try to make politics a safer place for us all. Because if it isn't then our democracy is weaker and our community loses their easy access to us as their elected representatives, and that makes it so much harder for us to do our jobs. Kimberley wrote: 'My party needs to be much more vigilant in shutting down and repudiating gender-based political violence, particularly when we know ahead of time that it's likely to arise in heated political contests, from the fringes, from idiots, online trolls, from the kinds of supporters you don't really want but are too embarrassed to call out publicly.' But I want to be clear: it's not just Labor's responsibility; it is all of our responsibility to call out this sort of behaviour, to stop this behaviour, so that we can get on with our jobs representing our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that our government—my government—and this parliament have strengthened the electoral act to give better protection to MPs and candidates, that we introduced the Online Safety Act that was passed by the parliament to prevent and give greater protection from cyberbullying and trolls. These are the sorts of things that, if we all keep working together, make sure that our democracy stays strong and that people are safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kimberley also wrote the following in her opinion piece from March last year: 'I'm sorry the necessarily robust contest over a marginal seat between our two great parties turned into an occasional debacle where misogyny was weaponised against you, where you felt unsafe and denigrated. I don't know you well, but you seem such a graceful, confident, tough, articulate, passionate person. And I am deeply troubled that it appears gendered political violence has caused you, a formidable politician, to fall out of love with politics and has prompted you to decide to leave. And for that, I am deeply sorry; not just for you but what it says about all of us, and the limits Australian society is allowing to be put on the contribution of Australian women.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Kimberley's incredibly kind words are better directed at her. She was graceful, confident, tough, articulate and passionate, but also unbelievably kind and compassionate. She was a Christian. Her Catholic faith guided her. She was vibrant and vivacious, with wonderful wit and humour and an enthusiasm for life. She was a patriot and a warrior, as so many have recorded. She was a patriot and a warrior for Australia, our freedom and the freedom of so many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I remember very clearly the last time I saw Kimberley. It was on the day of my valedictory speech on 16 February this year. She was leaving the Sky studio here in Parliament House with one of her loyal and dedicated staff members, Jordan, having just appeared on <span style="font-style:italic;">Paul Murray Li</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ve</span>. As we know, Kimberley was not afraid of the contest of ideas, even in what might be classed by some as enemy territory. She looked absolutely gorgeous. She was in a beautifully fitted white suit and she just looked radiant. She gave me one of her enormous smiles that, as we all know, lit up a room; a kiss on the cheek, as everyone has recorded she would greet you with; and a big hug; and she asked how I was. That is how I will always remember Senator Kimberley Kitching—gorgeous and glowing and, as ever, so kind. Rest in peace, lovely lady.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I'd like to join with colleagues on this sad occasion to pay my respects to the late Senator Kimberley Kitching. I acknowledge the contribution that my colleague the member for Boothby has just made and the contributions that others in this chamber have made today. Like others, I found Kimberley a kind, generous, warm, intelligent, committed parliamentarian, a person who sought justice in every way she could for those who could not, in many instances, find it for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of travelling on two delegations with Kimberley, one to the Tibetan administration in exile. We went to Delhi first, to meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and then we travelled further north in India to the foothills of the Himalayas at Dharamsala, where we met with officials of the Tibetan administration in exile. That was a wonderful journey, an opportunity, travelling around in four-wheel-drive vehicles in that mountainous region, visiting many of the places that were so important to the Tibetan people and meeting with their leaders. One of my treasured memories of Kimberley is a photo of both of us with a group of Tibetan children at a school that we visited there. Others have spoken about her warm smile, the twinkle in her eye and that glow in her face, and they're just captured in that photo of Kimberley. That was an important example of her commitment to seeking human rights for people wherever they are in the world. The other delegation was an ASEAN delegation to three of the ASEAN nations: Myanmar, Singapore and Indonesia. Once again, particularly in Myanmar—before the current troubles but when the problems with the Rohingya were occurring—Kimberley was seeking to try and improve the human rights of so many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is through human rights that I believe she will be most remembered. I had the privilege of co-chairing, with her, the group of parliamentary friends of democracy in Hong Kong—and democracy is something which sadly has disappeared under the Chinese Communist regime. It is the greatest tribute to her that she championed, for such a long time in this parliament, the adoption of Magnitsky-type legislation. I have the privilege of chairing the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's Human Rights Subcommittee, of which Kimberley was a member, and members on both sides of this parliament unanimously proposed that we should have Magnitsky-type legislation. There can be no greater tribute to her than the fact that that legislation passed unanimously through this parliament. Indeed, just in the last couple of days, the government has used that legislation to sanction individuals for human rights abuses, kleptocracy and similar, related offences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many other members and senators, I had the privilege of attending her funeral at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne. That was such a wonderful tribute to her, not just in the words that were spoken by many, including her friend the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, but also in the cross-section of people who attended that funeral. There were people there from all walks of life. There were people from both sides of politics. Importantly, there were people that she stood for, that she had represented, and who shared her values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one thing that one can say about Kimberley is that she was a parliamentarian. I'm not sure that I would describe everybody in this place as a parliamentarian, but she certainly was. And she made that a forte.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what's important about someone like Kimberley was that she believed that you should plant your standard in the ground and say: 'Here I stand, or here I fall.' And that was what she was prepared to do. She acted courageously on many occasions in saying: 'These are the things which I stand for,' and I think this parliament is only enhanced by having people—regardless of what their particular views might be or what their causes are—who are prepared to plant their standard in the ground like that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I join with all my colleagues in extending my condolences—particularly to her many friends, and I wish to note one in this regard. My former chief of staff Brendan Darcy was a very, very good friend of Kimberley and Andrew. I think they met for coffee most weekends in Maribyrnong, where they lived, and I know that he, along with many others, is truly saddened by the premature death of Kimberley Kitching. To her husband, Andrew, to her parents and to her brother, I extend my sincere condolences. May she rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in the condolence motion for Moss Cass, the Hon. Moses Henry Cass, who was Australia's first environment and conservation minister in, of course, the Whitlam government. We've heard some really terrific condolence speeches for Moss Cass in the main chamber in support of this condolence motion, and, as the shadow environment minister, I wanted to make a contribution as well, to recognise the really nation-changing work that he did as our first environment and conservation minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was also, more broadly, someone of very progressive bent. You heard him described yesterday, or the day before, as 'the minister for lost causes' in the Whitlam government. But they weren't lost causes; he was just well ahead of his time. He was a proponent for legalising cannabis. He was a proponent for legalising abortion. He was a proponent for legalising homosexuality. He was a pioneer of universal health care. He was responsible for creating the SBS. He was responsible for issuing experimental radio licences, forming the basis for community radio broadcasting here in Australia. He was someone whose activism has left an indelible mark on Australia. And Australian society—in some cases, decades later—has caught up to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember reading, in a biography, actually, of Harriet Harman, the UK Labour deputy leader and former acting leader, that she talked about the phenomenon where what was considered to be radical could then turn into orthodoxy. And that's certainly a hallmark of Labor: sometimes what we put forward can be described by some as radical, but it later becomes orthodoxy and seems, in retrospect, to have been inevitable. And you could certainly say that about Dr Cass and the work that he did and the ideas that he had. Deputy Speaker, I know that you would have an affinity with Dr Cass—both of you medical practitioners and people who stand strongly for environmental protection and conservation. Isn't it terrific that we have a tradition of medical doctors who come to this place? They bring their medical expertise. They also bring a progressive approach and a commitment to many causes much broader than their own discipline and professional capacity. With respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and with respect to the late Dr Cass, doctors understand that everything is interconnected—that, to be a healthy society, we have to look at all of the determinants of health, and that, to be a good and just society, we must have laws and frameworks and policy decisions that promote better arrangements for our society and better arrangements for our natural environment as well. And that includes conservation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Cass instituted the most significant environmental legislation in the postwar period. He instituted the predecessor to today's environmental laws, a really important framework for assessing the impact that developments have on the environment. Again, it just seems like orthodoxy today: it is inevitable that we would assess the impacts of projects and development on the environment. But Dr Cass brought in this framework in the mid-1970s, and it really was the predecessor. Former Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe AO has said that Dr Cass was responsible for the most important environmental legislation in Australia's postwar period. He's been quoted as saying that. And that's right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Dr Cass was responsible not just for our domestic environmental law, for ensuring that we have in this country the right domestic settings for environmental protection, he was also a pioneer on the international stage in relation to developing international movements and international frameworks for environmental protection and conservation. I want to mention a few examples of that work. In June 1973, Dr Cass announced that the cabinet had decided that Australia would sign the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. He said: 'Cabinet's decision meant that the Customs Act and regulations would be amended so that international trade in the species will be prohibited. A decision was taken to protect a number of mammals, birds and reptile that have been designated at the conference to conclude the international convention.' So he was a leader in making sure that Australia supported this really significant international convention; and he talked about what else we could do, as a country, to demonstrate leadership in relation to species protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Cass also announced in 1974 a bilateral treaty with the Japanese government to protect migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction and their environment. That was a bilateral treaty of great significance. In fact, last week I was at a former golf course that is being turned into an environmental precinct in Victoria and the environmentalists and local government representatives there were talking to me about the Japanese snipe. So it's quite interesting to reflect that, before I was born, the first environment and conservation minister was issuing releases about what more Australia could do in a bilateral approach with Japan to protect that particular migratory bird. He was very committed to the conservation and protection of biodiversity, including those migratory birds. The significance of this is vast. I suspect he was incredibly proud that Australia became the first full party to the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. He made that announcement in May 1974, a little while after the Japanese bilateral agreement. He said, 'By signing the wetlands convention, Australia has become the first full party to it.' He noted that other nations, like Finland, Iran, the UK and several others, were close to signing it or were going to sign. This, I think, demonstrates that Dr Cass was willing to take this international leadership to really push for treaties to be a basis for environmental protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in the context of Australia becoming the first full party to that convention that there was then triggered an obligation on us as a nation to designate at least one wetland for the list to be made under that treaty, and that is how Australia came to list the Cobourg Peninsula on the Northern Territory coastline, north-west of Darwin, on that list of wetlands of international significance. As was said at the time, this was a further example of Labor's high level of activities in nature conservation, which has included enthusiastic acceptance of our international obligations. Again, this is an example of what Australia can be when it comes to environmental protection. We can be a country with domestic laws that facilitate environmental protection and conserve biodiversity. We can also, despite us not being a large country by population, be a beacon for the international community of what environmental protection can be. We can do those things. I think it would be wonderful to see the election of an Albanese Labor government that had a disposition towards Australia demonstrating leadership in the world in relation to environmental protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention Dr Cass's announcement in 1973 of a national water policy. Water policy in this country has been fraught since before Federation. There have always been struggles—I guess that would be the right word—in respect of the allocation of water, the use of water and ensuring that water is available for all of its uses, whether they be leisure, human need, environmental, cultural or agricultural. So it is incredibly significant that in 1973 Dr Cass announced a comprehensive policy statement for the future management of Australia's water resources. He said in the announcement that this was the first time there'd been an overall policy framework advanced for the future management of Australia's scarce water resources. Don't we know today how important it is to actually have a national approach? Hasn't that been demonstrated to us by the consequences of the current government's decision almost a decade ago to abolish the National Water Commission and to really vacate the field when it comes to ensuring that we have an appropriate national water policy? In 1973, when he announced this comprehensive policy statement, Dr Cass said, 'This policy statement commits the Australian government to ensuring the development of water resources will be fully integrated into the economic, social and environmental planning of the nation.' Quite a different approach, one would argue, is being adopted by the current government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention two other examples of environmental protection from Dr Cass that are of great significance to me as the shadow environment minister but also to my home state of Queensland. Firstly, I want to mention the prevention of sand mining on Fraser Island. I've got many friends who are involved in the Fraser Island Defenders Organisation—FIDO, as they're called. This was a matter of great significance to Queenslanders and to the entire nation, and it was Dr Cass who laid the groundwork and established the framework for the end of sand mining on Fraser Island. It was not done until 1976, but it was done as a result of a recommendation of the Fraser Island environmental inquiry. That inquiry had been established pursuant to section 11 of that environment protection legislation that I spoke about earlier. Decades later, Fraser Island was actually inscribed on the World Heritage List. That was a nomination from the Hawke government, and it was building on the work that Dr Cass did in the Whitlam government that allowed that to occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I want to acknowledge, and this has been acknowledged by everyone who has spoken in this debate, is that it was Dr Cass who, in the Whitlam government, established the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. That established the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to really protect and care for the entire Great Barrier Reef region. Dr Cass laid the groundwork for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. These are Whitlam government achievements and these are Dr Cass's achievements. I know that all of us in Labor are so grateful to him for the work that he did for environmental protection and for the broader work that he did for our country. We feel very deeply the loss of Dr Cass, the first environment and conservation minister not just for Labor but for the nation. We express our sincere condolences to his family, to all who loved him, to the environment protection movement. All Australians have really lost a giant.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  Two press releases from Mr Cass as Minister for the Environment and Conservation tell the House a story about what an impactful figure he was. Many press releases get issued in this building every day and few of them would be remembered 50 years later. But one press release from the Minister for the Environment and Conservation on 4 December 1973 simply started with:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Dr Cass today announced that the Government has decided to create a national park in the East Alligator River area of the Northern Territory. The park will be known as Kakadu National Park …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a significant moment, which was probably not fully appreciated at that time. Kakadu National Park had existed for hundreds of thousands of years as a pristine environment. But it was only as a result of a government decision that it was protected for every future generation. Another press release, on 23 September 1973, started:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The parliamentary draftsman has been asked to draft two major pieces of environmental legislation for the current session, the Minister for the Environment, Dr Cass, said today. These were acts incorporating the environmental impact statement procedure and a truly national system of national parks.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the environmental impact statement procedure, which we take for granted today as such a fundamental part of our environmental protections—that any big change in our urban architecture, or any development around the country, must have its environmental impact considered—only came about because of Moss Cass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people who played a role in the Labor Party having such a significant track record in relation to the environment. But none can claim a greater role than Moss Cass. His life before parliament would be enough to see him remembered. He played a significant role, as we heard in the House yesterday, in developing the first heart-lung machine. He was clearly an inventor, a man of great ingenuity. But his contribution in parliament is what we most remember. I think his role as a medico informed his passion for the environment. We see Doctors for the Environment today, and their care for country, and they see the implications of a changing climate for their patients. I think Dr Cass was very much of that mould—as you are, Mr Deputy Speaker—in seeing the impact of these changes on people. Dr Cass brought that passion to his role as Minister for the Environment and Conservation. I was struck by his statement to the first-ever OECD meeting of environment ministers. He told his international colleagues: 'We have not inherited this earth from our parents; we have borrowed it from our children.' Again, I think that summed up his approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the honourable member for Griffith alluded to, Dr Cass was a radical in radical times. The late 1960s and early 1970s were radical times, and Dr Cass did not mind being a radical in that era. But many of the views that he held and expressed have become the orthodoxy. Imagine today, as controversial as it was at the time, suggesting that there not be a national park in Kakadu, or that we shouldn't have an environmental impact statement process. Some members of the House might suggest that these days, but they would be very much in the minority. What he believed in many instances has become the orthodoxy, as it should. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He shouldn't just be remembered for his role in the environment; he played other roles. He advised Gough Whitlam and Bill Hayden about Medicare and he introduced Gough Whitlam to the fathers of Medicare. It should be noted that he had a different model than Medibank and Medicare. You'd be interested to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, he only ever believed in salaried medical officers. He did not believe in fee for service, which was not the system that was adopted in Medibank or Medicare. He was perhaps a little more radical than others, but nevertheless he could claim a role in the beginning of Medibank and Medicare. Also, after being Minister for the Environment, he went on to serve relatively briefly as Minister of the Media, which today we would call 'minister for communications'. While his time there was relatively brief, he again had an impact in that he founded community radio. Many honourable members would have participated in community radio and seen the impact of community radio in their communities—in my case 2GLF, which stands for Liverpool and Fairfield. It's been going for many years—I think from that time, as you'd know, Mr Deputy Speaker—and again Dr Cass can claim a very significant legacy there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics, for all of us, has its setbacks and its arguments. It's a matter of public record that Dr Cass and his Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, did not always see eye to eye. They had very different approaches, but that is what politics is about. It's about holding those arguments, holding your own, and winning more than you lose, ideally. Certainly, the family of Dr Cass can look back on his legacy and say he won more than he lost, and we are very grateful that he did. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To his family, their grief can be assuaged by pride in his achievements. To his widow, Shirley, his children, Naomi and Dan—I do know Dan, and I expressed my condolences to him personally—I express my condolences. To his brother Alec, who is still with us, his grandchildren and his one great-granddaughter, the House thanks them for sharing Dr Cass with the country and wishes them every condolence on the loss of their father, grandfather, great-grandfather and brother. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise to speak on this very important motion, and it has been a particular pleasure to hear the generous and heartfelt remarks of my friends the member for McMahon and the member for Griffith, which I associate myself with. Moss Cass was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life, including, of course, his very notable service to public life as a minister, as a parliamentarian and as a great and very longstanding servant of the Australian Labor Party. It was my very great privilege to have known him for almost all my time as a member of the Australian Labor Party through our shared membership of the North Carlton branch. I note that, when I first came across Moss in that branch, it was quite some time after his service in this place had come to an end. But at that stage, in the 1990s, and at all times since his activism and his idealism remained undiminished and undaunted. He was always up for the next argument, always up for the next challenge. I think it's quite remarkable, particularly when you think about such a significant record of contribution, that Moss was always looking forward and not luxuriating in the victories of the past. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I want to acknowledge here the very significant personal debt that I feel I owe to Moss, who was generous to me in a way that was far from unique. He was generous to all people he came across, although, as I think the member for McMahon noted, he had some thoughts about some of his former colleagues that he shared. But the way in which he went about his involvement post public life I found and I find quite inspirational. When I think about the opportunities that I have serving in this place as a member of our great party, I think of the example he set: the example he set while he held public office, the example he set in his activism prior to being elected and the example he continued to set throughout his long and very impactful life.  I don't know the extent to which Moss would appreciate all of the decisions I've made. From time to time he was good enough to vote for me in internal Labor Party ballots—and, as we know on this side of the House, there's no greater tribute that can be paid!—but I like to think that, in his encouragement to me, he saw something of value.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The debt that I feel, the debt that I express now, is of course absolutely nothing in comparison to his contribution. I won't go through that in great detail because we've heard eloquent testimonies to what Moss Cass meant to this country and indeed to the world's natural environment from the Leader of the Labor Party and my colleagues I referred to earlier. But, having started by referring to an extraordinary life, I feel I do need to touch upon some small elements of what would be a long highlights reel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His work as a doctor in many respects has been highlighted: as a pioneer, an inventor, someone who understood public health earlier and better than most, someone who was a key enabler—if not perhaps the architect he might have liked to have been, as the member for McMahon noted—of Medibank and Medicare, which is now such a critical element of our modern Australian social compact. He advocated for a woman's right to choose, for reproductive rights, at a time when this was very, very heavily contested not just in the community but in our party. He advocated for law reform on questions of sexuality, when again it was not always an easy fight for justice to have been a part of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, when he entered this place, his contributions were really nothing short of remarkable. He will always be our first minister for the environment and conservation. I think we could have an excellent one in this chamber right now, the member for Griffith, and I look forward hopefully to seeing her contribution in the very near future, but the standard that Moss Cass set is one that is very hard to emulate. I think it is no exaggeration to say that, in assuming that mantle, he changed our national political debate. He changed our understanding about the possibilities of national politics and our responsibility as custodians of our natural environment. The physical memories of that are significant—Kakadu and the other successful campaigns he waged—but, more particularly, it is important to dwell on the fact that he brought this discussion into the centre of this parliament and the centre of our national debate. He indeed was a leader in international forums as well. He was also Minister for the Media, briefly but—I think most of us would agree—presciently in terms of his understanding of the role that the media plays in sustaining a healthy society and a healthy democracy. His contribution in establishing community radio was something that means a lot to me and means a lot to many Australians around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond this service, which was of course sadly brought to an end as a minister, he continued in parliament for another five years. But I just want to reiterate how significant his contribution was in a very long, productive and, frankly, inspirational post-parliamentary life. I said, in acknowledging my personal debt, that it was far from unique—Moss was incredibly generous with his experience and his encouragement. He was full of ideas, full of enthusiasm and never let slip the notion that there is a better world out there if we have the wit and the will to make it. When I think about Moss and his impact on me, his impact on our party and his impact on our country, those are the guiding words that I hope can sustain me and my colleagues and all of us in this place as we go about the work that we are so privileged to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thoughts today and since his passing are with his family, with Shirley and his children, Naomi and Dan, and all of those whose lives were shaped by Moss, all of those who loved him, all of us who walk in his shadow. Rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  The Whitlam government changed Australia and it encapsulated the spirit of the 1960s. And no-one did that better than Moss Cass. Long haired, bearded and described by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Jewish News</span> as 'with it', he was happy to invite colleagues to smoke pot in his office when they critiqued Australia's drug policy. He was somebody who didn't always get on with the Prime Minister. He carried with him the same drive and passion as his parents, who'd fled the anti-Jewish pogroms in tsarist Russia. He was a trailblazer in the area of the environment. He was frustrated at the timidity of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which was then chaired by Sir Garfield Barwick and whose patron was Prince Philip. He was an activist in the environmental area, effectively managing to stop sand mining on Fraser Island—an outrage that, when you go to Fraser Island today, you cannot believe ever occurred—and curtailing the Ranger Uranium Mine in Kakadu. He began that process of turning the Labor Party into Australia's leading environmental party, which it remains today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a doctor, he attained significant note. He built the first heart-lung machine in Australia. He brought back from his time in London with his wife, Shirley Shulman, a sense of free thinking and a willingness to challenge authority. We in the ACT acknowledge Moss for his sponsorship of private members' bills that legalised abortion and decriminalised homosexuality in the ACT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is also his important work in the media portfolio. As the Leader of the Opposition noted in the House, he initiated Double J and got rid of the television licence fee. He also put in place the Press Council, though not without some critique. When he initially proposed the notion of a press council, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sunday Telegraph</span> talked about it as 'a real threat to democracy, and a monstrous pre-empting of the judicial system'. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> editorialised: 'What country are we living in? It sounds more like Dr Goebbels's Nazi Germany than Dr Cass's Australia.' Others noted at the time that, if anything demonstrated the need for a press council, it was those distorted responses to the proposals for a press council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Moss didn't stop when his political career ended. He continued corresponding with a range of members of parliament, including, I'm pleased to say, me. An email that he sent me on 26 September 2021 said: 'For the survival of democracy, it is essential that opinions and assertions be supported by established, confirmed data readily available for everyone through the media.' He went on to make a range of observations about the work that he'd done and the importance of conducting a fact based debate in politics. As the cliche goes, you can have your own views but not your own facts. Yet too often today we've forgotten the lesson Moss Cass taught us about the importance of a robust, ideas based political conversation. Moss Cass's email of 26 September 2021 finished with this sentence: 'If you have reached this far and feel like objecting or commenting, please do so by email. I am now too deaf, at the age of 94, to follow a phone conversation.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote back to him to simply say: 'Moss, thank you. I appreciate your views. I will do my best to ensure that we have that vibrant democracy that you worked for.' By golly, I hope that, like Moss Cass, when I'm in my 90s I'll be engaging with policymakers to try to make the world a better place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  On 25 February 2022 we lost a giant of Australian political history, Moss Cass. Following the pogroms, his Jewish grandparents fled Bialystok in 1906 seeking safety for their family in Western Australia, where they found it, and Moss was later born in Narrogin. Moss was a medical scientist by training. He was a registrar at major hospitals and a medical researcher who built Australia's first heart-lung machine. He was a politician for many years, and he was also a conservationist at heart. He loved the environment, in his own garden and beyond. He kept bees. He talked about sustainability and intergenerational equity long before it was common to do so. He understood the climate crisis better than anyone. He eschewed Comcars in favour of riding a bike to parliament. He hated waste. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He first ran against Robert Menzies in Kooyong in 1961. His radical platform took more votes off the Liberal Prime Minister than anyone before. Buoyed by the idea that people responded to vision, honesty and openness, he ran twice more and was, ultimately, elected as the member for Maribyrnong in 1969 and was appointed Minister for the Environment and Conservation in 1972. He secured passage of the first national environmental assessment law: Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a politician, Moss Cass never shied away from the grunt work of policy development, of bold decisions, hard conversations and vigorous debates, of listening to the community and getting things done. He helped overturn the white Australia policy and helped get Labor to oppose the Vietnam War. He was instrumental in the design of universal healthcare. He fought against the flooding of Lake Pedder and worked towards ending sandmining on Fraser Island and securing protection for the Great Barrier Reef. He funded community radio. He advocated decriminalising cannabis, legalising abortion, law reforms to ensure gay men and women were not discriminated against and for stopping public money going to wealthy private schools. He thought that a country's success should be measured by the wellbeing of its citizens, not just its GDP. As his son, Dan Cass, said in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Saturday Paper</span>, 'Moss could imagine a green and fair world and did as much as anyone to bring it about. He taught us that collaborative thinking is what we do. To live is to work it all out: how to care for each other and the planet.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss attributed his political achievements as evidence for what Dan calls his 'science of hope'. Radical honesty wins votes; power only matters if you do something bold. I was lucky enough to meet Moss Cass briefly early on in my term, and since then have had more sustained engagement with his Melbourne based family over the years. On behalf of the Australian Greens, I offer my thanks to Moss Cass for the groundwork he laid for environmental and social justice reforms in this country. My condolences to his family and friends for their loss, to Dan, Shirley and Naomi, and also to the broader Labor Party movement who will no doubt be feeling this loss keenly as well. On behalf of the Australian Greens, we will remember Moss Cass.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURN</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">S</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I rise to speak on this condolence motion for the honourable Dr Moses Henry Cass, better known as Moss. Moss Cass served in this House from 1969 to 1983. He left parliament four years before I was born. I never had the privilege of meeting him, but when I was elected to this place in 2019 I was the 22nd Jewish Australian elected to our federal parliament. Moss was the eighth. He was elected in 1969 with a new generation of Jewish MPs together with Barry Cohen, Joe Berinson and Dick Klugman. The three of them would go on to be ministers in Labor governments. Moss Cass was buried in the Batalum Cemetery in Springvale, near where my grandmother is buried. So we do have a shared history, and I'm proud to have this with Moss Cass. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was one of the generation of new, young Labor MPs who came to this House in 1969 as part of the wave of enthusiasm for the new Labor leader Gough Whitlam. One of his fellow new MPs in the class of '69 was a young man named Paul Keating. As a doctor and director of the Trade Union Clinic and Research Centre, Moss Cass was enthused by Whitlam's determination to reform Australia's ramshackle health insurance system. As a son of Jewish refugees, he was a champion of human rights and for a more liberal immigration policy. He was an early campaigner for environmental activism, for abortion law reform and for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. He used his first speech to argue for the decriminalisation of abortion. With the late Sir John Gorton, he co-sponsored a motion in this House supporting decriminalisation of homosexuality well before this cause was adopted by the political mainstream. He was fiercely progressive and he was a trailblazer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, his campaign manager at the time when he first came in suggested a good line: 'I don't mind who you vote for, as long as you think about it'. As the voters of Maribyrnong have never elected a Liberal MP since, no doubt Moss Cass helped turn that seat red.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss Cass went on to be a very fine and visionary minister for the environment and conservation, Australia's first ever Minister for Environment in the visionary Whitlam government. He passed the environmental protection act in 1974, despite some opposition both internally and externality. It was a bold idea well ahead of it time but it got through. Moss cared for our environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss Cass had a turbulent time in politics. He fell out with Gough Whitlam and was shunted out of the environment portfolio. He was the shadow health minister under Bill Hayden but was dropped from the front bench after the 1980 election. His views on many subjects were too leftist even for the Left of that time, though, mostly, they would be pretty uncontroversial now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He chose to retire in 1983 when he was only 56. He went on to have a second career at the Melbourne university's Melbourne School of Land Environment and chaired the Australian National Biocentre. In many ways, he was a man ahead of his time, and he paid a price for that. But he deserves to be remembered as a pioneer of many good causes and a champion of progressive Labor policies and values. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister and Assistant Minister for Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  On Sunday 27 March it was wet in my community. We'd had a lot of rain over the previous week, with heavy falls forecast over the next 24 hours. We're used to floods. Most homes are built above the one-in-100-year levels of 12.2 metres. Shops have their flood plans. Everyone moves their stock, their machinery, to flood-free levels. Everyone was preparing. We know how to do floods. The Bureau of Meteorology, as people were going to bed, were predicting a peak of 11.5 metres. That's under the 12.2-metre record levels. People were confident they were prepared and safe in their houses. In the early morning hours, people started to get awoken by water coming into their houses. The flood level had been revised to 14.5 metres, three metres higher than when people were going to bed. This is 2.3 metres higher than we'd ever seen before. We did not have a flood happening; we had a natural disaster happening which we had never seen or experienced before, all in the dark of night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The immediate crisis was that thousands of people were at risk of drowning in their homes. People were scrambling into roof cavities and onto roofs. It was a desperate situation. Then they arrived, instinctively, intuitively: over 200 local heroes got into their tinnies, kayaks and jet skis and started rescuing people and saving their neighbours' lives. Make no mistake: they were putting themselves at great risk. This was a swollen, angry river. The storm was still raging, and rain was falling heavily. But out they went, saving person after person, family after family. Four fatalities happened that day, all tragic. It was a miracle there were so few. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Besides the 200 local heroes, the SES and other first responders like the police, Fire and Rescue and others all did amazing things. I made urgent calls before daybreak to get ADF support to help with evacuations. They arrived that morning and assisted, which was crucial. Evacuation centres instantaneously sprang up. Around 10,000 people were going to be homeless by the end of the day. Lismore, Coraki, Woodburn, Broadwater and Wardell all have this same story—heroes saving lives, heroes setting up evacuation centres. Some of the evacuation centres had no outside support for days as they were stranded by floodwaters. Hundreds of people I could name here right now deserve recognition for what they did, and I'm going to ensure they all do get the recognition they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three to four days later, on the Thursday, the floodwaters started to recede, to the point where supplies started to arrive into our towns. The ADF could get in with their larger equipment to help with the clean-up—over 4,000 of them—and we thank them. Also, the floodwaters receding revealed the devastation. This wasn't going to be a clean-up; this was going to be a rebuild. People had lost everything in their homes and businesses. Places in supposedly flood-free areas were wiped out. People weren't going to open their businesses in days; it was going to be weeks and months. People who had homes flooded will not be going back into their homes for weeks, if not months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government we declared category A, B and D disaster in record time. Many packages have been announced to help families, business and farmers. Financial support has started—over $1 billion already—but much, much more still needs to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The clean-up, after four weeks, even with 4,000 ADF helpers, is only 50 per cent complete. We are all traumatised. No-one is sleeping properly. Those who nearly drowned are having nightmares. Those who saved them are having nightmares. Mental health services are arriving, and we will need them—and more. Financial packages will encourage some to restart; some will decide not to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over $200 million has already been announced, to do flood modelling and work on flood mitigation. We can never flood-proof our town, but we can and must do more on flood mitigation for us to rebuild with confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, overnight we have been flooded again. The levy has been overtopped and we will be going to 12 metres today. This has triggered more trauma in my community for those who nearly drowned and those who saved them just four weeks ago, reliving the flooding rains and the evacuations again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love my town. We will come back, but it is going to take us time. We are going to have to help our neighbours and our friends to stand again, one day at a time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I pay tribute to the member for Page and the incredible work that he has done, looking after his local residents. This has placed incredible stress not only on him but on his staff as well. I think all members who have represented flooded communities know just how lucky we are to have our brilliant staff, with the incredible hours that they are putting in. It takes a toll on them. And today I want to start my remarks by recognising all of the collective efforts from our staff, who have been guiding and supporting our residents. I recognise the member for Page and the member for Richmond for their incredible service to their constituents, and I know the member for Richmond has returned to her electorate today to deal with even further flooding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But my focus has been on the people in my electorate who have been absolutely devastated by the recent floods. I've helped people clear out their homes and businesses. When you've carried the last of a person's beloved belongings out onto the street and left them on the kerb to be picked up like trash, it becomes painfully clear that the $1,000 is just a mere drop in the ocean compared to what these people and families have lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, I came to Canberra with the goal of fighting for them, and advocating for them at every opportunity. I've just recently left question time, where I demanded to know from the Prime Minister why my local residents have been treated like second-class citizens compared to other citizens across Australia who have been equally flooded. They deserve more than they are getting from this government—a government that has decided, for whatever reason, that they are not as worthy of support as flood victims just over the border in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real support for these people didn't come from the federal government; it came from our community. The response of locals to this crisis has made me incredibly proud to be the federal member for Oxley. Together, we did our best to make sure no-one was left behind, whether it was Tony from Middle Park Bakery keeping the free barbecues stocked with fresh bread or Big Pappa's Pizza at Camira offering free pizza for flood victims. People reached out a helping hand to those in need, without hesitation. Baby Give Back, a local charity based in my electorate, has ensured that families with children have had the resources to protect and nurture them throughout the past few weeks. People like Pastor Phil Kennedy from the Shiloh Church and his congregation packed hampers of donated goods for those who were living without power, and the Riverlife Baptist Church opened their doors to anyone who needed a place as the floodwaters rose. Just last week, Aaron from the Kerwick Hotel put on an afternoon of beers and celebration for the volunteers and flood victims who had stood side-by-side, rebuilding our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge again Thiess Mining, who set up a free barbecue at the Goodna recovery centre for flood victims and volunteers. Listen to these stats: 3,000 drinks; 6,000 litres of cleaning product; 3½ thousand hot meals; 150 kilograms of sausages—these were from one company, Thiess Mining. I want to thank the CEO, Michael Wright, for his generosity in ensuring that residents, particularly those in the Goodna part of my electorate, were looked after, and Phil Woods from Thiess Mining, who was there every day to ensure that the operations were running as smoothly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, the crisis brought out the very best in our community, as locals stepped up to take on leadership roles to help their neighbours and to keep everyone's morale high. Dan, known in the Goodna community as 'Dan the Mill Street Man', set up a pop-up recovery hub on Mill Street, one of the most impacted streets in Goodna. People like Frank and Winghy made the devastating reality of the floods just that little bit more bearable with their can-do attitude and humour. I consider myself incredibly blessed to have worked alongside them in the recovery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also worked hand in hand with a fantastic team of local representatives. Our local state representatives, Lance McCallum, Jess Pugh and Charis Mullen, were all amazing advocates of flood affected communities throughout the crisis and were by my side every day. The Goodna-Ipswich City Council, made up of the fantastic mayor, Mayor Teresa Harding, the local councillors for the flood affected suburbs in my electorate, the deputy mayor, Councillor Nicole Jonic, and the brilliant Councillor Paul Tully, a councillor with over 40 years of local government experience, provided invaluable support to Goodna residents. These representatives were on the ground every single day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the floodwaters come, they're not blue or red; they're brown. This is not a political speech I'm giving today. It's simply a realisation that when the floodwaters rise or when natural disasters come, we have to come together as one community. That's also why today I want to recognise the LNP councillor for the Jamboree Ward in my electorate, Councillor Sarah Hutton, for her outstanding leadership. She was an incredible resource for the constituents in the Centenary Suburbs, and I pay tribute to all of her hard work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are of course too many businesses and people to mention, but I'm going to give it a go: Terry Slaughter from the Springfield Lakes IGA; the Pepper Lounge at Jindalee; St Alban's church and Anglicare Southern Queensland; the Buddhist Vihara at Goodna; White Lies Brewing; the 4074 Community &amp; Beyond page; the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association; Orange Sky; Dr Cuong Bui AM and the Vietnamese community, Queensland chapter; the Pioneer baseball club; Springfield City Group, in particular Raynuha Sinnathamby, who I called when I was in desperate need of wheelbarrows and squeegees. They are the peak commodity during a flood. Forget diamonds and jewels; it is wheelbarrows and squeegees! In our time of need when we were desperate for wheelbarrows, I rang Raynuha Sinnathamby and said, 'Can you help me?' and, within an hour, 11 wheelbarrows turned up. Others included the Springfield Panthers rugby league football club; Wolston Park Centenary Cricket Club; Lyndons Pty Ltd; Storage Choice Sumner Park; 4 Voices; Oxley Uniting Church; Forest Lake Uniting Church; the Rotary Club of Jindalee; CWA Oxley; and Goodna Street Life and their amazing outreach team, particularly Helen Youngberry for not just all of her brilliant work during the flood crisis but her amazing efforts looking after those in need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, over the past few days we've seen even more rain across the electorate. While serious flooding has not eventuated, the sense of anxiety that locals felt was palpable, even all the way down here in Canberra. We're now living with the reality that these sorts of disasters can occur with alarming frequency, and every time it rains people now have to worry. We're seeing that play out all too clearly in New South Wales as we speak. The floodwaters are once again rising in Lismore and Byron Bay. This crisis will repeat itself, and the fact that we are talking about this even a month later is unimaginable. Yet, this is the reality for many of our brothers and sisters in the Northern Rivers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My heart goes out to the communities that once again have had to flee their homes, unsure of when they'll be able to return or what they'll return to. But what this crisis shows is that we do need real investment, in a bipartisan way, in not only recovery but mitigation. It's unimaginable that, on the eve of an election, we aren't making this a central point of the major parties. It's something that I'll be advocating for inside my own party, to make sure that we are leading from the front, and I encourage members on the opposite to talk to your leadership, to talk to your party leaders. We need to find common solutions to deal with these unmitigated disasters. We want to make sure that disaster recovery and the rebuilding happens as quickly as possible. Australians know that they need solutions, and they need answers for these problems now. That's why I'm really pleased that a future Albanese Labor government will revamp the failed ERF to create the new Disaster Ready Fund—$200 million to be invested in disaster readiness to protect lives and livelihoods. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to make this point: one of the most chilling aspects during the flood crisis was the intervention from Shane Stone. I was standing with residents in Goodna when I was alerted to the fact that Mr Stone made the irresponsible comment that if you live in a flood plain it's your fault. That is not acceptable. I did not hear at all from Mr Stone during the natural disaster. I'm not sure what his role is during recovery from natural disasters, but if these well-paid fat cats are going to sit from the sidelines on comfortable couches when people's homes are inundated let's have the discussion after not during the time of natural disaster. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locals in my electorate have lost everything, and the poor people of northern New South Wales are once again seeing their homes go under water. We need solutions put on the table to mitigate and help rebuild as quickly as possible. I am hopeful that—whoever wins government—we will see real flood and disaster mitigation work happen so that people in my community will not have to experience the trauma of these floods again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish on this note. Our community is stronger than ever before because of these floods. We never wanted them, but our community came together like never before. As the people's representative in the electorate of Oxley, I couldn't be prouder of the community that I represent. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I commend the member for Oxley for his words, for his advocacy for his constituency, and I observe the passion he had for Frank, a constituent in his electorate who has lost his house. He mentioned him in question time today. He read the thank you list like a Melbourne Cup caller because he had so many of them. I know that he's passionate about his electorate and he's grateful for the work done by so many people. They do it without wanting recognition. They do it without wanting acknowledgement. They do it because they love their fellow human beings. They do it for strangers. That's the Australian way. Thank you, Member for Oxley, for those words. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge too the former member for Maranoa, who has just joined us in the chamber, and his work with the Royal Flying Doctor Service, an institution in this country that has saved many, many lives in regional Australia. I acknowledge the former member for Maranoa Bruce Scott for his work post-parliament. Indeed, he was a fine member of parliament, but what he's done post-parliament is something to be admired and respected. Thank you, Bruce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The devastation, destruction and despair we've witnessed in South-East Queensland and, particularly, the Northern Rivers in northern New South Wales as a result of the recent floods is almost indescribable. During my time as Deputy Prime Minister, I vividly recall having toured flood ravaged areas across this nation. The heart-wrenching images stay with you. The loss of life, livestock, pets, homes and livelihoods is unfathomable, all at the hands of Mother Nature. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more recently, in my own electorate of Riverina, I joined the Prime Minister and New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet to survey damage to properties, homes and businesses in the Central West of New South Wales, when floods flowed through Forbes, Bedgerabong and other neighbouring areas. I know, from speaking with farmers and small-business owners who were hit hard by those floods, that the losses incurred are more than just bricks and mortar. It's the toll the loss has on those people's ability to want to keep going and the hit to their resilience, the hit to their pride. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, like those people who the member of Oxley thanked, these are tough Australians. These are Australians who are not afraid to get in and have a go. They're not going to let a flood deter them from doing what they do for their own families, for their own communities and for those strangers they might have a chance meeting with at a time of disaster. Humans can only take so much, but they get back up when they get knocked down, and they get back up again and again. It's like that song with the words, 'I get knocked down but I get up again.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in times of disaster faced by my own communities that we saw a flourishing of grassroots support, this neighbourly support that we see all so often in Australians. Whether it's floods, as we've experienced recently, or bushfires, no matter what calamity strikes, you can be sure that you can rely on your neighbours in the worst of times. Of course, you can also rely on those wonderful first responders: police, ambulance, fire officers, state emergency services. They are just magnificent people. They help to save livestock. They save property and they assist with the recovery and clean-up. They save human lives. The same power and the human spirit that I witnessed in my electorate, we're seeing again and again at the moment in the Northern Rivers and in Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member Page for his speech just before the member for Oxley and for his advocacy. I commend the state member, Janelle Saffin, as well for what she has done. She's a former member of this place. I also commend the member for Richmond, with whom I drove yesterday to parliament and we had a good chat. I phoned her during the height of the crisis to see how she was faring. I've got a high regard for her and I've got a huge amount of respect for the member for Page. I saw him at his best when the crisis was at its worst. I commend him, the member for Richmond and other members, and I certainly commend the newly minted New South Wales Minister for Emergency Services and Resilience, Steph Cooke, the member for Cootamundra. She has taken on that role after fulfilling a role in regional health. Dealing with COVID was very hard, and she's gone from dealing with that to dealing with this crisis. She's holding up well and doing a good job, and I know she'll continue to do that for and on behalf of regional constituents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important we reflect on the impact of the floods and how, as a nation and as a community, we band together to support those who have been impacted as they face the fear of what might lie ahead in the days to come and again are on alert with more flood warnings being issued overnight. We stand by our colleagues and we stand by those people who are in harm's way. We've all witnessed the inspiring images through the media coverage: the nightly television bulletins with people on their jet skis and in their tinnies saving others. We've also got the Australian Defence Force. How magnificent are our ADF personnel who come to the aid of those people, and we thank them. Seeing people rescuing others from rooftops in their tinnies or their kayaks, moving livestock or providing warm meals and support is quite heartwarming, and it goes to the Australian way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does alarm me, it does concern me, that some use this as political opportunism. I appreciate that they're devastated, but to then go and dump household rubbish at Kirribilli, I do wonder about their motives. I appreciate that climate change is something that is very near and dear to people's hearts, but I do wonder about the motivation of those people when, in these worst of times, they use that as a means to make a political point. We can be better than that and we need to be better than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend those people who work in government departments for getting the assistance out the door as quickly as they could. Yes, there'll always be criticism. Yes, because of computer systems and other bureaucratic processes, sometimes some people do slip through the cracks. Rest assured, I know that if those people feel that they have missed out, there are avenues by which they can get that much needed assistance. Thank you to those public servants who do what they can to adjust as quickly as possible and amend those people's assistance measures, if they have missed out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also goes to the heart of mitigation, and that is why I am a supporter of making sure that we build the levee banks in the right place and making sure that we build water infrastructure in the right place, not just to help communities stricken by floods over and over again but, indeed, to ensure that we store the water so that we can grow agriculture. There's a win-win here; there's a double-bonus here. I look at Wyangala dam—not that this is the right motion to be pushing water infrastructure to grow agriculture—and raising the Wyangala dam wall would help Forbes, which has been flooded many, many times over the past 100 years. Indeed, we want, at all costs and efforts, to avoid these unnecessary floods because the right infrastructure in the right places could help those communities right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, we cannot stop Mother Nature, but we can work together to support each other in these times of darkness and despair, because it's the generosity of community and human spirit which shines through in these times of natural disasters. At the worst of times you see the best in people; you truly do, whether it's the SES or whether it's strangers you may never bump into again who help people out. I can't thank them enough. The government stands by and is willing and ready to assist those impacted by the devastating floods now and into the future, as the floodwaters recede—and hopefully they are receding and we won't see, as some might suggest, future downpours like those affecting the poor communities in and around Lismore. Again, I commend the member for Page for his courage in sticking up for his constituents.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I commend you,  Deputy Speaker Falinski, for your Red Cross badge. I rise to speak on indulgence in response to the Prime Minister's statement on the recent floods in South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales. The catastrophic floods that enveloped South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales in February and March have been described as one of Australia's worst-ever natural disasters. In Queensland alone, 13 lives were lost, and I send my sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives. Twelve suburbs in my electorate of Moreton were inundated in late February. About 2,200 homes had water over their floorboards, numerous businesses have been destroyed or have had havoc wreaked upon them, families have lost precious possessions collected over a lifetime, and the trauma will linger for ages, coming back every time it rains hard, as it has again this week. When lows return many will feel low again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community has been through this before. There was the famous 1974 deluge, and then, in my time as an MP, the 2011 floods hit my community very hard. Sadly, some families that were flooded way back in 2011 are again facing heartbreak, clean-up and rebuilding. I know my community is resilient; I know they'll pull through this and rebuild their homes and their lives, but it's tough, it's challenging and it's draining. In fact, it's much slower than the floodwaters are draining away in some cases. I'd like to thank the wonderful community groups in Moreton who immediately swung into action. They learnt from 2011. They set up pop-up evacuation centres for families—places where they could also take their pets, which can be a challenge. They provided shelter, they provided electricity to charge phones—crucial in this digital age—they provided meals, they provided comfort and they provided a helping hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll mention some of those groups who stepped up: the Yeronga Community Centre, who did incredible work; Wellers Hill Bowls Club, before they were sadly shut down by the Brisbane City Council; the Corinda Bowls Club; The Clubhouse at Moorooka; Dewar's Refrigeration at Rocklea, who was just a business who allowed the use of their business facility, their business site, to operate as a relief hub; the Graceville Presbyterian Church; the Tzu Chi Buddhist Compassion Relief Foundation, who I particularly call out because they literally handed over cheques or money to people, as well as other forms of support; Moorooka Lions; the Archerfield Rotary Club; the Lions Club of Ekibin; parents and students from St Laurence's who pitched in; Yeronga Park swimming centre; Dunlop Park Memorial Swimming Pool; the Oxley Senior Citizens; Lou Bromley from Oxley; Jackie Holyoake from Salisbury; Life Church; Synergy Education; Bangladesh Puja Cultural Society Inc. of Brisbane; Orange Sky; Sundays Cafe—thank you, Anthony; St Thomas More Facebook group; Rocklea Facebook group; Lyne Rowe; Desley Griffiths from Sandlewood; and so many other unnamed people who donated goods, food and money and turned up to help. I especially acknowledge the elected representatives, Brisbane City councillors Nicole Johnston and Steve Griffiths, and state MPs Mark Bailey, Jess Pugh and Peter Russo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dealing with any crisis is tough. Dealing with a flood is really challenging. It's dirty, it's smelly and it's heartbreaking. In 2011, when Prime Minister Julia Gillard ensured that there were Centrelink workers on the ground almost immediately, like the next day, to help people apply for their disaster payments, it was crucial to turning people's lives around. I remember those Commonwealth workers, wearing their teal shirts—this was before Independents ran in elections, I guess!—and helping locals to access payments right there, right then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Disappointingly, in 2022, that wasn't the case. It took five days to get anyone from a Morrison government department into Moreton. The Morrison government actually expected people from flooded Chelmer and Graceville to somehow row and drive to Chandler, 25 kilometres away. I'll point out that there are three Centrelink sites in Longman. Taking nothing from the people of Longman, but there are none in Moreton, Griffiths, Oxley or Rankin. All of those four seats are represented by Labor people. It was only after much lobbying from me that finally Services Australia workers were sent into some of the community centres in Moreton to help on a face-to-face basis, because—guess what?—internet towers were down and phones weren't charged. I do thank those Services Australia workers, many of whom I met. They've been so helpful to my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011, I vividly remember the ADF arriving to help almost immediately—the night of the flood, in fact. I remember reservists and all sorts were out there the night of the flood. In 2022, it took many days before any ADF personnel arrived in Moreton. In fact, on my journey throughout Moreton, I noted a stark contrast between the Commonwealth government support for locals in 2011 and in 2022. That's disappointing. It's a symptom of a bigger problem with this coalition government. They are not there when we need them. They are there for the photo-op with a broom, but when it comes to giving genuine support they're missing in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many locals have been disappointed to not be given the financial support they thought would be forthcoming. The minister makes the rules about who is eligible for the disaster recovery payment. In 2022, the eligibility rules were much tougher than in 2011. Lauren from Rocklea had no power for six days, which meant all her food was gone, her back fence was damaged as it was used to evacuate other residents, her house has mould from the water and tools in her shed were destroyed. But Lauren's application for the disaster recovery payment has been rejected twice. David, again from Rocklea, has four children. Theirs is a single-income family. He's had three metres of water through his property. They're living upstairs in the flooded property. David said he had tried to tell his neighbours it was serious, but there were no official warnings. Yuri and his mother also live in Rocklea. Yuri says the message to move out was too late. I know, because I live in Moorooka, next to Rocklea, and we got it late on the Sunday night. Yuri's mother is staying on the property in a tent and is worried about more rain. Lacey from Oxley will not be able to move back to her house for six to 12 months. The water reached the roof line. She is living with other family members. Felicity and Keith are long-term residents of Chelmer. They were previously flooded in 2011. They want to raise their home so they don't get flooded again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The residents of Inskip Street, Rocklea, watched the waters rising up on Saturday night. They looked on the internet and the TV for warnings but there were none, so they went to bed. Luckily one neighbour had to go to work early and had set his alarm for 4 am. When the alarm went off, he stepped out of his bed into a river of water. In 2022, there was no warning. Out on the street, the water was rising fast. Cars were submerged. Residents tried to save what they could. What the residents of Inskip Street can't understand is why there wasn't any warning until late on the Sunday night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland government, last year, requested the Commonwealth fund an upgrade to the flood warning infrastructure network as a priority, a request that was refused. The government's $4 billion disaster recovery mitigation recovery fund is sitting untouched, earning interest but not doing anything for disaster recovery or mitigation. Not one cent has been spent from the fund. Australians are going through really tough times. We've had the pandemic, we've had fires and we've had floods. They have faced disaster after disaster, and they deserve a government that will support them, a government that will make sure that we are prepared for the next flood—because it is coming—and the one after that and the one after that. We know that we are going to face more frequent and more severe disasters because of climate change. There! I said the words: climate change. They are not difficult words to face; it's the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the sticky, dark mud, the stinking water or the smashed up and sodden piles of belongings of people's lives stacked on footpaths that stay with me in the aftermath of my community again facing a flood situation. Those phenomena are memorable, but what stays closest to my heart is how our community always comes together to help out others. That is what I hold dear. The people of Moreton were magnificent in all 12 suburbs that were inundated. That's what inspires me to keep fighting for them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIM</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">MONDS</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I rise today to speak about some of our heroes of the 2022 floods in the electorate of Ryan. I was in my community in the 2011 flood event as well. It was difficult to see many of the same people who had gone through the earlier flood event going through it again in 2022. The electorate is diverse and people were affected in different ways. The communities of Moggill, Bellbowrie, Pullenvale and Brookfield were cut off by floodwater for a number of days. People in Fig Tree Pocket, Indooroopilly, St Lucia, Toowong and Auchenflower were inundated by the river as well as by the rising creek levels. People in The Gap, and further afield in Mitchelton, were inundated by fast flowing creek water while the rain was falling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter how residents were affected, they have shown tremendous spirit and resilience. It has been a sincere pleasure, during my time as the member for Ryan, to be able to join them in their community spirit as they seek to rally around those residents who have been badly affected by the flood. In doing so, I want to pay testament to some of those community members who went above and beyond the call of duty for their fellow residents during the flood. I put out the call to the community to ask them to nominate people who had particularly assisted them but perhaps hadn't sought any credit. Of course, they don't do it for the recognition, but they rightly deserve it all the same. These were people who saw a need and, rather than waiting for somebody else to do it, simply pitched in and got it done themselves. So I would like to acknowledge a few of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, there is Damian Reynoldson. He is described by his neighbours as a family man and a quiet achiever. He has a friendly and compassionate nature, with many practical skills. With the support of his wife, Christie, Damian became known as 'the Witton Island hero.' His skills supported and enabled many in the flood-affected Witton Road-Twigg Street area to deal with the challenges thrown at them. For a time, as you can imagine from the name 'Witton Island hero', their little part of the world, those two streets, became an island cut off from the rest of the community, with floodwaters all around them. Moving furniture; getting essential supplies by boat; cleaning with pressure cleaners, shovels and brooms; and providing portable generators for power—the list goes on and on. These were some of the things that Damian was able to procure and assist his fellow residents with. Congratulations and thank you, Damian, the hero of Witton Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to Anthony 'Herbie' Herbert. Herbie mobilised the blue and green army of GPS players, juniors and their parents to pitch in and help residents affected by the Enoggera Creek flooding. Herbie's fellow residents said he 'seemed to be everywhere'. He was carting around possessions out on the footpath, manning hoses, emptying pools of their mud—he told me he became quite an expert at this, unfortunately—and reassuring people that this was the worst part and, from now on, it was going to get better because they were all working together to chip in, piece by piece. He was there from first light until well after dark each day and until the job was done. So, well done to Herbie and all of those GPS players who went out to assist their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now to Shane Ehrhardt. Will lives on Macquarie Street in St Lucia, which is notorious for flooding. His property was flooded on the Sunday, leaving him no way to leave. But, thankfully, his apartment was still above the waterline when he went to bed that night. On Monday morning, with the water still rising towards his apartment, he had no choice but to evacuate. But the SES, as you can imagine, was busy helping others whose homes were currently being flooded. So Will and his family had a few hours of nervous waiting, watching the water continuing to rise and feeling helpless. Will's work colleague Shane suddenly appeared, coming to the rescue on their back stairs. He was climbing out of his own kayak that he had paddled to the apartment, holding a thermos of coffee. Will said that he had to hold tears back as he saw Shane. While Will and his family prepared their belongings to paddle out, Shane, not content with the rescue that he was already undertaking, popped out to rescue a pregnant woman and her partner who had called for help. After Shane came back and took Will and his family to safety, he then calmly got back into his kayak and paddled off. Shane ended up spending about five continuous hours on the Monday finding strangers in Macquarie Street in St Lucia who needed help, leading them and their belongings onto the kayak and paddling them out. Will said, 'Shane is a private person and would die if he knew I was writing about him here.' Well, goodness knows what Shane thinks of me reading him into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>! Will said: 'I bet he didn't even tell most of his friends what he did that day. He is my hero and probably a hero to many who met him for the first time in his kayak and will never see him again. Thank you, Shane.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nathan Purcell is a young electrician with a new business, but he didn't hesitate to jump in by helping neighbours in his area to clean up or by doing countless electricity checks so that people could plug in gernies and fridges. Residents would mention a friend down the road who had lost power, and Nathan would be there within five minutes to check the electricity so that they could get their power back on and they could get back on with their lives and the clean-up. Thank you for your efforts, Nathan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brad Colliss, the owner of the local Bellbowrie fruit shop, kayaked across a cut off road to his own shop to open it up, even though the shopping centre itself had lost power. Customers who didn't have cash on them—there was no power so there was no EFTPOS—were told they could pay later, or, if they were struggling with the flood, to just take the food that was there. This spurred on an incredible sense of community spirit that saw people paying it forward and leaving extra money to help others. Wendy nominated Brad and said: 'I know in the scheme of things this is only a small event while people lost their homes, but it certainly contributed to people's good mental health in sad times.'  Well done Brad, and thank you for giving away your product. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dan 'The Tinnie Man' Hill acquired the name The Tinny Man because he spent a number of days using his own tinnie and his own fuel to ferry stranded community members across Moggill Road when it was cut off. His efforts reunited families, got people to important medical appointments, got essential hospital workers to their shifts and delivered essential medicines and supplies. When I met Dan out on Moggill Road, at the time we was taking aged-care workers across in his tinny, so they could cook and care for those at the RSL home at Pinjarra Hills who had been cut off by the flood. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, I would like to thank the SES western group and all of the SES workers in the Ryan electorate. The 40 volunteers of the SES western group based in Toowong completed over 1,100 hours of service to the local community between them during the flooding event. Members assisted and volunteered their time for initial sandbagging and flood mitigation response, completed temporary repairs and evacuated residents who had been inundated—all while their own depot was going underwater. It was an absolutely extraordinary effort. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a few of the local 2022 flood heroes who have been nominated by their own community—by those they helped—because their efforts just meant so much to so many people, and I am so very proud of our community. I know what the community went through was horrible and will stay with people for a long time. But it should also stay with us that those residents rallied around each other and pitched in where they could. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, I would like to thank the ADF and those members of the Defence Force who came out of Gallipoli Barracks in the electorate of Ryan to help others, particularly with the clean-up around St Lucia, Auchenflower and Toowong. The way they turned up in such great numbers day after day, to break the back of some of the most gruelling work meant an awful lot. A lot of them were sacrificing time away from their families. A lot of them had their own homes affected by flood, but they put that to one side so they could do their job and help others. Such is the spirit of our ADF. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the hardest time is not the flood; it's not even the initial clean-up, because there are a lot of people around then. We learnt that in 2011. The hardest time is when everybody has gone and residents, all of a sudden, find themselves by themselves with an uninhabitable home, trying to rebuild their lives. I want to remind them that we are here for them all the time if they need anything at all. There are plenty of people in our community willing to help. I encourage them to reach out, and I will stay in touch with them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  Communities in my electorate were also among those affected by the deluge and the floods at the end of February and the beginning of March this year. Homes and businesses in Hill End, West End, South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Norman Park, Coorparoo, Stones Corner, Hawthorn, Bulimba, Morningside and other areas were all affected by the rain bomb, as it's been called, and by the floods that followed. I want to take this opportunity to thank multiple organisations and individuals for their efforts during and after that weather event and those floods. I know that my fellow representatives would be equally grateful to all of these groups. Let me start with community centres, locally based charities and emergency relief organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">West End Community House (Community Plus) was a great place for people to get hot meals. Food was being exchanged there and we had services being provided there. Micah Projects is a terrific organisation. They supported a lot of people, including by setting up a temporary place of warmth and shelter where people could get food. They did that in cooperation with the Australian Hellenic Progress Association, the Greek community association, which has quite a famous hall. The Bee Gees once played there. The hall was used for emergency relief during the floods in West End. Orange Sky laundry were of help in the floods. Red Cross, the Salvos, Meals on Wheels and Foodbank, who are based in my electorate, did so much work during the floods. The same is true of FareShare, a big commercial kitchen which turns Foodbank food and other donated food into ready-made meals. A rapid response team turned out to support workers who were helping others with the floods and to support the community. Backbone, the arts organisation, the East Brisbane Bowls Club and the 'Save our Bowlo' campaign set up a temporary relief place at East Brisbane, which was also affected by floods, to assist people who needed a hot meal. There is a photo on my Instagram of Sally, who was serving meals on their first night there—and I've got to tell you the food smelled absolutely delicious. At the YMCA Cannon Hill Community Centre, at the former Cannon Hill bowlo, Wendy and Alison and the volunteers were helping with food exchange but also with things like collecting toiletries. They ran a toiletries donation service for people affected by the floods, which was really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also multiple residents groups. The Bulimba Community Centre, for example, helped out in the Bulimba community. Kurilpa Futures, on the Kurilpa Peninsula, did a lot of the initial volunteer coordination to make sure that people who needed help were connected with people who wanted to give it. The West End Community Association provided a sort of information exchange and clearinghouse for services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the workers in multiple government agencies in all spheres of government that provided support. That includes Services Australia—and another big shout-out to our local liaison, Frank, at Services Australia and Centrelink, and also to the executive, Michelle, who I spoke to on a number of occasions during the floods—Miyun, from the NRRA; and Andrew, the CEO of the Bureau of Meteorology, and all of his team, who were incredibly responsive and so helpful in getting ahead of us with all the information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are all federal agencies, but there were plenty of other agencies as well. A big shout-out to Rhys, from Energex, who installed a new transformer down at Hill End. I was doorknocking—I was basically doing welfare checks during the floods—and residents were telling me that one of the problems with the electricity down at West End and Hill End was a transformer that was below the flood line. I harassed the state government about this and, next minute, Mick de Brenni, the minister, turned out the Energex guys to move that transformer. It was absolutely terrific to see them being so responsive. So I thank everyone from Energex. I thank everyone from Maritime Safety Queensland, who worked incredibly hard to look after the entire Brisbane River—and a shout-out to my good friend Matt, who works in MSQ. He was involved in getting that crane to safety—all Brisbane people know about that crane. I thank everyone at the Morningside sandbag depot. The team got up at three o'clock to come in from Ipswich, where they were also facing flooding, and other areas. They were lifting sandbags and helping the locals to look after the properties in the flood event. That was quite a big effort from them; it was just incredible. We had a great chat to Jerry in between forklift loads and sandbags. He said, 'Could you also just cook the barbecue?' We were very happy to do that. Unfortunately, we couldn't get the barbecue to work, first off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to add my thanks to the team at Buranda 'Guzies', Guzman y Gomez. I rolled in and said, 'Hey, could we have 20 different hot breakfasts, all with guacamole?' They dropped everything and got them out the door for us—at 6.30 am—to look after those depot workers. Thank you so much to everyone who travelled to Morningside to help the entire south of Brisbane with sandbags that day. It was incredible work from them and the people at 'Guzies'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you also to the ferry staff, the public transport staff, all the Brisbane City Council clean-up crew and the people managing waste. There was a lot of waste out of these floods because of the inundation of so many properties, particularly around West End but also through Hawthorne and other areas. I can only imagine what waste crews were dealing with. I thank Urban Utilities staff, who we had to call on when there were a range of problems with the Urban Utilities infrastructure in West End, where the basements of the big apartment buildings had been flooded. I thank the department of communities staff, departmental staff from various other departments' ministerial office staff, transport and traffic people, SEQ Water—all of these different agencies who are working to keep people safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a big shout-out to my own staff—who did everything from hauling sandbags to cooking barbecues to cleaning up community organisations to washing dishes—as well for all the help they provided. And, of course, I thank the Australian Defence Force, who were working so hard to help the clean-up. I want to say thank you to all the local businesses who supported. They made donations, food and provided phone charging. Avid Reader even had washing machines and dryers at their bookshop. It was quite incredible. But there are too many businesses to name. They were all so supportive. Insurance industry workers and the Insurance Council of Australia: thank you for your engagement with the locals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to our wonderful local churches and other religious groups, some from further afield as well—you know who you are—who provided hot meals, a place to shelter, a place to charge the phone and, in some cases, financial support to people who are doing it tough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to our locally based media organisations, who were a crucial instrument during these floods to keep people safe: ABC Brisbane, 4AAA 98.9 Indigenous radio, and Jan Bowman from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Westender</span> who was keeping everyone informed through the flood event. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to a couple of unions: the United Firefighters Union, who let us perch a barbecue on Montague Road so that we could give people some hot meals who hadn't had a hot meal in a couple of days, including some people who had been in really serious distress; and the Electrical Trades Union, for their campaign Operation Energise to get electricians to help flood-affected people all through the inner south-east. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to the Bulimba RSL as well. They cooked a barbecue for people who'd been campaigning on the big volunteer questions down at Bulimba, Hawthorne and Balmoral. They brought together everyone from businesses to community groups to just locals helping out, fed them all a snag and had a yarn with them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to all of our SES volunteers, who have been absolutely sterling. We all saw the grief that our community felt when an SES volunteer from further afield, from Lowood, died. I'm sure Mr Neumann, the member for Blair, who is here today, will mention it. Our hearts really went out to her family. I think every SES volunteer and everyone who drew on their help was reminded once more how valuable SES volunteers are to our community and how grateful we need to be for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thanks to all of the current and former MPs and counsellors who helped out in the area. I want to say thanks to community members—everyone; mums, dads, kids—who went and helped out at places like Eastern Suburbs Tigers that went under, like the Brisbane Jazz Club at Kangaroo Point, like the netball courts at the Metropolitan Districts Netball Association in Coorparoo, all of the many different organisations that required clean-up. People went and did everything they could to help them out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a big shout-out to Labor Party volunteers as well who were helping us to make sure that we were cooking a barbecue, knocking on doors to do welfare checks, holding stalls to provide information about federal support that was available and other forms of support that were available, and even turning up with their camp batteries so people could charge their phones. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our local councillors, Kara Cook, now has a campaign going on back-flow devices. I encourage everyone who's concerned about back-flow devices to have a look at her social media. I'm also running a survey of my own to get feedback about what needs to be done better in future disasters, and I welcome everyone's feedback. A lot of people are now seeing, really up close and personal, the impacts of climate change and they want to see real action on climate change. I'm hearing from people on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also hearing from people about how to respond to disasters and what they would like to see in the future: things like making sure there's no differential between different states when it comes to disaster payments and making sure we have Centrelink personnel in the field without having to have an argument about it, so just basic responses. I want to give a big shout-out to the Northern Rivers, who my community is also deeply concerned about. </span>

                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  To echo the words of the member for Griffiths in relation to the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, equally, whilst my community have suffered through the floods like hers has—and we were both on a call where we had a discussion with Services Australia about some of their lack of proactivity—we're equally concerned about the impact of the floods on northern New South Wales and we've had a number of great local community organisations provide support and services down there to assist. But I want to focus my statement today on my electorate of Forde and, more broadly, the city of Logan and also some of the northern parts of the Gold Coast, which in the context of what happened in Brisbane—and I have no doubt in the member for Blair's electorate as well, through Ipswich and Goodna—probably got somewhat overlooked in the scheme of things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the city of Logan there were some 282 houses that we know of that were fully inundated. That's a much smaller number than the number in Blair or in Griffiths, but there were also a large number of properties impacted in some shape or form by this flood event. It's interesting to learn, having been out and spoken to a number of those property owners, particularly where they live on local creeks, like the community at Bayes Road, Logan Reserve, who are on Schmidts creek, that they got flooded twice. They got flooded first from Schmidts creek by the flash flooding from the heavy rain through Sunday and Sunday night. Later they got flooded again by the Logan River as the flood came down the Logan River. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The two main rivers through my electorate are the Logan and Albert rivers, and this time both had slightly different flood peaks from 2017. Fortunately, the Albert River's peak was a little bit lower than in 2017. There were still a number of homes along Halls Road, Luscombe, a home on Beaudesert-Beenleigh Road at Wolfdene and a couple of houses on Old Mill Road at Bannockburn that got impacted. But there were fewer properties that were impacted than in 2017. Fortunately, the water stayed out of the famous Yatala Pies, but unfortunately, the Beenleigh Yatala Motor Inn once again got flooded. They were quickly back on their feet because they've been particularly busy. A number of properties on Albert Street at Eagleby again got flooded by the Albert River, but, again, to a lesser extent than last time. I'll address the issues regarding flooding of properties a little later. On the Logan River, it was certainly a different story. The flood peak on the Logan River was some 65 centimetres above that of 2017, and a lot of houses that escaped the flooding in 2017 got impacted this time. Unfortunately, those that were impacted last time obviously suffered more badly than they did in 2017. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look across the electorate and the city of Logan, I have to speak about, as have others have, the tremendous work that has been done by our community. I was reflecting on this with a number of constituents while I was out and about helping clean up after the floods. What was great to see, after two years of lockdowns and people being largely isolated because of COVID, was that our community once again in a time of crisis got out of their homes and got involved to help those in our community in most need. I commend the team at Logan House Fire Support Network, led by Louie Naumovski, who did an enormous amount of work coordinating volunteers to clean up. A lot of information was provided to him through Logan City Council, and he would coordinate volunteers to go out and check properties, see what help they needed, arrange teams to go out and clean those properties, remove rubbish, all of those sorts of things. The work was done by Louie and his crew in conjunction with assistance from Volunteering Queensland, Logan City Council and a number of community organisations that I wish to mention today, because I think their work and their efforts in supporting our community deserve to be recognised. St John Ambulance Queensland allowed Shayne Western to spend two weeks with Louie, helping him to assist and coordinate the recovery effort. They were based, for the first little period, at the office of the state member for Waterford, Shannon Fentiman. Later they based themselves out of Logan River Tree Farm, which was very badly inundated. We had, on a couple of days, a very large team of people there—on one day 250 people—helping clean up the tree farm and recover as much as they possibly could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other organisations that have been of tremendous support across our community to help this recovery effort include the IGA supermarkets at Loganholme and Loganlea; Nightlight; and Total Tools at Beenleigh, who are only a relatively new business. Louie rang me up one day and said: 'Bert, I need some high-pressure petrol-powered water cleaners.' I rang Total Tools and I spoke to Matt, and the team there jumped into action to provide the equipment we needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other organisations include Kennards Hire at Beenleigh; Bakers Delight at the Logan Hyperdome; Earth Markets at the Logan Hyperdome, who were tremendous in providing food for the volunteers at the base headquarters at Logan River Tree Farm; Lighthouse Care, who provided us with emergency food kits to take to people and help them get through; Ray White at Daisy Hill; RE/MAX Revolution at Shailer Park; and Diggermate Mini Excavator Hire. There were a couple of days when we needed, at short notice, a bobcat or a mini excavator. We rang Diggermate, and they said: 'Yep, we've got one here. Can you come and pick it up? As long as you've got somebody with a ticket, come and pick it up and do what you need with it. If you need for a couple of days, fantastic.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other organisations include Spring Transport; Gotzinger Smallgoods; Southside Milk; Sunny Queen eggs; and Rural Fire Brigade units. I saw units from all over the Northern Gold Coast and all over Logan at various properties as I went around—helping people clean up, remove rubbish, hose their houses out. There were also the SES of Logan; the ADF; and the Logan and Gold Coast city councils. Beenleigh PCYC was a community recovery centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these organisations, whilst not solving the problem of people's houses being flooded, made the difficult situation people were in that little bit easier because they knew they had that help and support to try and start the journey of rebuilding their lives. Sadly, many of these people will not be back in their homes for 12 or 18 months. Some who have two-storey houses are fortunate enough that they can live upstairs, but they will not be able to use downstairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my remaining time, I want to talk about one of the reflections out of this. I look at the flood event of 2017 and the flood event now of 2022. I lived in the area in my younger days and remember the impact of the floods in 1974, when there wasn't the population we have today. I look at the development that has occurred. We could have had a 1974 event, when we had flood levels nearly two metres higher than what we've had on the Logan River recently. One of the discussions I've started to have with Logan City Council and a number of the insurance companies is: how do we build back better and do it differently? That includes resumptions of some properties. Interestingly, some of the property owners I've spoken to are very open to the idea of their properties being resumed, at fair market value—what it was before the flood, not what it is now—so they can move on with their lives, and we can turn those areas into bushland or parkland for community benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, a number of people I have spoken to have said to me: 'Last time it cost the insurance company $250,000 or $300,000 to repair my home. Now it's going to cost more. We know building costs and everything have gone up.' They said, 'We can move the house from here, six metres up the block, and put it on stilts and just have an open carport underneath and it will be flood free.' They're the discussions we need to have. I think the insurance company should be open to those discussions because in the long term it is going to save their money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of those institutions and all of the individuals involved. Thank you for the effort to help our community recover. We will continue to support you going forward.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  On Friday evening, 25 February, I attended a Raemus Rover racing season launch at Yamanto. That evening I was at a workshop and the pounding, relentless rain made it difficult to hear anything. I kept on getting phone calls from the mayor of Ipswich and the mayor of Somerset. I constantly went back and forth to the meeting. The flood was upon us. The president of the RSL Raemus Rover racing organisation, Ian Baker, and his wife, Justine, were becoming concerned that they wouldn't be able to get back to Karalee. Their homes is on the Brisbane River, with creeks intersecting their street at either end. Karalee is akin to an island, surrounded by the Brisbane River on two sides and the Bremer River on the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Blair has the Wivenhoe Dam, the Somerset Dam, the Brisbane River, the Bremer River, the Lockyer Creek, the Bundamba Creek and so many others. It's flood central. I drove home that evening through the back blocks of Yamanto, taking a circuitous route to avoid the flooded roads. In my 14-plus years as a federal MP, we have experienced three significant floods. I lived through the 1974 flood in my parents' house. It was eight feet over the roof. My family were evacuated. We saw military vehicles going down the street, providing support, relief and even vaccinations later on, which might be news to the minister for emergency management, who claimed the ADF hadn't been involved in such a domestic disaster even 20 years ago, let alone 50 years ago. In 2011 and 2013, it flooded again in our area. This is the fourth major flood in my lifetime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 February, disaster struck Coolana, a small community in the Somerset region of Blair. Merryl Dray, a 62-year-old SES volunteer, along with three other SES personnel, responded to a call from a local family. The family needed evacuation as floodwaters rose around them. On the way, the SES vehicle was swept off the road. The four occupants were able to climb out, but tragically Merryl was swept away. She was beloved by the Lowood SES group and by her family and her friends. She was well trained, with more than 520 hours of experience over 4½ years of service. This was a sad reminder of the dangers our emergency services personnel face every time they head out. My condolences go to Merryl's family—her immediate family, her extended family and her SES family—and all the SES volunteers around South-East Queensland, so many of whom knew her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank our SES volunteers, our emergency services personnel, frontline workers, the police, the ADF, the rural fire brigades, the RSLs, the faith based organisations who helped out, the chambers of commerce and the small businesses who helped out—those clubs, unions and so many others who helped out to help people recover and to protect and serve the communities they love. It has been a difficult few years for frontline workers, with two years of uncertainty and disturbance as a result of COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got another rain bomb, as the Queensland Premier said. It hit South-East Queensland. In three days, we got over 80 percent of our annual rainfall. Intense rainfall broke riverbanks and claimed 13 lives in South-East Queensland. Homes, livelihoods and farms were destroyed. In my electorate, areas were cut off. Karana Downs and Mount Crosby are the only two Brisbane suburbs in my electorate. It is normal for the low-lying Colleges Crossing to flood, but the water normally recedes pretty quickly. They were cut off. They call themselves 'Crosby Island' and the rest of Australia 'the mainland'. They were cut off. All the ways for them to get out, all the bridges, were cut off everywhere. So for three days they were without food being delivered and they were cut off from any sort of medical treatment. I will come to that in a minute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate Colleges Crossing medical practice and doctors Cath Hester and Tony Bayliss, who arranged emergency medical supply drops and kept the community and so many others informed. Vicky Mills of Karana Downs set up a food distribution centre. Like so many others, such as Councillor Cheryl Gaedtke in Somerset, Arthur Needham helped me in terms of information every day. I was cut off in Ipswich central and couldn't get out to many of these places. All these country towns in my electorate in the Somerset region were cut off. Arthur Needham kept me—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr NEUMANN:</span>
                  </a>  I want to thank the councillors and the council staff of the Ipswich City Council and the Somerset Regional Council. I want to thank, also, Mayor Graeme Lehmann and CEO Andrew Johnson of the Somerset Regional Council for keeping me apprised of what's going on in detail. I also thank Councillor Kate Kunzelmann for her regular updates from the Ipswich City Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Somerset council gets cut off, and I want to praise the Somerset council for learning from mistakes made back in 2011. The Somerset council did a fantastic job, in my view, of building back better—building bridges and making roads better. So I want to thank them very much, because that's what you should be doing: building back better. They made sure that their infrastructure was better when they replaced and improved it after the 2011 flood. It was obvious in 2013 and even more obvious this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to say thank you to some of the councillors up there in the Somerset council—who lead their communities, by the way—for making sure that people were cared for. I thank the RSLs up there and the Toogoolawah Show Society, who looked after people. The RSL in Kilcoy did a fantastic job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were problems. There was a situation where about 60 people were trapped by floods, east of the D'Aguilar Highway, east of Kilcoy, east of Kilcoy Creek, and there were issues in relation to that. These are lessons to be learned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank longstanding principal Di Pedersen of the Mount Tarampa State School, who looked after about 12 other people there for three days during that time. After about three days, Di thought: 'We're running out of food from the tuckshop. We'd better call for help.' And she did a mighty job, by the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ipswich had stranded residents in Karalee, and I know there are people in Karalee who feel they were forgotten. There are things that could have been done better, and there are many grievances people have about what went on. There was a slow response at times in terms of communication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Lyn Birnie and Marie Kavanagh for their great work in getting the school hall at Karalee open to the public as a place of refuge. I want to give great praise to Dave Cullen for keeping people informed, on radio. River 949 radio and West Bremer Radio did a fantastic job in keeping people informed. We had lots of hard-hit suburbs—hundreds of houses in places like Bundamba, North Booval, East Ipswich, Brassall, North Ipswich, Moores Pocket, Basin Pocket and so many other places. I visited many areas, and I walked the streets providing advice, support and care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my staff, too, who did a great job during the floods helping people living with the trauma they are going through. I'm still amazed by the people I met who were cleaning out their homes and dumping treasured items, photo albums and furniture, people like Francis Togia, at Diane Court in North Booval, or Lorraine Dunn and Kevin Enright, at Christine Court, also in North Booval. While Francis was busy preparing to rebuild his kids' bedroom under his house, Lorraine and Kevin, aged in their 70s and 80s, were not coming back, and that's what has happened for a lot of people—they're not coming back. For businesspeople in the heart of Ipswich, we've got issues in Marsden Parade, Limestone Street and Brisbane Street. We've got people like Noel and Janet Roberts, who have relocated their Ace Computer World over to Yamanto from Ipswich. We have issues there, and the council needs to have a look at that. There are flood issues, and it took a long time for people to get help. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank some local heroes, and there are so many of them: Bruce Robertson, for the great work he did at Brassall State School as principal, leading that community that was inundated, with one building almost destroyed, rebuilding to do and sewage in the playgrounds. I met 25-year-old Jordan Smith, who was doorknocking flood affected people in North Ipswich. I'd heard all about him. He was helping flood affected people, delivering sandwiches and water, helping people move heavy items and checking on their welfare. He'd been flooded when he was living in Rockhampton. He wanted to do his bit. Troy Dixon in North Booval did the same, driving around, providing food and drinks, supplying drinks on his front lawn, providing his laundry facilities for flood affected neighbours and offering a place to sleep for those who couldn't sleep in their homes. Troy and his neighbour Anna spent their entire pay cheques on food and drinks, while the public started dropping off items for them to help their neighbours. Troy was amazed that, even when people had lost everything, they kept on smiling. These are great heroes. They are fantastic people. There are so many I could name, but they're just a few. There are a lot of things we can learn. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Services Australia staff, but the flood eligibility when it comes to 'adversely affected' is too restrictive. The amounts need to be increased. The delivery of services needs to be quicker. The ADF need to be applied more quickly in my community. The Ipswich City Council needs to do better in terms of road closure signs, and why we only had one flood evacuation centre in Ipswich, at the showgrounds, is beyond me when you could have multiple centres in the Somerset region. We had multiple centres in the 2011 floods. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of things we can do better, but at every level of government this is the time to rebuild and support people. There is a time and place for review, and for hard questions of all of us, at every level of government, as to how we can improve situations, including voluntary buybacks in places. I thank the community who backed it, the clubs like the Karalee Tornadoes Rugby League Club, the Norths Tigers Rugby League Club and the Ipswich Knights Soccer Club. All of them, and so many others, were affected. We're with you, and we're going to back you and help you to recover.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  It is shocking that just a couple of weeks ago we were devastated by the scenes from northern New South Wales, and today again we're seeing the footage of what's happened to Lismore. After those poor people have probably just started to get on top of the devastation of the last lot of floods, to be facing the same devastation again really is beyond words. It is beyond words to think about how difficult things must be in northern New South Wales at the moment. I want to send a particular message to those who have been evacuated and those who are struggling in Lismore, Byron Bay, Ballina and all of the towns surrounding those centres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, northern New South Wales is not the only part of Australia that's suffered devastating flooding in recent weeks, and I think all of us who are speaking in this debate would join in sending our heartfelt best wishes and support to every community that's been affected in Queensland and in New South Wales—in northern New South Wales, in Western Sydney and in other parts of Sydney. Even in my own electorate, in the centre of the biggest city in the country, we had some spot flooding, and we had families and businesses affected by that. So this is an incredibly widespread series of events. My heartfelt plea to all of those who continue to be affected is to stay safe, follow the advice of police and emergency services to stay out of floodwaters in particular, and look after each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in South-East Queensland with the member for Blair and the member for Moreton immediately after the worst flooding in their electorates. I have to say that it was confronting to walk through streets covered in mud, to walk onto the front lawns of homes covered in mud, and to walk into homes and see the watermark way above my head. In fact, in the homes that we were visiting, the water had completely filled the downstairs area and we were looking at watermarks upstairs. So these homes had been flooded above ceiling height. These families had just cleaned up from the last flood a few years ago and were just getting back on their feet, only to suffer this devastation again. It is incredible what human beings can endure in circumstances such as these.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I truly wish that more of the $4.8 billion fund that the government had set aside for disasters had been used. The Emergency Response Fund has now been in place for three disaster seasons and has gained $800 million in interest at a time when that money should have been used to build culverts, levees and emergency evacuation centres. It's clear what a lot of these communities need, and they're quite happy to tell you what they need: they need to stay safe and have a place to go when things get really bad. That this fund exists is beyond understanding. Apparently, it's like a term deposit: 'We're not going to touch it until we grow up.' I don't know what the problem is and why the rollout of this fund has been so slow, but it is completely unacceptable. Labor have said that, if we were in government, we would spend at least $200 million a year of a reconstituted fund on those projects, which would help keep communities safer, as opposed to the impacts we 've seen through these most recent disasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local members, both government and opposition, have been working phenomenally hard in their communities to try and help them recover. I had the Human Services portfolio in 2011. I was ringing local members in Queensland, both LNP members and Labor members, and asking, 'Do you have the help you need?' Local members are phenomenally connected to their communities and arguing for what their communities need for recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm not sure if anybody's had quite the experience that my state colleague Janelle Saffin had. Her home has been completely destroyed and she had to swim for her life to get out of her flooded property. All members of parliament are working well in their communities, but Janelle, it seems, is lucky not to have lost her life. She is in the Lismore area. Having been in Lismore after past floods, I know the toll it takes on local communities who, let's face it, struggle at the best of times. People who are running small businesses in country towns like Lismore aren't living a life of luxury; they're working very hard every day. I know that these most recent two flood events, back-to-back, will really take their toll. I'm grateful to all of the people who are working hard in communities that have been flood affected. People in an official capacity are there— our emergency services personnel; our Defence personnel; and the public servants who are going up from the Department of Human Services and others agencies to help people get the payments that they need just to buy nappies, buy medicine, get their prescriptions filled. I am grateful to all of them for doing that work of helping people. There is also the example of volunteering that we see after natural disasters. Every single time, you see Australians turning up without question, with no thought for themselves, not stinting in their labour to help their neighbours. I saw this with the member for Blair and the member for Moreton when I was visiting their electorates. I ran into people I knew there. They were a long way from home and were covered in mud, literally hosing out people's homes—washing the mud out of lounge rooms. Thank you again to all of those volunteers as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by saying this. On that trip to Brisbane, one of the places that my colleague the member for Blair took me to was Ipswich State High School. It's a fantastic, brilliant high school that is brilliantly led. Their oval had been completely covered by the floods. Their school hall was in a pretty poor condition, and was even before the floods. I was really happy to announce, with the member for Blair, a $2 million investment in a new community sports hub for that school. These kinds of practical investments are really the things we will need to do to help communities rebuild, to help them reconnect with one another and to help them recover from what has been a really devastating incident, coming on the back of these natural disasters that seem to become more frequent and worse with the passage of time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  Every Anzac Day I do a publication, and this year's publication is a little bit different than most. This is the12th publication I have produced for Anzac Day, but this publication has always been, as the word suggests on the cover, commemorative. It is a booklet written to generally mark past service and sacrifice while acknowledging the men and women across our country and in missions around the world who are presently wearing an Australian Defence Force uniform and doing us all proud. But this year's booklet also acknowledges what's going on in Ukraine as we speak. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The price of peace is eternal vigilance. It is also—as I acknowledged at the 3 March Ukraine war Wagga Wagga prayer vigil in the Victory Memorial Gardens—eternal compassion. The price of peace is also eternal compassion. Australia is not a warmongering nation. We have played our part in the past to protect and save other peace-abiding nations. To protect ourselves, we will always do what is required and what is asked with our allies to uphold international law and freedom. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, President Vladimir Putin has directed his Russian army against Ukraine. The 24 February invasion and what has followed has led to so many deaths of soldiers on both sides as well as innocent Ukrainian citizens. Wagga Wagga will play an integral part in any military response taken by our nation, given its unique status as a tri-service training centre. We have all three arms of Defence in Wagga Wagga, and they always stand ready to do what is required. We are assisting Ukraine very much, with $91 million in military assistance, more than 500 sanctions to impose costs on Russia, $65 million in humanitarian aid, more than 5,000 visas issued to Ukrainians and more underway—more than 1,100 Ukrainians have already arrived in Australia—and donating 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to help keep the lights on, homes heated and factories running in Ukraine. But there's more that we can, more that we must and more that we will do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, the 3 March community prayer vigil attracted, with very little notice, 200 Wagga Wagga citizens. As I spoke and looked out across the crowd holding the Ukrainian flag, I noticed there were people with tears in their eyes. The night was highlighted by Ukrainians citizen Larissa Burak, who's made Wagga Wagga her home, performing her country's national anthem on an instrument called the bandura. It was stirring, perhaps even haunting, to hear that instrument played so well and to hear her beautiful voice singing her national anthem so proudly and with such conviction. People of all faiths attended the vigil, including Dr Ata u-Rehman of the Muslim Association of Riverina Wagga Wagga. Previous vigils have been held in our city, for the Christchurch terror attacks of 2019 and for the bombings of Sri Lanka in the same year. Wagga Wagga always comes together. We're a very multicultural city. More than 100 nations are represented on Australia Day in our fair city. I want to acknowledge one person in particular, Joan Saboisky of the San Isidore Refugee Committee. She helped arrange this prayer vigil and of course she is urging the government to do what it can for refugees. She's also doing everything she can, as a private citizen and as a member of this organisation, to embrace and put out the welcoming mat for these refugees. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I read only the other day that 4½ million people have been displaced—4½ million people. That is an extraordinary number. I was so moved by the situation in Ukraine, but I was also very moved by the response from Wagga Wagga people. Since 2014 more than 2,000 Yazidis have resettled in New South Wales, of whom more than 800 have made their home in Wagga Wagga. They're now very much part and parcel of our city. Indeed, I even have a Yazidi refugee, who couldn't speak English four years ago, working in my electoral office in Wagga Wagga. Dawlat is an amazing person who always greets constituents with a warm smile and answers the phone beautifully. This is what can be done and this is what should be done when we have refugees fleeing persecution, fleeing violence and fleeing war-torn situations. I'm sure that Wagga Wagga—indeed, communities in the Riverina electorate, from Parkes to West Wyalong and from Yerong Creek to Cowra—would welcome with compassion, as they have done in the past, any refugees from Ukraine who come to our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. This is a humanitarian crisis, and Australia will stand ready to do what we can, as we always do. But Moscow needs to act and act now to pull out its troops to stop this bloody invasion that has caused such heartache and terror among Ukraine's citizens. What an amazing response from the leader of Ukraine. He's a former comedian whose solidarity with his people is truly remarkable, I have to say. If he's not <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span>'s Person of the Year then I'll be very, very surprised. We've heard about a number of atrocities that have been reported involving innocent civilians—and, of course, they're all innocent—including the bombing of a school in Mariupol, where a reported 400 civilians were sheltering, and an air strike on a theatre in the same centre. But the bombing of maternity hospitals is just despicable. It breaks the hearts of all fair-minded people to see these sorts of actions being taken. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I say to the people of Ukraine: Australia stands with you, as does every fair-minded nation on this planet. We are with you, we support you, we feel your pain and we will not abandon you. After the war is over—and I've no doubt that Ukraine will prevail over its invaders—there'll be a massive rebuilding task which will require the help of all the nations on earth. It will require generosity from nations such as Australia, and we will provide that generosity. I'm sure, whatever government takes the treasury bench after the May election, that support will be there, because I know how horrified all members of this parliament are about what is happening in Ukraine at the moment. We wish our friends in Kyiv and elsewhere in that war-torn nation all the very best as they combat evil, as they combat tyranny, as they combat this invasion that should never, ever have occurred. We stand with them, we pray with them and we love them. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  Yes, we do stand with the people of Ukraine in the condemnation of Russia's war of aggression. This is an illegal war based on a discredited idea of Russian imperialism in Eastern Europe. Ukraine is its own country with its own history. It has sovereignty. It has the right to territorial independence. It has the right to make its own decisions within its own borders. It has the right to live in peace. This war is an irrational act of brutality. It's bad for the people of Ukraine and it's also bad for ordinary Russians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ukraine, led by President Zelenskyy, has shown remarkable bravery in front of the advance of the Russian military. It's incredible, when you look at the ordinary Ukrainians who have taken up arms—teenagers, teachers, bus drivers—people like you and me, saying, 'We will not surrender.' Fighting for your own country is such a powerful motivation, and invaders almost always underestimate the willpower of people fighting for their own country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Slovenia in 1991 when Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from the former Yugoslavia, which started the process of what was called the 'Ten-Day War'. In Slovenia, a military was stood up almost overnight. You had ordinary people driving their family car onto the highway to try and block the path of the tanks. You had middle-aged people, who hadn't picked up a gun since their military service as an 18-year-old, picking up a gun and going out, prepared to fight and prepared to die. I see that same spirit in the Ukrainian population. People are saying, 'I would rather not live if I have to live under Russian occupation.' It is just phenomenally courageous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been inspirational, but it's an inspiration that has come with so much tragedy and, honestly, so much waste attached to it, so much loss of human life. It's not just the thousands who have lost their lives. It's the four million refugees, with another 50,000 leaving every day. It's the buildings, the cities, that will have to be rebuilt. It's the poverty and the lack of food as transport lines are broken. It's all of the suffering that the people of Ukraine will endure for years to come—even if peace were declared tomorrow—because of this mad decision by Vladimir Putin. The cost of it is so extraordinary. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen so many alarming, disturbing reports of protesting civilians being shot at, of schools and hospitals being bombed, despite having declared that there were only civilians inside. We've seen families who've fled, carrying their few possessions on their shoulders, away from the face of the war. There are millions affected, and the impacts will last for years for the people of Ukraine. But this also really challenges the system that has, by and large, kept the world relatively safe and relatively conflict free since the Second World War. The principle that countries don't invade their neighbours, that all of us obey the international rules based system, has, by and large, meant that we have lived through a relatively peaceful few decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to try and predict the future. If Vladimir Putin gets away with this, who knows what his next target will be? Also, what message would that send to other totalitarian regimes and other large countries that have territorial disputes with their neighbours? That's why it is absolutely critical for Australia to stand with the United States, stand with Europe, stand with NATO and, most particularly of course, stand with the people of Ukraine to say: 'This shall not pass. This shall not happen. We won't let it happen.' As the Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is an important point. We work for peace, but we don't take it for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has traditionally played a role in the international community as a country that is dedicated, at times of conflict, to helping parties come to a resolution. We played an extraordinary role in Cambodia to do that. We played an extraordinary role in supporting the East Timorese independence vote. There are so many examples where Australia has had a role that, perhaps due to the size of our population, you wouldn't necessarily expect. It is important that we not just do whatever we can to help the people of Ukraine in the immediate need that they have but also reiterate and do whatever we can to support an international rules based system. That is the only way countries have of peacefully resolving differences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the responsibility of Vladimir Putin—no-one else—to stop this aggression now. We, Australia, along with other nations, are putting pressure on Vladimir Putin and the people around him with sanctions, including the targeted sanctions that are directly, we hope, impacting on people who might have some influence on President Putin. But I have to say that it is also important that other large nations, including permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, such as China, do whatever they can to put pressure on the Russians to stop this madness. That's why so many of us were alarmed by the no-limits friendship arrangement that has been recently entered into by Russia and China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by just focusing for a moment on the people of Russia. It is obviously 100 per cent the responsibility of Russia to stop this aggression, to withdraw its troops and to accept that this was wrong from the very beginning. I am so impressed by the people of Ukraine and how bravely they have fought this invasion, but I am also impressed by the bravery of those Russians who've stood up to an authoritarian president. We know that there are Russians being arrested in their thousands for saying exactly what I am saying here today—that this war is wrong and that it should be opposed. You can go to jail, and not for a short time, for saying that, in Vladimir Putin's Russia. So all of my thoughts and all of my support are going out of the people of Ukraine today, and also to those brave Russians who are calling out this madness and demanding it stop.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  As the member for Sydney quite rightly pointed out, it is madness. In just four weeks, we've seen the war in Ukraine cause the largest refugee movement since the Second World War. Bombs are dropping day and night. There are horrific scenes of hospitals bombed, including a maternity hospital bombed. There have been miraculous recoveries, as well, of people who have escaped from those attacks. But there have been children who have been orphaned as well as deaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the many stories and pictures, I've plucked out one to share. That was of Alena and her seven-year-old son, Nikodin. There's a picture, and some of you might have seen it, of Nikodin, who's seven, clutching his prized possession—a deflated football—while he was hiding for safety with his mum. There are still a thousand people trapped under the ruins of a theatre in Mariupol. There are countless stories of sadness and suffering everywhere across Ukraine, and of course there's no greater sense of urgency than over the humanitarian catastrophe that's occurring in many cities, but particularly in Mariupol, given the siege that they have been under. There are also stories of bravery and courage, and stories of the Ukrainian people risking their lives to stand up and fight the Russian aggression, refusing to capitulate to Vladimir Putin and the demands of a dictator. Millions of Ukrainians have stayed to fight, or returned to fight, for their country and for their democracy. As we've heard, Putin's invasion of Ukraine is not just an attack on Ukrainian sovereignty. Actually, it is an attack on one of the core principles of the post-World War II era, that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State…</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all members of a parliament and, I would say, of a great democracy. Australia is one of the oldest continuous democracies in the world, and, in many respects, we have a collective duty to stand up for human rights, for international law and for that liberal rules-based order, and to speak up when those rights are diminished or abused, whether that be here or abroad. That's the least we can do as elected representatives of this great democracy. That is fundamentally why all of us here, as well as our leader, Anthony Albanese, and the shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, have repeatedly called for Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and condemned Russia's aggression, which violates international law, undermines security in the region and the world, and lacks basic decency. The barbarity of it is there for the whole world to see, despite their disinformation campaigns. We see the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a responsibility to work with our allies and support Ukraine in any way that we can. The opposition has provided that support to push back against authoritarian regimes trying to interfere in our systems and undermine that liberal rules-based order. This really goes beyond party lines; this is not about partisanship, because we are at an inflection point globally. There is a contest between authoritarian regimes and democracies that is happening around the globe. That is the struggle of our age, and one that we will be grappling with for at least the next couple of decades. We have supported, as an opposition, the commitments that the government has made to provide Ukraine with cybersecurity and military aid—lethal aid and non-lethal aid. We've supported the government's imposition of Magnitsky sanctions under our new laws that have targeted individuals in Russia and their family members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also have a lot of work to do in our own region. As some of the previous speakers have mentioned, the invasion of Ukraine has shone a light on the troubling strategic convergence between Beijing and Moscow. This is something that we are front and centre of, being one of the regional powers in the Indo-Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a recent trip to the United States with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which I attended with the chair, Senator Paterson, we agreed to leave partisanship and shenanigans back here in Canberra. We were working together in a bipartisan fashion and in a diplomatic effort to advance Australia's objectives on that trip. We saw that there was a very bright spot of bipartisanship, as well, in the US Congress, in the Senate and the House, when it came to support for Ukraine. We saw how much the US political system had galvanised around support for Ukrainians and how surprised they were by the resistance, bravery, courage and effectiveness of the fight that had been put up by Ukrainians. There was also a bright spot of bipartisanship that we noted when it came to the Indo-Pacific region as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also all surprised by how the EU and the European democracies have stood up in support of Ukraine. That is of real importance, because countries like Switzerland, who have been neutral for hundreds of years, have taken a stand. This is beyond partisanship. It's beyond political sides here. We're talking about Greens foreign ministers in Germany stepping up to the plate on defence spending. There is a cognisance, amongst our friends in Europe, of the importance of demonstrating unity and tangible, substantive support for Ukraine in their time of need. That has been something worth seeing, because it gives us some inspiration for the work that we have to do to get over the kind of silly partisan fights that we sometimes have and to see the bigger picture of what needs to be done to protect our way of life. There was, as I said, also a very important discussion around US engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and the importance of an economic framework that can provide an alternative for countries in the region to participate in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the three D's of statecraft: defence, diplomacy and development. This is what it's about. It's the hard work that a middle power like Australia has to do. That's why Labor's shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, often speaks about the need to put Australian values, such as respect for international human rights, at the centre of our foreign policy. This is not a naive approach. It actually makes a lot of sense. In the world that we live in today, this is more necessary than ever. The standing up for those values actually matters. The unity that we see between other like-minded countries and democracies actually matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter where we see human rights being abused and diminished around the world, it's our duty as political leaders—in the sense that we are elected members of this parliament—to stand up and speak out against it. It's critically important for us to champion human rights when it comes to Ukraine, when it comes to Myanmar, when it comes to the democracy protesters in Hong Kong, when it comes to so many spots around the world where that contest between authoritarianism and democracy is a frontline battle, where people are actually losing their lives fighting for the freedoms that some might say we take for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That fight for freedom and democracy around the world is one that we should show leadership in, and be part of, in solidarity. But we should also be on the frontline, at the very least, in what we say in this place. The president of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy, will be addressing this parliament tomorrow, and we need to listen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  Recently, I attended the Ukrainian church in my electorate. It's a small church in Woolloongabba. I attended alongside the state member for Greenslopes, Joe Kelly MP, and Queensland minister Leanne Linard. Senator Anthony Chisholm was with us. Also in attendance was Australia 's Governor-General, who had come to this small church in Woolloongabba in my electorate, as we all did, to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we listened to the service, as we stood with them, we wanted to express our strong support for the Ukrainian community of Australia, the diaspora here, but to all people from Ukraine who are facing a really terrible and unjust war being waged upon them. I think it's important to stand up against imperialism, to stand up against oppression. I want to pay tribute to every Ukrainian person who is standing in defiance, whether at home or abroad, against this unjust war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was quite remarkable to me. I had not been to a Ukrainian church service before. We were in this small church but it was really full. The service is sung, and there was this beautiful singing ringing out through the church, in defiance of what was happening in their homeland, and in support for one another. Probably the most remarkable part of this service was when Father Stefan gave the homily. The homily was about forgiveness. It was quite remarkable to be with those people and to hear those words. I want to pay tribute to him, Father Stefan, and Father Martin, who were there with the parishioners. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to the Ukrainian Community of Queensland Inc., which is the community group for Ukrainians in my home state. They organised a good attendance at that service and, subsequent to it, organised a really big, well-attended and impeccably conducted—while I was there, at least—rally in King George Square. It was attended by a number of my colleagues as well as representatives from the broader community but was led by the Ukrainian community. At that rally, that we all attended after the church service, we saw a sea of blue and yellow. We saw defiance. We saw resistance. We saw hope. These are a people who believe that they will prevail in this war, that this unjust war will come to an end and that their people will continue and that their nation will continue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an interesting day. It was during the Brisbane floods. It was 6 March, this rally, and the Brisbane floods, as you probably know, had been happening twice a day for several days in the lead-up to that day. People were still cleaning up. It was incredibly humid and there was mud everywhere. But it was really heartening to see that people took time out even of a disaster to come to King George Square, in the centre of Brisbane, and show that solidarity. A number of us did that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say congratulations to Peter Bongiorni, the president of the UCQ, and his mum, who very clearly played a big part in the organising of the rally, his partner, the immediate past president of the UCQ and all the members of the committee and the organisation, who'd clearly been working tirelessly in the face of a natural disaster—in the face of war at home—to organise this opportunity for the community to come together and to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, it's important for all of us in this parliament to express our support for Ukrainians, who are going through a terrifying and difficult time facing this unjust war, to acknowledge their capacity for defiance, to acknowledge their willingness to stand up. I mentioned the floods. I was thinking during the floods about the Ukrainians while I was out putting sandbags in trucks and making sure the community groups had the connections they needed to deliver services. My counterparts from the Ukrainian parliament, in Ukraine, had their Twitter feeds full of members of parliament having to learn how to use a gun and making the decision to stay in the capital to fight. It was quite humbling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the story isn't about members of parliament. It isn't even about President Zelenskyy, no matter how brave and no matter how much leadership he and his family have shown. The story is about individual Ukrainians, everyday people living everyday lives, who all of a sudden are being bombed and facing this campaign against them, who are nonetheless standing together and facing it down. I want to pay tribute to them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we've heard from other speakers that Labor stands in solidarity with Ukrainians, as does every member of this parliament, I expect, and as does the nation. I'm certainly very pleased to be part of an opposition, an alternative government, that is willing to render any assistance we can practically provide to the people of Ukraine as they face down this threat, this unjust war, this autocratic regime. I'm proud to be part of a democracy; I'm proud of our democracy. As a strong democracy it is incumbent upon us to stand up for democracy, it is incumbent upon us to stand up against unjust wars. I'm proud to be a small part of an international effort to stand up for these principles that we all believe in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I again say thank you to all members of the Queensland Ukrainian community and all members of the Australian Ukrainian community for the work they are doing to provide opportunities to stand in solidarity. To those who fight, to those who are at home in Ukraine, to those who are trying to care for children or elderly loved ones, to those who are trying to resist or to those who are just trying to survive: we see you and we stand in solidarity with you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I rise to speak about the war in Ukraine. I want to acknowledge the heartfelt speeches I've just heard from the member for Griffith, the member for Wills and the member for Sydney. It's been 34 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. We've been witnessing the devastating loss of life and attacks on civilians, including attacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities. The World Health Organization has confirmed that there have been more than 70 separate attacks on hospitals, ambulances and doctors in Ukraine, with the number increasing on a daily basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have been shocked and saddened to see this—and seeing a maternity hospital attacked was a particularly sickening example. We're seeing families being torn apart as men stay to fight for their country and women try to get the rest of the family to safety. We're seeing little children weeping as they say goodbye to their fathers, for reasons that they have no comprehension of, and adults knowing that they may never see them again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN estimates that close to 1,000 civilians have been killed, although this most likely underestimates the real figure, and it will continue to climb until peace can be restored. We have seen the senseless destruction of cities and infrastructure. We have seen more than 3.5 million Ukrainians fleeing their homes for safety in neighbouring nations, and the United Nations has predicted that the number of refugees from the conflict could reach four million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this invasion, Vladimir Putin has attacked the rules based order that has guaranteed peace and prosperity since the end of World War II. He has torn up those rules. This is an illegal and unjust war. Ukraine is fighting for sovereignty, democracy and freedom. Ukrainians have the right to live in peace. The courageous resistance of the Ukrainian people has been inspirational. The leadership of the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who will address our parliament tomorrow, has also been inspirational. I very much look forward to that address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine and to those in Australia who have lost or are worried about their loved ones who are caught up in that violence. I also want to acknowledge the Russians who are so bravely protesting against this dictatorship and this war. For us here in Australia it is hard to fathom what that really means—because we live in a democracy, where we have the right to protest and to speak against our government. That is something we must deeply value and continue to stand up for with pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the privilege to speak at a vigil here in Canberra, organised by Amnesty International, at the Nara Peace Park not far from this building. As the member for Canberra, and on behalf of our community and of our parliament, I reiterate to the Canberra Ukrainian community that we stand with you in solidarity and that our hearts are with you in this unthinkable pain that you are in. We had some incredible speakers at the vigil talking about their homeland, their experiences and their families and loved ones who are still there. One of those speakers was Aleksandr Demianenko, who works at the Australian National University. He and his wife and young daughter had just returned from being in Ukraine before this happened. He spoke very passionately about those he knows who have been tragically killed—a school friend was one—about the heartbreak felt by Ukrainians watching the destruction of their homeland and about his condemnation of Mr Putin's aggression. Canberrans really stand with Ukrainians in our condemnation of that, as does this parliament. I've been really pleased to see that Australia has granted more than 5,000 visas to Ukrainians in Ukraine, and hundreds more to Ukrainians elsewhere, and that more than 1,000 of these visa holders have already arrived safely in Australia and will continue to arrive every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vitally important that Australia plays this role in accepting refugees from Ukraine and from all conflicts around the world. Afghanistan is another example where we have seen so many people's livelihoods and futures destroyed. Many of them are seeking a future here in Australia and we should grant that to more people than we do at the moment. Just today, I heard from a constituent who has managed to get five members of her family here to Canberra. We will be seeking visas for them, and I hope that I will be able to help her with that. They are five female members of her family. The men are remaining there to fight for their country and its sovereignty. That is absolutely heartbreaking. Attacks on global peace and security impact us all, and it is not in anyone 's interest for any country to think that they can threaten sovereignty or change the status quo by force. It's important that we demonstrate that these actions come with a cost, and that's why Australia and the world have a responsibility to join in the defence of Ukraine and the principles of democracy and freedom. Australia has joined in exerting diplomatic pressure, imposing sanctions on Russia and supplying aid to Ukraine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has, of course, given bipartisan support to these efforts, and Australia should be working in concert with our international partners to continue to ratchet up these costs for Mr Putin and his regime. Labor is also supportive of additional assistance for Ukraine, including coal and humanitarian and military assistance. Strong and comprehensive measures are required to support Ukraine's pushback against Russia's invasion. Again, I just want to say to our Ukrainian community here in Canberra and around Australia, that Australians stand with you and our hearts are with you.</span>

                  <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  What many of us have learnt over the last few weeks is that there are many people in our communities who have always had a place in their hearts for Ukraine—people who've moved to Australia from Ukraine and people who've had long associations. What we've discovered in Australia over the last month is that Ukraine has grown a little place in all of our hearts. Unfortunately, that has happened because of the shameful invasion that Russia has initiated. The actions that we take in this place, and the actions the government must continue to take, must protect Ukraine's future. As many have already said, this attack is wholly unprovoked and has absolutely no justification. Again, we must be very clear that Russia is the aggressor and is responsible for the bloodshed and lives that have been taken in this violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand with the people of Ukraine and we stand with those that seek to defend their nation, a nation that had been living peacefully until just a few weeks ago. I want to note in particular the families and civilians killed in this aggression. At the start of this week the best records available—and we know this is probably an underestimation—noted that 1,151 civilians had been killed, of whom 103 were children. That is why it is important for this parliament to discuss this issue and that we continue to state very clearly that this federal parliament—not one side or the other, but this entire federal parliament—stands with the people of Ukraine. We stand with them in our communities, we stand with them in our electorates, we stand with them in the important forums of United Nations and we'll stand with them wherever the Australian hand of friendship is needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we do so? We do so with our tougher sanctions. We do so by acting with our allies wherever we can cooperate to prevent further lives from being lost. We do so by sending humanitarian aid and, indeed, by sending lethal aid. It's not something that Australia ever does lightly, but we do so because it is the right thing to do. We also do so by standing with our communities in peaceful protest. The opposition have very clearly said that we will continue to give bipartisan support to the Australian government for the provision of the economic and military assistance necessary for Ukraine. We'll support the sanctions against Russia, provide where necessary a safe haven for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict and provide support for Ukrainian Australian associations. I want to put on record my thanks to the DFAT officials who have been helping my constituents. I don't want to go into the details of those matters other than to say I'm very grateful for the work of DFAT and the work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and her office in assisting a number of my constituents in some incredibly difficult circumstances to both protect lives and to reunite families. As the member for Perth, I'm very grateful for that work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also been necessary for many of us to stand with our communities. I've stood with the Perth community in two separate vigils, including a 'Stop the War' rally held in the Supreme Court gardens on the banks of the Swan River, where the gardens and the parkland were covered in blue and gold. Normally, when we cover things in blue and gold in Western Australia, it's for the West Coast Eagles, but this was much more important. This was so that we could show the support of the people of Western Australia for the people of Ukraine. I commend the Lord Mayor of the City of Perth and the state government for lighting up a number of buildings and monuments across the state in blue and gold, including Council House. I want to thank everyone who attended the rally on 5 March, when they marched through the streets of Perth to show their support for peace. Then, at Saint Mary's Cathedral, which was built in 1865 and stands proudly in the heart of the Perth electorate, we gathered again in a vigil to show support for the people of Ukraine. That had a roll call of a range of consuls-general and a range of political leaders. I particularly note the attendance and the very heartfelt and strong speeches of Dr Tony Buti, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Interests; Senator Smith; the member for Stirling; Senator Cox; Senator Steele-John; and, indeed, Caroline Perks, who is the Greens's candidate for Perth. It was good to see the cross-partisan support shown very strongly in the heart of the Perth electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must continue to stand with Ukraine however we can and not let this slip off the agenda. This is not just an attack on one country but an attack on democracy the world over. This is an attack on the rules that keep all nations and all citizens, wherever they live, safe. It is an attack on our values and an attack on friends and people that are dear to our communities. While we can oppose this, we need to work in whichever ways we can to ensure this conflict does come to an end, and that that happens soon. I'll continue to campaign for peace in the Perth electorate until it does, and I look forward to hearing from President Zelenskyy tomorrow, when he addresses the parliament, about how Australia can further assist in the cause of peace. He is an inspiring leader, but we don't need inspiration. We simply need a path to peace. And we need it now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  It's been an extraordinary month, one of the most dangerous months since World War II. Russian aggression has moved into Ukraine, unjustified and unprovoked. It's completely unacceptable. There have been attacks near and around nuclear energy stations, attacks on civilian areas and attacks on the people of Ukraine—for no reason. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Vladimir Putin started invading Ukraine, emphatic statements were made in Australia that there is no justification for this war. That remains as true today as it was at the start of this conflict. There is no justification for this war. There is no justification for Russia to be in Ukraine at this moment. We would, again, urge Russia to withdraw their troops from Ukraine and stop the indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Macnamara, my electorate, we have one of the largest Ukrainian expat populations in Australia. Many of those who came from Ukraine did so at the fall of the Soviet empire, and did so late in their adult lives. They did so fleeing persecution from the Soviet empire. In coming to Australia as an adult, learning English wasn't really an option for many people. So finding work and a place in Australian society was a difficult transition for many people who came from Ukraine. Many in my electorate live in public housing. There is a Ukrainian community in some of the public housing areas in my electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are, at their core, deeply grateful to our nation for not only giving them safety but for giving them a home and allowing them time to come to this country in safety. Their families have gone on to give so much back to Australian society. Their kids have obviously been able to learn English. Many of the older migrants who came to this country did so in a pretty vulnerable state. They are kind and generous every time I go and visit them and are deeply distressed about the state of their families back home and the country they left behind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One interesting analysis about Vladimir Putin is that he doesn't use technology. He doesn't use smartphones. He constantly surrounds himself by advisers who are answering his questions. He doesn't use smartphones for a range of reasons, including not wanting to be trackable for international espionage. One of the outcomes of that, perhaps, is that he really doesn't understand the temperature on the ground in Ukraine. He has this romantic idea of Soviet Russia, that the people of Ukraine would welcome back the Russian forces from their European aggressors. But that is not what Ukraine is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ukraine is not a country that looks back in history at the Soviet era in the romanticised way Vladimir Putin wants it to. Ukraine is a vibrant democracy, a democracy that is forward leaning, that is full of arts and culture and political debate. It is the sort of country that we are proud to affiliate ourselves with. It is not an autocratic country. It is not a dictatorship. It is a vibrant democracy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the person who leads that vibrant democracy years ago found himself as an actor playing the President of Ukraine. He was so convincing in this portrayal that people said to him he should actually run to be the President of Ukraine. He was emphatically voted in with 70 per cent of the presidential vote. You'd think, 'How could a comedian tap into the sentiment of a forward-thinking, proud country like Ukraine?' But the way in which Volodymyr Zelenskyy has withstood the barrage, withstood the pressure, withstood the second largest military in the world, in terms of nuclear capability, and withstood the overwhelming capability of the Russian military on Ukraine's borders and inside Ukrainian territory has been heroic—absolutely heroic. I can't think of another figure in world politics, really since Nelson Mandela, who has been able to galvanise the international community in the way in which President Zelenskyy has. It will be an honour to hear him speak tomorrow in the Australian parliament. We wish him strength. We wish the Ukrainian people strength. We not only wish them victory on the battlefields, in their cities, but we wish them survival so that they can rebuild their amazing country, their country full of life and culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Canberra mentioned before, families have been separated due to the conscription of Ukrainian males who have been forced to stay behind while the females and the children have been at least given the option to flee. That has led to more than three million Ukrainian refugees leaving the country, an extraordinary number, putting huge pressure on Poland, on Romania, on Lithuania, on countries surrounding Ukraine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vladimir Putin came into Ukraine with a purpose of what he calls, outrageously, 'de-Nazifying' the Ukrainian people. It is an outdated Soviet mentality that aggression towards the Russian people is shrouded in Nazism. But, as we know, Nazism was something very, very different, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a grandson of Holocaust survivors. The extra sharpness of using that as a justification to invade Ukraine is simply abhorrent and another layer as to why this unjustified invasion of Ukraine is simply unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing I'll say is that some of the geostrategic consequences of Vladimir Putin invading Ukraine have been the exact opposite of what he intended when he invaded Ukraine. First of all, it is extraordinary—and it must be noted, as a friend and ally of many in the European Union—that Germany has completely changed its neutrality in terms of military activity, due to the aggression of Vladimir Putin. It is extraordinary that Switzerland has ended its neutrality and has provided aid to the Ukrainians in this contest. It is not insignificant, at this moment in history, that Vladimir Putin, through his aggression and his unjustified war in Ukraine, has galvanised NATO, united Europe and activated the Americans in a way such that there is now constant communication between the United States, NATO, Europe and allies like Australia around the world, to stand united against Vladimir Putin and his outrageous war in Ukraine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important, because the sanctions that we are using and implementing in Australia right now, the sanctions that are being used by Europe and by the United States, by President Biden, are being felt in Russia right now. The people of Russia are smart. They are alive to the fact that this is a deadly, unnecessary war and they are feeling the economic consequences of the international community's sanctions. We need to keep the pressure up, as international citizens. We need to keep the pressure on the Russian oligarchs, on the central power that surrounds Vladimir Putin. We need to stand in constant solidarity with the people of Ukraine. We wish them strength. Their bravery is truly historic and heroic. We wish President Zelenskyy only peace as he and his people fight for their survival. We look forward to welcoming him to the House of Representatives tomorrow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  This is an important debate, and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to rise to participate in it. I've been equally pleased to be present for the remarks of a number of my colleagues—the member for Canberra, the member for Perth and the member for Macnamara. I associate myself with their remarks and, of course, those of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, this debate is an opportunity for us in this place to express two things: our solidarity and our resolve. Both matter, and in my contribution I'll try, very briefly, to touch on why I think this is the case. Unlike my friend the member for McNamara, I don't represent a particularly significant Ukrainian Australian community. But, as Labor's shadow minister for multicultural affairs, I have had the opportunity—indeed, the privilege—to spend a lot of time recently listening to the voices of Australians of Ukrainian background. I have participated in some very moving occasions in the nature of those the member for Perth spoke about, be they church services or other community gatherings. I want to share with the chamber a couple of those occasions—firstly, a beautiful service at St Patrick's in Melbourne. It was well attended by the diaspora community—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr GILES:</span>
                  </a>  As I was saying, I was privileged to attend a very moving service at St Patrick 's Cathedral, around the corner from the state parliament house in Melbourne. I was gratified to see so many representatives of the wider community and faith leaders and political leaders in solidarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention a very significant event in the Victorian calendar, the Multicultural Gala Dinner, which took place a couple of weeks ago. The dinner was addressed by the Premier and by the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, Matthew Guy, who is of Ukrainian heritage. They both made very significant and passionate contributions in recognition of the challenges the diaspora community are facing as they confront the rolling images of a horrific, unjustified and unjustifiable conflict that brings home so many awful feelings beyond those which horrify the rest of us who lack that personal connection. That bipartisan commitment—indeed, multipartisan commitment—is I think what this debate also demonstrates in this House: a shared solidarity to the people of Ukraine but also recognising the extraordinary challenges that are faced by Australians who have Ukrainian heritage, for whom this conflict is all too close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the opportunity to listen to many Ukrainian Australians in recent days. I want to briefly reflect on a conversation I had with a young woman who came to see me in my office in Parliament House with Amnesty. I think my friend the member for Newcastle may also share some of these reflections. I was struck first and foremost by her strength and her courage, but also by how obvious it was that she was so affected by the challenge of conveying to me—and, no doubt, to others in this place—exactly what this meant to her; how the quotidian events of life in her home country had been so brutally upended and how the days that were marked on her calendar as significant family occasions had been replaced by a creeping sense of dread, of hopelessness and of powerlessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope, in this place, we can attend to those feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness. I don't think any of us presume to have all the answers to end that horrible conflict, but we know that, by showing the resolve that we—the government and the Labor opposition—have been showing, we can go some way towards that, in our expressions of humanitarian aid and indeed our support for lethal aid in these circumstances. I think all of us believe that is warranted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our recognition of the fact that Europe is facing the largest forced movement of people since World War II, and we are, as responsible international citizens and signatories of the convention, required to take the steps that we can do, to assist these people who've been forced to flee their homeland and ask for help, I am pleased to see the commitments in the budget—</span>

While I appreciate the steps that have been undertaken to offer refuge to people forced to flee the conflict, I just wanted to recognise again that we can do more, and we should, in doing more, listen to those voices closest to the ground and think about some of the steps that other wealthy countries that are also convention signatories have been taking, to assist people in such desperate need.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I am very honoured to be able to stand this evening to make a brief contribution with regard to the war against Ukraine. I think most of us in Australia were horrified to wake to the news of a Russian invasion that was, by all accounts, unprovoked and, indeed, unjustified. I found myself, for that first week or so, really glued to my devices, trying to follow everything that was happening in Ukraine and trying to understand something of what the Ukrainian people were going through. As is always the case in wars, there are thousands, if not millions, of innocent civilians—men, women and children. They are people we would have as part of our families, in our workplaces and in our neighbourhoods. They bear the brunt of the sheer brutality of war. This is the case in all wars and it is part of why war remains a reckless and senseless course of action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my privilege to host the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Anthony Albanese, when he visited the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Broadmeadow, just outside the city of Newcastle. Anthony Albanese and I lit a candle in solidarity with not only the Ukrainian community of the Ukraine Catholic Church in Newcastle but also with the Ukrainian-Australian community everywhere and those in Ukraine who were being subjected to horrific acts of violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As colleagues have said, Australia is united; we are united in this parliament, in our communities and in our condemnation of Vladimir Putin's unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine. I think there are many who might have been surprised by the sustained efforts of the Ukrainian people, but I can assure you that when the Leader of the Labor Party and I spoke to members of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Newcastle it was abundantly clear how determined the Ukrainian people were to defend their homelands, protect their peoples and stand against a senseless act of aggression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stories from people like Stefania in my electorate, who I met at the church, were truly heartbreaking. Stefania is a 96-year-old woman. She fled Ukraine from the Germans and Russians after World War II, and today her community has witnessed another generation of Ukrainians who are bravely defending their country again. I met with many members of the Ukrainian community on that day who were fiercely proud of their families back in Ukraine when they learnt of the role that they were playing to defend their country. When I heard the national anthem being sung in the church, I could feel, with every fibre in my body, the pride and determination of a group of people who have been to hell and back before and truly wish that this newer generation of family were not having to experience this. But, sadly for many Ukrainian people, especially those here in Australia who fled after World War II, this is a very familiar experience, one that cuts very deeply within their living memories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a lived experience for people like Stefania and people of her generation who fled a savage, war-torn Europe to find safety for themselves and their families. Without a doubt, they were urging decision makers in this parliament and parliaments across the globe to stand in solidarity with Ukraine at this hour of need. We should absolutely be doing everything we can to secure peace and ensure that it prevails in Ukraine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Zelenskyy will address this parliament tomorrow. I'm sure that will be a very moving moment for the Australian parliament. He has already addressed the parliaments of the United States, the European Union and the UK. It is fitting that we join the list of parliaments that he has addressed directly. We will learn firsthand of the situation and the needs of the Ukrainian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Father Paul Berezniuk in Newcastle, the father at the Ukrainian Catholic Church, for hosting me and the Leader of the Australian Labor Party for what was a very moving service, and for the heartfelt and heartbreaking conversations that we had with the congregation. I would also like to acknowledge Wolodymyr Motyka, the gentleman who has really been the spokesperson for the Ukrainian community in Newcastle. He has handled much of the media inquiries and done a lot of the public outward facing work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge a recent visit from a delegation from Amnesty International and the pain that Inna Proshkivska made very clear when she, as a young Ukrainian woman herself, tried to explain what was happening back in her home country, the devastation that people were feeling. The reports of indiscriminate bombardment that are occurring are offensive. Anybody who has respect for international law and order and who wishes to see world peace would be grossly offended by the indiscriminate bombardment that is taking place in Ukraine. It is estimated that the damage done to Ukraine is already worth in excess of US$100 billion. That is really incomprehensible, I expect, for most members of the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do wish to go back to an issue that the young Ukrainian woman, Inna, raised when she came to visit me with the Amnesty International delegation. It was deeply traumatic for her to have to relive these stories. She said that, whilst announcements from the Australian government last week concerning the temporary visas being offered to Ukraine in addition to the humanitarian program are absolutely welcome, there needs to be a more concerted effort from us so that the people on the ground in Europe know there is an option—not just the humanitarian program but also some temporary visas. She stressed that many people who are leaving Ukraine have nothing but the clothes on their backs, so being able to purchase an aeroplane ticket to Australia might not be possible for everybody. She wanted to ensure that people from Ukraine who want to come to Australia have that opportunity. So we might need chartered flights or offers to get people here—as well as the assurance that they will be assisted when they arrive, including pathways to permanency where that is desired.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the House for enabling me to make this contribution today. Thank you very much.</span>
