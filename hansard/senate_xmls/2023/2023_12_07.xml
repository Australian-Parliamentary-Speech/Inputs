In the chamber, after seeing six presidents and four openings of parliament, Fiona Gamble is retiring after 11 years serving the chamber.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WONG:</span>
                  </a>  I hear the interjections of those opposite. Unsurprisingly, at the end of a sitting session, what we see again is people on that side returning to home base—that is, 'We want lower wages and fewer protections for Australia's workers.' I was here for the Work Choices legislation and the various iterations of coalition attempts to undermine working conditions and wages in this country, and we know they will never change. I've got no doubt that, during this debate, they will make a lot of comments about procedure and process. The reality is that all of those arguments are a smokescreen, because we know that, no matter how much process or time there is to look at industrial relations legislation, the instinct and reflex of those opposite will always be for lower wages and fewer protections for Australian workers. It is in their DNA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is seeking to close the loopholes that certain employers use to undercut wages, conditions and safety for Australian workers. It will close the loophole that allows some employers to use labour hire to undercut agreed rates of pay; close the loophole whereby if a worker steals money from the till it's a criminal offence, as it should be, but if an employer steals their workers' wages it's not; close the loophole that allows large businesses to claim small-business exemptions during insolvency to avoid redundancy payments; and close the loopholes that undermine workers' safety by introducing a new criminal offence for industrial manslaughter along with providing better support for first responders with PTSD, better protecting workers who are subjected to family and domestic violence from discrimination at work and expanding the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to include silica. After today, the labour hire loophole will be closed, wage theft will be made a crime and workers will benefit from safer workplaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of these reforms this year will be life changing for workers across Australia—for those being ripped off through labour hire loopholes, for those whose wages are being stolen by their employer, for those who are dealing with PTSD on the front line and for those subjected to discrimination at work because they are experiencing family and domestic violence. We thank crossbench senators, particularly Senators Lambie and Pocock, for their constructive engagement on this bill. We look forward to continuing to engage with them on the remaining elements of the bill in the new year. The other important elements of closing loopholes include minimum standards for digital platform gig workers, road transport industry reforms and a better deal for casual workers who want to become permanent. The government is committed to proceeding with every remaining clause of the bill at the earliest opportunity next year, including the additional measures that were made through amendments in the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, the Senate has already agreed to the vast majority of these measures and argued on more than one occasion that they should be passed immediately. Those measures relate to first responders with PTSD, family and domestic violence discrimination, protection for workers to stop them missing out on redundancy payments they deserve and the expansion of the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency. The additional measures in today's bill which have been agreed are criminalising wage theft and closing the labour hire loophole. All of these are important measures in their own right, but they are also important to ensure that we protect the integrity of Australia's industrial relations system. We are protecting the integrity of the wages and conditions that have been fought for and earned across our economy. This is about that integrity, and this is about ensuring that protection of wages and conditions continues in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This a key part of the government's plan to help Australians with the cost of living. We know Australians are doing it tough. Stopping the underpayment of workers is an important aspect of dealing with this. We know those opposite—including from the interjections that we've had in this fortnight—have always had a view that one of the ways you run an economy is to ensure that you keep wages low. We heard Senate Hume during question time talking about why wages rises were bad idea because they contributed to inflation. They will never change, no matter what they say to Australian workers. They spent a decade in government deliberately keeping wages low. We know that they will always take that view. The Albanese Labor government takes a different view, and I move:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:28</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 that has just been presented to the parliament. Those on the coalition side of the chamber will always stand with the employers of Australia. Why do I say that? Because a basic fact that the Albanese Labor government just does not seem to understand is that employers create jobs. Governments don't create jobs. Governments put in place the economic framework that employers in Australia, the job creators of our country, need to lever off. They can lever off those frameworks to prosper, to grow and to create more jobs for Australians, which is what we on this side of the chamber want to see. You prosper, you grow and you create more jobs for Australians, and that means you're able to provide your employees with sustainable higher wages—or you can do what the Albanese Labor government is doing today and cut a deal with the crossbench.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that a deal has been cut. We don't have the numbers in this place. We were always opposed to the bad measures in this bill, which would have a negative impact on the employers of Australia. We always said we would support those elements of the bill that did good things for Australia. That is why we had supported the splitting off by Senator Pocock and Senator Lambie of four parts of the bill which we said we would happily have passed today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a devastating day for Australian businesses. Once again, the Albanese Labor government—and it's becoming more and more evident every single day—having said a lot about transparency before the election, having said that they would hold themselves high and that this would be a government like no other government when it came to transparency, has done a deal with the crossbench before the Australian Senate has even been given an opportunity to properly scrutinise this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at it. If Australian employers are not the winners today, guess what? That only means one thing for Australian employees. They're also not going to be the winners. You see, whilst employers need employees—it's a basic fact of life—employees also need employers. It's the employers who have the business. It's the employers who provide the employees with the job. It's the employers that pay the employees' wages. So I would have thought you'd stand up for the employers in Australia, because in standing up for the employers in Australia you actually stand up for the employees in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is some good news today. Of course, there's got to be good news. Good God—good grief—they wouldn't have done a deal if there wasn't some good news. So, congratulations! Give a big clap, everybody, to the ACTU and the Australian union movement, because, once again, you get one of your long list of demands. I have to say, it was a very impressive list of demands—nine years in the making, in fact, and 18 months in the delivery. Give those across the chamber credit! If you want to deliver for the unions, use your numbers and deliver for them—the unions who stand for themselves, the unions who stand for the Australian Labor Party. To the employers and, ultimately, the employees in Australia—guess what? You are nothing more and nothing less then a casualty of the deal that has been done today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a deal that, as I said, has been rushed into this chamber. I give you zero out of 10 points, Mr Albanese and Mr Dreyfus, when it comes to the transparency that you trumpeted before the election. That's zero out of 10 for standing up for the employers of Australia. But, I have to say, I'm not going to give you 10 out of 10 for standing up for the unions. I am going to give you bonus points. That is what we're seeing today—a deal struck with the crossbench, with Senator Lambie and Senator Pocock, to allow the unions in Australia access to workers around Australia and their businesses. They are the great winners out of the deal today. At its simplest, this is a government seeking to deliver a union agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures that we had in this bill—some will go through today and some, I assume, will go through next year—were designed for nothing more and nothing less than to deliver on declining union membership in Australia. Why do I say that? I say it because it is a fact. Union membership in Australia is at an all-time low. Okay, we accept that. So, when something so important to them is at an all-time low, what do they do? They abolish those forms of employment that can't be unionised. The union movement in Australia has long been hostile towards the labour hire sector. Why is that? Because people actually choose to work labour hire. They choose to exercise their right not to work for an employer. They choose to exercise their right to work in a fashion that they want to. In so doing, in exercising that choice, guess what? They don't join a union. So what do the government do? They attack labour hire in Australia and deliver for their union mates.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What will be the effect of what is going to happen today on employers across Australia? In the first instance, what I'd say is that the business community, along with the coalition, have always supported bringing forward measures that would improve worker safety. In fact, we were the ones that worked with the crossbench to split the bill and bring those elements on. It was Mr Burke who stood up in the parliament and in the press and said that under no circumstances would he ever split this bill. Given an opportunity to deliver on a union agenda, though, we don't need to worry about what he may have said in the parliament or in the media. The fact is that, today, he has done a spectacular backflip—10 out of 10 and an Olympic gold medal for the backflip that has been done. Guess what? The bill that we are debating today is a bill that, ironically, has actually split the fair work amendment bill in two.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I said, it's a devastating day for Australian businesses. It is a devastating day for the Australian businesses that are going to be impacted by the changes to labour hire in this country. As I said, businesses create jobs. Employers create jobs. Employees need employers. Employers need employees. If you as a government put in place an economic framework that allows an employer and their business to prosper and grow, they are able to create more jobs for Australians. Guess what? In prospering and growing, they are able to create more sustainable, high-paying jobs for Australians. That is certainly not what this element of the bill is going to do today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Merry Christmas to those employers across Australia who will be affected by this. I am going to call it a dirty deal because it is a dirty deal. I don't have a problem that a deal has been done. Deals get done in this place. What I do have a problem with is that the Senate had agreed that we would be able to inquire into and scrutinise this bill. We all knew that it would go through next year at some stage but only after it had been properly scrutinised. What I do have a problem with 18 months into the Albanese Labor government is that they trumpeted about transparency from the highest rafter before the election and yet time after time all we see now is a failure to answer anything basic in relation to their agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is a perfect example, Mr Burke stood up. We all know why Mr Burke had to stand up with—good God!—the train wreck in relation to immigration. A fourth detainee released by this government has been charged by police. You can see why they had to create a distraction. I have no issue with that. But why did they compromise the employers of Australia? Their own incompetence has led to the immigration debacle. It's because of three ministers and the Prime Minister, who is conveniently hiding. The Attorney-General, Minister Giles and Minister O'Neil compromised the safety and security of Australians. It has had a devastating effect on Australia and Australians. It's had a devastating effect on those Australians who have now been offended against by the people that this government released. But do they have to stand up in an attempt to distract from the train wreck which is the handling of the NZYQ case and say to the employers of Australia, 'We are prepared to compromise you,' given, in particular, the state of the economy at the moment?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industrial relations changes are incredibly important. In fact, I would argue that they are some of the most important changes and economic reforms an Australian government can make. The focus of any industrial relations reforms should be to make us more productive and to create more higher-paying, sustainable jobs. Those on the other side—and clearly the crossbench now, because yes, Senator Pocock and Senator Lambie, you are part of this deal—are delivering on the four elements of your bill that we supported you on. But by standing up here today with those opposite, given everything you have publicly said, you are now tarred by the same brush. So, the next time an employer speaks to you and ask why, I hope you've got a very good reason for why you were prepared to deliver this to them as a Christmas present from Senator Lambie, Senator Pocock, the Australia Greens—expect nothing less—and the Australia Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We backed you every step of the way in relation to the four measures that you wanted split off. It was Mr Burke who wouldn't. Why? I hope you disclose the deal that's been done today, because why would you stand here on the final day of the parliament for 2023 and walk back everything you have said to date? Why would you hand this, on the altar of the Australian Labor Party, to employers in this country who are affected by this, when they haven't had an opportunity to properly put their case? Merry Christmas to the Australian employers affected by this bill. Merry Christmas to the Australian workers whose employers will be affected by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do Australians actually need? Well, (a) they need a government that has their back. In the last three weeks, what have the Anthony Albanese Labor government shown Australians? I tell you, when it comes to your safety and security, Australia, I wouldn't take these people into battle with me. I know that if I had to look behind me they probably wouldn't be there. They don't care about the safety and security of Australians. They've made that very, very clear. They are prepared to make excuse after excuse after excuse for how they have compromised the safety and security of Australians over the past almost four weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then today, in an effort to distract from what everybody across Australia knows, there is this complete, total and utter trainwreck. As I said, I've got no issues about a deal being done; deals get done in this place. I would have thought it would have been nice, though, if a deal had been done, to put through the four elements of the bill that we all agree on. But instead, today those employers and those employees affected by this productivity-sapping measure are being given a merry Christmas from Senator Lambie, Senator Pocock and the Australian Labor Party. The economy we have at the moment in this country is a picture of middle Australia being crushed. Regarding everything that Anthony Albanese, the now Prime Minister, promised Australians before the election: on lower interest rates, you've got higher interest rates; on lower inflation, you've got persistently high inflation; on rents, people can't even afford to rent at the moment. And don't even get me started on energy prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, well done on sacrificing the employers of Australia and ultimately the employees who'll be affected by this productivity-sapping measure. Merry Christmas! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BFQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARBARA POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. The provisions in this bill are important. They will usher in changes to our workplace relations laws that will deliver real benefits and protections for Australian workers. The world of work in Australia is changing, and we need workplace law that plays catch-up. Too many Australian workers are not being paid what they are entitled to. They are robbed. Too many people, especially young people, are being robbed of their super and of their wages. Too many Australians are not being paid the same rate as the permanent worker alongside them because of confected arrangements by devious employers who want to get workers on the cheap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've listened carefully to Senator Cash's comments. She made no comment about wage theft. What does she think should happen for the millions of workers who lose their wages, who approach their retirement without being paid up to $3.4 billion a year in superannuation theft? Senator Cash has made a speech about jobs—about how jobs are everything and they are a contract between the employer and the employee. But it is not just about getting a job in Australia; these days it is also about the quality of the job that you get. If you do not get a job that offers you security of employment and does not offer you safety at work, then your life is on the line, and that is why this bill is important. It will make a difference. It will improve the lives of so many workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will simplify workers' access to compensation when they're suffering from PTSD. This is incredibly important to our police, our firefighters, our ambos and our emergency services workers, who do things every day that are critical to the functioning of our society: rescuing the sick, protecting the vulnerable and saving lives. We must support those workers who put themselves on the line for us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also add silicosis to the remit of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency. We do this on the day of the 20th anniversary of when we made asbestos illegal in this country. We need to do the same in relation to silicosis. This will help with setting up a national plan and coordinating efforts to tackle silicosis. That's important, but we need to do more. And this chamber only two weeks ago was in 100 per cent agreement that the cost being imposed especially on young people by silicosis is not acceptable. Every day that we delay banning the import of manufactured stone is costing workers their lives. We need to implement the recommendation of Safe Work Australia to put in place a national plan before 1 July 2024 to ban manufactured stone, which is killing Australians. We know silicosis is entirely preventable. We should be acting on that in ways that go further than what is in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also prohibit an employer from taking adverse action against a worker on the basis that the worker has experienced family and domestic violence. We have an epidemic of domestic violence in this country, and it affects so many women at work. We need to have support for workers in their workplace to deal with this epidemic. And we know it's on the rise. In my own state, there were five deaths in a single two-week period in recent times. Our labour law has to play catch-up because of the role it can play in protecting women and ensuring that the attacks on women, the damage to women, are shut down and that women are assisted by proper action in the workplace so that they get the support they need in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will close a loophole whereby small businesses don't have to pay redundancy to workers where they downsize due to insolvency. That's important when businesses go under. We need justice for workers, especially that last group of workers, who are often at the tail end of an extended period of redundancies. That's an important protection for those workers. The bill will close labour hire loopholes used to undercut wages and working conditions. Currently bosses can pay workers employed on labour hire contracts a lower rate of pay and offer them worse working conditions than staff. I just listened to Senator Cash say that's a device to avoid unionisation of those workers. That is rubbish. It is a device used to minimise the costs of labour for very large employers in Australia, and it is completely unfair. In inquiries we have heard evidence from worker after worker about $50,000 wage gaps, for example, in very big corporations which make billions of dollars in profit but who are not paying the workers working right alongside each other with the same skills and requests of them the same. They are underpaid. This loophole is used to exploit workers, and it has to be shut down. It is overdue for reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen very active campaigns by employers, pouring money into defending this kind of poor behaviour, this unfair behaviour, and misinformation campaigns trying to shoot down this amendment. It's important that we take action, and the Greens back it. I want to assure the Senate and the public out there that the sky is not going to fall because of this amendment. I have personally given evidence as a researcher at inquiry after inquiry for the last 30 years about the evidence on this question. I hate to invoke the ghost of Senator Abetz—a ghost of workplace relations Christmases past—but I've certainly sat opposite him many times when giving evidence on this question, and it is time that we face up to the reality that the sky will not fall when we see workers paid the same rate of pay for the same rate of work for the same job description for the same effort. It will mean fairness for those workers and for their families. They should be paid an appropriate rate of pay. Chicken Little has no role in this campaign and should not be financed in a campaign to attack the attempt to reform this part of our labour regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will criminalise wage theft. I was waiting for Senator Cash to mention wage theft. It is straightforward theft. It should be criminalised. It is worth billions of dollars in the Australian economy. Stealing wages from workers, especially workers with low bargaining power, like young women, young people and migrants, causes serious harm, and it is the most powerless who are most affected by wage theft. This is straightforward greed. It should be a criminal offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We Greens have worked very hard to extend that criminal offence beyond the straightforward matter of stealing from someone's pay packet to stealing from their future in the form of stealing their superannuation. With the passage of this legislation, it will be a criminal offence for an employer to intentionally not pay their workers the super they are owed. This amendment places that theft in a similar legal category to wage theft, exactly where it should be, and ensures that workers are protected against the boss who wants to avoid paying them what they're due. This is a big problem for casual workers, especially in hospitality, who may find that superannuation was stolen years after the fact. They've got no way of getting it back. It especially affects many women and those young people and migrants. It's an industry, a robbery, that's worth billions of dollars every year. On average, the workers being affected are out of pocket by $1,700 a year. That's around $3.4 billion that employers are holding onto which is due to working families and working people as they approach retirement. Superannuation is not an optional extra. It is a critical workplace entitlement, and it protects a decent life for Australians into their older age. Not paying it should be criminalised, and this amendment will make sure that happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will introduce new protection for union delegates so that they continue to play their vital role representing workers and advocating their rights. The changes enable greater communication with members and accessing workplace facilities. The changes will prevent an employer from unreasonably refusing to deal with delegates or obstructing them in any way. This is vital in terms of communication within a workplace, especially around matters like health and safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the issues addressed in this bill have been there for many years in front of us demanding action. They're matters which the Greens want to help the parliament step up to and deal with. They should all be passed in this parliament, and we need them. We need them as soon as possible, but we need a whole lot more. There are massive changes underway in our workplaces that must take us beyond dealing with the important emergency measures that are in this bill. We need to raise our eyes from those matters and consider the larger question of how our workplaces have changed and how our legislation around workplaces is slipping behind. Some measures missing from this bill are those incorporated in the original closing loopholes bill. The measures in the bill before us are urgent, but the other measures are also urgent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also attend to some very important, wide-ranging issues, like the epidemic of job insecurity, which affects one in four Australian workers on casual terms and a third of Australian workers in precarious employment. These workers run our universities. They teach our kids in schools. They serve us in restaurants. They hold up many elements of the health system. They are vital parts of our labour market, but they don't necessarily know, in many cases, what their hours will be next week or next year, and their casual loading does not compensate them for all that they lose—unpredictable ongoing employment and the loss of holidays, sick leave and so many other conditions, such as the opportunity to train on the job and to progress in a career. We need to see improvements in security for so many Australian workers. We also need to look after the growing army of gig workers, who are dropping food parcels to our workplaces and our homes and are such an important and growing part of our labour market. They deserve a right to safe work and to a minimum wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the question of the right to disconnect, which I have spent many minutes talking about in this chamber. Over Christmas, many Australians are going to be answering their emails, picking up their phone, responding to their employer and trying to stay sweet with their work and keep their job secure by responding when they get some kind of contact through their device from their boss. There are many countries who now recognise this is a pernicious labour market practice that costs people their health. It costs people their family time and it steals their working hours from their communities. We have to see a right to disconnect in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ongoing casual workers must have more opportunity to convert to employment where they are in ongoing employment, to be protected by consistent hours and pay. They should receive—and we saw the cost of it in the pandemic—paid sick leave and paid holidays. The casualisation in our workforce has eroded workers' protections, and the casual loading does not even begin to compensate for those changes. Workers are reliant on their wages to live, and they deserve certainty about their working time and their pay so they can put food on the table. I know, from a great deal of evidence that we took in the Senate Select Committee on Work and Care, how many people in our supermarket chains have no predictability about their working time. They cannot tell what their pay packet will be next week. Their boss can tell you how many Granny Smith apples will be in row 5 next Wednesday morning, but they can't tell their workers exactly what hours of work they'll have next week. We need much more predictability around working time and roster justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, we need to improve conditions for gig workers. Many of them are an important part of our economy, but they pay too much in terms of their own health and safety and their low pay for their jobs that they are desperate to do—so many of them immigrant workers and powerless in our labour market. I've sat in hearings listening to family members talk about the loss of their children, of their nephews and of their kids in unsafe working conditions, killed on the job delivering our food and the objects and goods we want delivered to our homes. We cannot run our labour market on the lives of those workers, and we cannot have them doing their work systematically, year after year, on wages that are well below the minimum wage. We have to improve our protections for gig workers. Next year I'm hoping we're going to see real change to protect those gig workers to keep them safe and make sure they get the minimum standards that every Australian worker since Federation has thought is an important right—that if you give your time to an employer, then you have a right to be safe at work and have enough food on your table and predictable working time. We need to extend minimum standards and we need to include in those minimum standards the rates of pay and safe working conditions. We Greens will continue to fight for these changes to be passed next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also see next year a real improvement alongside other countries in that right to disconnect, so that people can save their time that they are not paid for for their families, their communities and their own health. Unpaid overtime is a multibillion-dollar problem that robs Australian workers and communities of our time. On average Australian workers are donating seven weeks a year to their workforce. That is wrong. It affects their health, it affects their families and it affects their communities. We're doing some really important things today that will make a difference, and will narrow inequality in our labour market and protect people who can least defend themselves, but we've got a lot more we need to do. We need to make sure we protect the working time of Australians so they have predictable hours and predictable pay. We need to make sure we aren't running our industries on workers who are unsafe driving around in our streets and paid well below the minimum wage—many of them, we've seen in recent times, potentially subject to the risk of losing their lives. We need to improve immediately the protections around silicosis which affect so many young people, and we need to introduce real improvements across the labour market.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:59</span>):  What a performance by Senator Cash this morning! I had to reset in here because I wasn't sure if I was in the Australian Senate or on <span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ome and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">way</span>, let's be honest. What a joke this has been!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Australian people can see what Independent crossbenchers can actually get done for the better. The Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 is a big one and it will impact on many Australians and Australian businesses. That's why Senator Pocock and I wanted to split out some of the elements, so we could have time to go through the rest very carefully over the limited time we have over the Christmas period. I would like to thank the minister and his office for coming to the table and working constructively so we could get more protections in place for Aussie workers as soon as possible. I'd also like to thank the minister for agreeing to initiate an independent inquiry into Comcare, which is about 20 years overdue. It has a lot of the same problems as the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and they are problems that need to be fixed. I'm also grateful that the government has agreed to give extra resources to the Fair Work Ombudsman to help small businesses understand their obligations under this legislation. I also thank Senator Pocock and his amazing team, as per usual, for working with my team to get the job done. I know the blue team may not be very happy today about some elements—but I also want to thank you for getting us to this point and for your stance with us over the initial four elements that we wanted to get through for those people affected by PTSD, domestic violence and silicosis and, of course, the redundancy on small businesses and making sure that people get paid. I really do, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for that; otherwise, we wouldn't have got this stuff through before Christmas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think if you ask most Australians if they thought every elected MP in Canberra could work together and get the best outcome for the Australian people, they would say, 'Yeah, why don't we see more of it?' Well, today we've seen it. Workers will get these protections from the beginning of next year. That means that federal first responders won't have to prove they have PTSD—and, I tell you, thank God for that—before they can get help. Can you imagine what it's like being in trauma and having to prove that? I would like to acknowledge Tasmania's Simone Haigh. Simone lost a very dear mate, a first responder who took his life because he didn't get the help he needed—and he is just one of many. Simone has pushed very hard for an inquiry, and Senator Anne Urquhart has backed her all the way. Your inquiry that finished in 2019 has made a significant difference. Also, this includes Border Force. I am working with the minister and hoping that Defence will follow suit as soon as possible so that veterans also don't have to prove they have PTSD before they can get the help that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want you guys to know that we are onto this. Unfortunately, this goes over a few acts, and it has not been simple to get this done this year. But I have been promised we will get onto this in the first quarter of next year and make sure this is fixed. I know the detriment it has on you and your families along with the other injuries that you carry alongside your PTSD. I have seen what it does to you and your families, and I want it stopped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The passing of the first part of the closing loopholes bill also means that people who are suffering from family and domestic violence can't be sacked or discriminated against because of that abuse. It brings silica in line with asbestos so we can have national rules for silica and we can start gathering national data. The majority of Australians suffering from silicosis are in their mid-30s. They're our sons. They're our daughters. We need to do all we can to eradicate exposure to this horrible goddamn disease. Passing the closing loopholes bill—let's call it 'part 1'—also means that workers who have worked for larger businesses that are facing insolvency get the redundancy payments they deserve. It also closes the loopholes in labour hire exploited by companies like Qantas, who have not helped their own situation. We give you a little bit, and you take the whole kit and caboodle. Seriously, with the amount of profits that you people make—big mining, big gas—you do not pay your people properly? You have brought this on yourselves. You have brought this on yourselves, and you should be ashamed of yourselves. So you're going to lose a little bit more of your profit. I tell you what—it wouldn't even be a sneeze in a hanky. You won't even notice it. Sometimes labour hire works. But you big corporations are abusing it, like I said, and you're cutting corners to beef up your profits. Quite frankly, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Merry Christmas to you!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Pocock and I also agreed that we needed to address wage theft and the nonpayment of superannuation. But we insisted on safeguards to protect and help small businesses so they would have time to understand the new rules. Small businesses are doing it tough, and many of them are still dealing with the impact of COVID-19. All of the small businesses and large businesses that I know in Tasmania want to do the right thing by their workers. Part 1 of the closing loopholes bill also makes industrial manslaughter a criminal offence. It is way overdue. Andrea Madeley, an Adelaide mum, has campaigned hard for laws on industrial manslaughter for nearly 20 years. Her son Daniel was just 18 and operating a horizontal borer in South Australia when his dust coat got caught in the spindle and he was pulled into the machine. He suffered horrific injuries and passed the next day. The campaign got industrial manslaughter criminalised in South Australia and, I am sure, helped to pressure the federal government to act. It is a shame that, in this place, it has taken to so long, and we've lost so many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 10 years, 87 Tasmanians have lost their lives at work, and there has not been one criminal conviction—not one. The minister has also agreed to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to address the ongoing issues of how independent medical assessments are used and are actually killing people, because that is the truth. They are pushing people to the brink. There is nothing worse than when you have your own psychiatrist or your own specialist that reports that they've seen you for 10 years but when you go and see some specialist for 15 minutes they say there is nothing wrong with you. Where is the fairness in that? They spend no time with you, and the department only gives them the documents that they want to give to make the department look good and miss everything else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what happens in DVA and Comcare, and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Many of these independent assessors are also contracted by the Commonwealth. That means they're paid a nice little penny. Guess what they do to keep their job? That's exactly how they act. If that hasn't been a conflict of interest for years and years, I don't know what is. You're paying them to go against us in a 15-minute consultation and paying them 3½ or four grand for a report where they did not have the full information in the first place. How can they possibly make a determination in that amount of time?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 will be up next year. This includes looking at minimum standards for digital platform workers and the gig economy, as it is called. It's a good name—the gig economy—and I'm sure that to all those people out there, especially you young guns, it sounds really cool. But we need to make sure these gig companies are being fair to the Aussies who are working for them. This is quite complicated. I want to be very, very clear about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also be looking at the road transport reforms. I like many parts of these reforms. I come from a trucking family. My dad drove trucks for 45 years. The big supermarkets pressure truckies into contracts that don't work for owner-drivers. As I've said, some of that is good, but my concern is that the small owner-drivers are treated like the big supermarkets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also look at casual workers who want to become permanent. This also needs to be looked at very carefully. There are some negative impacts in that bill. Some retailers are already doing the right thing. I say this nicely, but I imagine that's because the unemployment rate is down to about 3½ per cent, so you're doing everything you can to see your employees. It will be very interesting to see, once that goes up, whether that will stay in place. I have my doubts. I will give it to Target, though, at this point in time. I've heard some employees from Target in Tassie are already being offered work in a permanent role after just six months of filling a casual position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say: it is better to treat your people properly, give them full-time jobs and do that sort of stuff, because it brings morale. And morale—here's some common sense for this side—brings productivity. That's how it works. They work hand in hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to be careful about the impact on the smaller businesses. We're already aware that they are exempt, and we want to make sure that that stays in place and there aren't unintended consequences for small businesses from this, even though they are exempt. I will work in good faith with the government—as we always do, regardless of who's in government—and the minister on part 2 of the closing loopholes bill. But I can assure you that it is a long way from being a free pass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have an open-door policy. I always have. I will talk to everyone and treat everyone the same, whether you're a minister, a senator, a stakeholder or an everyday Australian. That's why the Jacqui Lambie Network doesn't take money from big corporate donors or unions. We do not want to be fogged when we are making our decisions. We want to do the best thing by the nation moving forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Tyrrell and I consider legislation, we look at it from all angles and ask, 'What's best?' That's it. It's as simple as that. It's not that we're worried about losing our seats because we don't have the money to buy them. I want to make sure that is quite clear. We earn them. That is our biggest pride in the Jacqui Lambie Network. We have to earn them. We cannot buy them, nor can we be bought. I will never allow anyone who comes in here, if there are more in the future, to be put in that situation where they are bought. It's not on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be commentators today that will accuse Senator Pocock and I of doing a deal early. To be honest with you, I don't care. Some will say we should have just passed the whole bill. Well, unfortunately, we can't. What we are doing is working as fast as we can with the limited resources we have and relying very heavily on people that we can't afford to pay who are sitting in the middle of all of this. They don't work for unions or big business. We have to rely on their time, free of cost. That's where we're at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we set out to do from the beginning was to look at this bill with cool heads and to look at what was uncontroversial and we could get passed and what parts of the bill needed more time to consider the impacts. That is what has happened here today. We will work constructively, once again, with the government and the minister and do everything that we can to try to work out the second half of the bill. Once again, I want to make clear we believe this is the right thing to do. I'm sick and tired of hearing of miners who are doing the same job getting paid $30,000 less than their mates or of having their mates coming to me and saying, 'It's so unfair that I get an extra 30,000 bucks because I'm not working for a labour hire company.' This labour hire crap, I will tell you now, is way off the radar. There is no other way to put it. It is absolutely being taken advantage of by the big boys in town and it is going to stop. What saddens me more than anything is the profits that they make they scrounge off their own workers. They seriously lack a conscience, and that is a problem. It's all about profits instead of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So now we are going to fix that. It won't even take a bite out of their profits. We would never have had to do this if they had just done the right thing in the first place, and that is the truth of the matter. Profits over people is going to stop. It is uncalled for and it is unneeded. It does not help productivity in a workplace. I don't care what they say. It does not. Happy workers, happy profits—that's how it works.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  The sausage factory has been in overdrive this morning. The old saying is that the making of laws is like the making of sausages and it's best not seen. I have seen many deals done in this place where governments have negotiated with crossbenchers or oppositions to ultimately get things done quickly. But I struggle to think of another circumstance where so much complexity has been undertaken in such a way, so lacking in transparency, as has occurred this morning and as is happening with the legislation before us. The sausage factory being run by the Labor Party is determined to take hundreds and hundreds of pages of proposed legislation and split it into two bills. At 9:28 this morning, as we started deliberation on these bills, I was finally handed the two bills. I didn't see them before we started this debate, and we're going to have to vote on them in less than two hours time. That's the way this is being treated. So we're voting on one of the bills, which runs for 133 pages, and the government is deferring until next year the contents of the other bill, which runs for 183 pages. Is anybody in this chamber going to have the time and capacity, before we have to vote, to properly read, properly absorb and properly understand exactly how the government has carved this up? No, they're not, because the sausage factory is operating, showing absolutely no respect to the processes of the Senate, no respect to those senators who were not part of whatever deal was struck and no regard to proper scrutiny, transparency or accountability—all of which the Labor Party had previously promised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again this government is demonstrating that they have absolutely no interest in transparency, no interest in accountability and no interest in proper processes. When they get the numbers they will ruthlessly use them and ram through whatever it is they are doing. And that's what's happened here. One bill that was not scheduled to be voted on until next year after a Senate committee had concluded its work has, with absolutely no notice, been split into two bills this morning. And everybody is left scrambling to understand how the Labor Party sausage factory has determined which parts have gone into the bill we have to vote on today and which parts will be left to be determined next year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get clear some of the facts in this matter, because Labor likes to come in here and make a whole range of outrageous claims, particularly about where the coalition stands. The truth is we have, in the scrutiny of the large omnibus bill that's been before this Senate for some time, indicated for some time a willingness to pass provisions that we think are reasonable, that we recognise are appropriate and that should have consensus across the chamber. So we've passed provisions that relate to small business redundancy exemptions, we've passed provisions that relate to strengthening protections against discrimination, we've passed provisions that relate to asbestos safety and eradication and we've passed provisions that recognise the critical role of first responders and provide additional protections for them. So don't let anybody believe the lies that will be told from the other side and the claims that are being made to suggest that we don't support those elements. We do support those elements. We have voted for those elements. We have passed that legislation. We sent it to the House of Representatives weeks ago. We have sent multiple messages to the House of Representatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party chose to hold up those provisions because they had other priorities. Their priority wasn't about asbestos safety, it wasn't about first responders, it wasn't about protections against discrimination and it wasn't about small business redundancy exemptions. No. Their priorities were, of course, about delivering for mates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are being asked to pass this bill under guillotine today. The government has forced this chamber to have to vote in just a couple of hours' time or less. Then it will be rushed over to the House of Reps, and no doubt they'll have even less time to debate it before the government ruthlessly uses its numbers to ram it through there. In the limited time I've had to have a look at this bill that is being rushed through today, I see that one of the things in here—in addition to the four elements that we have indicated we support—is part 7 of schedule 1, 'Workplace delegates' rights'. It's 'merry Christmas' to the trade union movement from the Labor Party. That's what this is all about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They could have passed all of the other non-controversial elements quite happily weeks ago with bipartisan support. But, oh no. They held those elements hostage to greater rights for the trade union movement. That's what this is about—delivering a Christmas present to union delegates. And let's be clear, it is a Christmas present to union delegates, because what does the bill say underneath 'Part 7, Workplace delegates' rights'? It says, 'Amendments commencing day after Royal Assent'. So these increased rights for the trade union movement will take effect as soon as these bills have passed the parliament and got the rubber stamp from the Governor-General. They'll be in effect probably by next week, and union delegates will have additional powers across this country before Christmas.</span>

                    </a>  There we go. Thank you, Senator Pratt, for making clear that's your priority. Your priority is the union delegates and their rights. Let me have a look elsewhere in here. Schedule 4, part 1 relates to industrial manslaughter. Guess when that commences? It's 1 July next year. There's Labor's prioritisation. Union delegates get immediate rights. Let's put that through! But for all we hear from the Labor Party about industrial manslaughter and such issues, that's a lesser priority. They were happy to hold asbestos provisions and provisions of first responders hostage to getting more union rights. They were happy to equally prioritise union rights ahead of their industrial manslaughter reforms, because it's 'merry Christmas' to the trade union movement. It's about the rights they are being given. Rights that even ensure the right of entry, as Senator O'Sullivan highlighted before, and rights that even override enterprise agreements that are struck. That's the remarkable part of what's in here. An enterprise agreement has gone through all of the processes—processes this government has tightened even further—to get agreement between employers and employees about how their shared workplace will work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Cash so rightly put it, none of this works without employers. None of it works without successful, profitable employers. I'm happy to say that word, 'profit', because without it you don't have jobs. Without it you don't have businesses. Without it you don't have an economy. Successful, profitable, cooperative, harmonious workplaces where they reach agreement around an enterprise agreement, and reach terms in that enterprise agreement about how unions might operate in that business sounds pretty reasonable doesn't it? Employers and employees work together—'Here's our enterprise agreement. Everyone's agreed on that. As part of that we agree how unions operate within the workplace. Is that okay?' Not under this law it's not, because they'll just override the enterprise agreement to give even greater powers to the union movement. So don't anybody be conned today in terms of the legislation that is before us. The Labor Party, in pursuit of this legislation, have shown their true colours and their priorities, and the priority they are pursuing is, of course, about giving their union mates the Christmas present they want.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this element and others that we have concerns about so serious? Because it goes to the state of the Australian economy and the operation of businesses across the Australian economy. This week we had the latest national accounts released, and they showed that for the last quarter in Australia GDP per capita went backwards by half a per cent. In simple terms, that means on average every Australian was half a per cent less well off in terms of the size of the economy and how you'd carve that up for everybody. Of course, actually, most households and individuals know they're much worse off than that. Most households have seen interest paid on mortgages go up 7.6 per cent over the last year or so, price increases of 9.2 per cent since the election of the Labor government, and their real household disposable income fall 6.6 per cent over the last year on a per capita basis. Australian households are 6.6 per cent worse off per person. And people know there are challenges around the world. Do you know what the comparative analysis of data shows about real household income? It shows that there has been a bigger decline in real household income in Australia than in any other advanced economy. Australian households have gone backwards by more over the last year than in any other advanced economy. That is the real tragedy, the pain being borne by Australian households.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the drivers of these bad economic statistics are poor productivity in the Australian economy. Now, many advanced economies are struggling with productivity at present—it's not an unusual problem—and we've all been working to try to get productivity growing faster. But do you know what these reforms do?</span>

                    </a>  They actually stifle productivity. Senator O'Sullivan, you're right. These will hurt the ability of our economy to be more adaptable, to ensure that their work and their embrace of new technologies, of flexible workplace arrangements, of consensus in workplaces, will be stifled and hurt. Productivity will hurt and be damaged further as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that because the immediate reaction from business this morning has been to see that this is a devastating day for Australian businesses. It's a devastating day because it is going to constrain businesses and their ability to be as productive and successful as possible. And the more productive they are, the more successful they are, the more they are able to grow, the more they are able to employ, the more they are able to pay and the more tax they can contribute. That is the virtuous cycle we seek to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, of course, we need and support strong, effective industrial relations laws in our country. As I said earlier, we have been arguing for weeks now that the non-controversial elements of these laws should be passed as they relate to small business redundancies, to protections against discrimination, to asbestos safety and to greater rights for first responders. We've been there. We backed that. We support this. It's the damaging elements buried in this legislation that we oppose, and we oppose them out of interest for all Australians because ultimately a weaker Australian economy is going to hurt everybody in the long run. A weaker Australian economy will see fewer jobs available for people in the future. There will be less well paid jobs, despite what the government may say. A weaker economy will see so many of those who get to negotiate getting poorer outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and its sausage-machine factory on legislation, is letting Australians down today. It's a devastating and disappointing day for what it will mean for our economy, and the way the Labor Party have brought this forward to this place today is a shame on them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  After years and years of advocacy and far too many lives lost, today the parliament is taking concrete action to turn that around. Reversing the onus for approving PTSD on first responders will save lives. For police officers, firies and ambos, for those taking the calls from people in emergencies and for Border Force it will save lives from 1 January next year if this bill, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023, goes through the parliament today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Senator Cash and the opposition for supporting these important changes and for working with us to see the will of the Senate deliver for first responders. I thank Minister Burke, Senator Urquhart and the government in general for working with us to get this done this year. I'd like to acknowledge Tasmanian paramedic Simone Haigh and the many others who have pushed for more recognition and support for first responders. This is the first step in implementing the Senate Education and Employment References Committee's report <span style="font-style:italic;">The people </span><span style="font-style:italic;">behind 000</span>. There is clearly much more work to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge Vince Parnell and all the Heart2Heart walkers, who travelled nearly 3,000 kilometres from Australia's red centre to Canberra to ask for greater mental health support for first responders. I'd also like to thank Billy Brooks, from Emerge &amp; See; Jim Arneman, from the Australasian Council of Ambulance Unions; Greg McConville, from the United Firefighters Union; and Alex Troy and the team at the Australian Federal Police Association.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ambos, cops, firies and emergency service workers have met with me over the last 18 months and shared their stories of pain and what they and their families have been going through. I thank them all for their advocacy, their bravery and their service. I hope this goes some way to showing that this parliament has their back. I thank Senator Lambie for the enormous good faith, passion and commitment she brings to this cause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review of Comcare will also be a game changer, as will amendments to the SRC Act to change how independent medical examinations are used. The constant retraumatisation of first responders must stop. I met last week with someone who has had 27 independent medical examinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I apologise to the people we have let down, the families who have seen their loved ones not get the recognition and support that they need and deserve from us. The parliament has heard you and decided to change this, but we have to acknowledge that for some this has come too late. The tears of mothers and families, like Kay Catanzariti, should no longer be shed in vain. Long overdue changes to industrial manslaughter will help make sure that workers come home safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the midst of a national crisis of women being murdered, in far too many cases by their intimate partners, changes to better protect people experiencing family and domestic violence are also welcome. I note the coalition's strong support for that. This is concrete action in the 16 days of activism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional protections for small business are also part of today's agreement. In addition to important worker safety measures, these changes will help stop workers being underpaid. In this cost-of-living crisis, where real wage growth has stagnated for so long and too long, protecting people's pay has never been more important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">BHP and Qantas have ripped off workers for far too long now. We've rightly seen in the Senate the coalition, with Senator McKenzie and Senator Dean Smith leading the charge, holding companies like Qantas to account for their behaviour and going after CEOs like Alan Joyce, but we're not seeing their support to close down the practices that these same companies and CEOs employ to make sure they make a profit, get their performance bonus and walk away with tens of millions of dollars, while the workers who are handling the luggage and who are on flights get ripped off. This clearly needs to stop. Australians do not want the people who serve them on planes, who will be there to help keep them safe in an emergency, to be employed by 12 different companies and to be constantly undercut. This is clearly a loophole that needs to be closed. There are clearly legitimate uses of labour hire, but we know that some employers are using it to pay workers less. This will stop with this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Intentional wage theft should be a criminal offence, and now it will be, as will the non-payment of super. This is only intentional wage theft, because we know that mistakes are made. In this legislation we've ensured that small businesses are looked after, with these provisions not starting until the small business code is in place and, as Senator Lambie said, there is further resourcing for the Fair Work Ombudsman to engage with small businesses. We know that small business owners are flat out. Many of them are struggling to simply keep their small business going as well as pay the mortgage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said from day one that this bill was too big to be dealt with all at once, and that's why a number of complex measures will be dealt with next year. The Senate committee has hearings for 22 January and will hand down its report on 1 February. These are complex, economy-wide reforms, like changes to casuals, and will rightly be dealt with next year. I recognise how important things like protections for gig workers are, but it's critical that we get that right for a growing area of our economy where we're regulating across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time I hear a first responder recount their experience of trying to live with PTSD and the impact that it has on their families, the urgency of doing better is brought home to me. That's why we're here—to do better. This week, the other place farewelled one of its best—the member for Dunkley, the irrepressible Peta Murphy. Peta said, 'What is politics for if not to make a difference?' And she was right. Today we will make a difference.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  Today we rise to another deal done by the Labor Party, the Greens and the crossbench. It is another day of a lack of transparency and accountability. We have just listened to Senator Pocock talk about process, but the deal he has done with the Labor Party has meant that due process isn't followed in this place. In fact, the very Senate inquiry that was set up to investigate and to hear from those who are genuinely impacted by these industrial relations changes won't actually be able to be dealt with. Is he actually suggesting we're going to come back in a couple of months time and amend the legislation that's being slammed through the Senate today? I bet he's not, but he talks a big game in terms of wanting to hear from people and wanting legislation to reflect concerns, while simultaneously passing legislation without those concerns being relevantly dealt with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing here today is further proof that Labor's IR laws are bad laws. They've been poorly drafted. That is why we've seen a slew of amendments brought to the parliament, as if Tony Burke didn't have enough time to get it right! This is nothing more than an attempt by the Labor Party to get their failure on border protection and detainees off the front pages of every tabloid, off the front pages of the major broadsheets and off the radio waves in suburbs and regional centres around the country so they can go out on a win. And yet, despite having all the time in the world to get this legislation right, the Labor Party has got amendment after amendment after amendment after amendment. When you're in government, it's pretty embarrassing to have to amend your own legislation. You accept that you have to come into the Senate and maybe deal with some amendments from the opposition or the Greens or the crossbenchers, but to have to amend their own legislation to such a significant level just shows how incompetent the industrial relations minister actually is. Rather than wait for the Senate inquiry to hand down its findings and to therefore incorporate those needed amendments on the basis of evidence, again, they're drafting in the back room on the side chambers of the Senate today in a desperate attempt to get their failure on detainees off the front pages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Labor is seeking to do today is to make it harder for Australian's who've put their own capital on the line to run a business, who've put their own homes—mortgaged to the hilt—on the line to run a small business, who have farms that are hot to the hilt, or who are owner-operator truck drivers. They're making it harder and harder for those Australians across the country who believe in their own work ethic, who believe in building a better future for their children. Labor are making their job harder by the legislation that is before the Senate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You're going to make it harder for them to make a living and harder for them to employ other Australians. It is absolute anathema in this place. Year on year the Labor Party, the Greens and some of the crossbench seem to think that government employment is the way forward. The fact is, it is private enterprise—small businesses, millions and millions and millions of Australian families—who put down their own hard-earned money and hock the future of their children in order to build a business and employ others. When you make it harder for them to do that, you make it less likely that they will employ other people. They'll just stay small so that they don't actually take on those extra workers, don't actually grow.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the government is returning to parliament to rush through a further bill to pursue the ACTU's long list of demands is all the proof needed. The fact that the only promises this government has made—the only legislation it's focused on in its 18 months, the only ticks it can have against its report card of 'What have you done for me lately?'—is to the ACTU. Labor premiers were shafted in the infrastructure funding. With the NDIS, tough decisions have been kicked down the road until probably after the next election. Education hasn't improved. The only thing that has been done is the long list of demands the ACTU had for Tony Burke and Anthony Albanese in response to getting them elected.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While they were distracted by the disastrous and divisive $450 million Voice referendum, the government was unable to keep government spending under control. They were all very happy to blame inflation on something happening overseas. Well, sorry: the RBA governor has another perspective; it is absolutely homegrown, and it is because you've added $188 billion of additional spending to the budget. That's not overseas. That is decisions being taken by this government. You've been unable to manage the inflationary pressures. You've got no plan to deliver on the cost-of-living pressures that families are experiencing now. Income has fallen by 6.6 per cent. Taxes have gone up by 27 per cent. Mortgages have tripled. Prices have gone up by nine per cent. They are the facts, on your watch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it any wonder Australians are feeling smashed? And day after day you come in here and make little decisions that accumulate into the fact that it's going to be harder for Australians to get ahead, not easier. You've got no plans to grow the national economy and you've ripped $10 billion out of regional programs from the budget. And after 18 months, no new program funds have been provided to support regional communities. So, you've ripped it out, and for 18 months local councils and regional capitals have had nothing to replace that investment in their future in their communities. You've been unable to deliver on an infrastructure plan. You've got no plan to address congestion, while you're pouring 1½ million additional people into our already-congested suburbs. And you've been unable to deal with the aviation sector, where you've been consumed with protecting your old mate Alan Joyce and a corporate entity in Qantas that does not have the best interests of its customers or its shareholders at heart.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what you've actually achieved in the last 18 months, other than ticking the box on the ACTU's Christmas list. Throughout it all, the Labor Party and Minister Burke have remained focused on delivering your union mates' agenda. You're going to deliver on your big corporate mates' agenda, and you're delivering on your union mates' agenda. Do you know who gets screwed over? Small businesses—mums and dads living in the suburbs and dealing with the cost-of-living crisis, which even the Reserve Bank has recognised is homegrown and sits squarely at your feet. Today, on the last sitting day of the year—the last possible moment—you've stitched up a dodgy deal, and it will not have the scrutiny of a Senate committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are laws that threaten to force up the cost of services, especially those that are being delivered by self-employed contractors. That's because you hate that idea; you want everyone to be a potential union member. What about the young apprentice who finally gets their ticket and wants to launch out on their own and set up their own business? You'd much rather they worked for Lendlease or Grollo, or someone else, because then you can have the CFMMEU come in and say, 'Mate, have I got a deal for you!' That is actually the type of Australia you want to see. Walking into the parliament today with this sudden dodgy deal, you're undermining all the confidence that's needed by business to grow the economy. You just keep taking a sledgehammer to people's aspiration and desire to work hard and get ahead, not to clock on nine to five. That's fine; that's an individual choice. But if you actually want to work 18-hour days for 10 years and get ahead then you should be backed in, because that's actually what grows the economy. More government spending here in Canberra does not lift the productivity of this nation. I hope the Treasurer spends this summer writing another thesis, another 18,000-word essay, on what he's actually going to do to lift productivity and grow our economy over the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the National Party leader, I know these laws will impact my community, where small business is the backbone but the farming community is also significant. The National Farmers Federation have been running a national campaign to keep farmers farming, because this government's legislative agenda is making it harder to grow the food and fibre we need not just to put the food on the table of every Australian but to export around the world. They've said that the government's closing loopholes bill is fraught with issues that will make it harder and more expensive than ever to create employment opportunities in farming. I know there are not many farmers in the ACT, Senator Pocock, but there are in Tasmania.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's going to be the lived experience of farmers across the country through the passing of Labor's industrial relations bill. I grew up in a small business, where we lived at the dairy. You are now allowing union thugs—John Setka and his mates—to be able to walk into your home and check out whether it meets their exceptional standards. It is an absolute joke. It's not just farmers but a whole lot of Australians who live where they work, and the Labor Party don't believe that union officials should be required to hold an entry permit under the Fair Work Act. This bill shows no respect for the tens of thousands of business operators who expect the protection of the law before union heavies can enter their home.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have no agenda for relieving the cost-of-living crisis affecting Australians. That's why they've made a cumulative number of decisions that make things worse for Australians, not better. They've introduced a ban on live sheep exports. They've stripped water out of farming communities, which will provide no greater assurance for the environment. They've increased truckie taxes. They've put a fresh food tax on farmers. They've scrapped the agriculture visas and changed the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme to make it unworkable for primary production. They've been too slow to act on fire ants. They've taxed superannuation. They can't even tell us what impact that will have on primary producers in unrealised gains. They've abolished the Roads of Strategic Importance, which were actually all about road safety and the freight task, and they've cut funding for regional roads. That is why yesterday Labor premiers were furious about the future investment of the Albanese Labor government in the regions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've forced up the cost of finance to everyday Australians through their inflationary decision-making and they've actually increased taxes. Their industrial relations changes will create more complexity and uncertainty, add more cost to small businesses and farmers, make Australians pay more, do nothing to increase productivity and actually will put jobs at risk. They're only interested in rewarding their Labor union pay masters, and they're actually going to institutionalise conflict in our workplaces and hurt our economy. This is just insane. On the last sitting day before Christmas the only people that are happy with what's in their Christmas stocking from the Senate today are the ACTU, Sally McManus and all of their Labor mates.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I rise to speak to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. I know this bill has drawn a lot of attention, and there are some present here today who are actively advocating for businesses to be able to pay their workers less than the minimum wage. I might criticise this government on a lot of things—you all know that—but this bill is actually good news for workers, and that's why I'll be supporting it fully. I'd like to thank Minister Burke for constructive engagement on this bill and commitment to gaining better outcomes for workers. I was one of those crossbenchers that Senator Wong forgot to mention when she mentioned the others who worked constructively with Minister Burke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of what is put forward in this split bill today is uncontroversial and much needed to finally make workplaces safer. Nobody should ever die or suffer lifelong consequences through their work. I'm thinking of all of those who have lost loved ones due to unsafe working conditions. While these families will never get to hold their loved ones again, the criminalisation of industrial manslaughter to reduce recklessness and negligence and the improvement of work health and safety provisions might at least bring them a little bit of justice and peace in knowing that hopefully others will not have to go through the same. The measures in relation to silica safety and silica related diseases are a much-needed and overdue change so that we don't lose more people to the asbestos of the 21st century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As First Peoples of this country, we know what it means to have wages stolen. Wage theft, as the name tells you, is theft and yet has never been treated that way. People get criminalised for stealing petty things, sometimes just because they're struggling to survive. Yet employers have been getting away with undercutting and stealing employee wages for decades to maximise their profits. How is that not criminal? This is about people's livelihoods. It is time to stop dodgy businesses getting away with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The business lobby is incredibly powerful in this country, and the major parties are under way too much influence from it. An important part of countering this has been the strong union movement in this country. My family have long been a union family. Our people know oh-so well what it means to have their rights not respected. First Nations people across this country put up with discrimination and breaches of our rights in workplaces every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers of all kinds hold this place together—a shout-out to the cleaners and the working class in this place, who have to deal with the privilege of politicians every day of their lives. They provide essential services we all depend on every day. They deserve to have a safe, supportive workplace and to live decently from their hard work. We need strong unions to uphold workers' rights, the rights of all workers, because how can individuals ever counter the interests of big business? If we left it in the hands of big business, it would be a very fast race to the bottom. Unions provide a vital service to society, and I thank them all for doing this often vilified work. This bill's provision to strengthen delegate rights to ensure workers can have better access to their representatives, and delegates can have better access to workplaces, is a step in the right direction to support unions and the important work they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the family and domestic violence provisions of the bill. I know what it's like to live with that violence and try to show up to work, pushing on, pretending nothing is happening because of the fear of what consequences it could have on my jobs. Thousands of people, in particular women, go through that every day. As a society it is our duty to support people through these situations, not punish them further. I therefore welcome the stronger workplace protections against discrimination for employees who are survivors of family and domestic violence. Safer workplaces, free from discrimination and based on the respect of workers' rights, is not something that just concerns the working class; it applies to everyone, and everyone benefits—even employers. I would hope that we can all agree on this today so that we can make this a good day for workers in this country.</span>

Any suggestion in the contributions of those opposite and those at the other end of the chamber that the coalition would stand in the way of safe workplaces is just absolute rubbish and political misinformation. We were very happy to support the four components of this legislation, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023, that were extracted from the body of the bill and put through this place. At the time, we congratulated Senator David Pocock and Senator Lambie for the responsible way in which they were handling this. There were four particular provisions contained in this legislation that enabled some really simple things to occur. They addressed some things that I don't think a single person in Australia wouldn't have supported. We congratulated Senator David Pocock and Senator Lambie on that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to reiterate, those things were, first, making sure first responders didn't have to prove PTSD—because we know our first responders, day in, day out, are confronted with some of the most extraordinary traumatic situations—and to recognise that. Enabling them not to have to go through the process of proof at the first instance was something that we 100 per cent supported. In relation to silica based diseases: of course we want to make sure that Australians who are confronted with these often fatal conditions are getting the appropriate support, and to make sure there isn't a provision that allows a company that's downsizing to avoid their responsibilities in terms of their workers and adverse action against people who are suffering from domestic violence. They are clearly four quite simple but universally supported provisions that we were prepared to support, and we congratulated those senators.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we've seen now is a crossbench that is obviously up for sale. On the remaining provisions in the bill, the crossbench and the opposition agreed they were quite complex, potentially had unintended consequences that hadn't been fleshed out, as a part of the process of the bill, and required a proper and thorough inquiry to make sure that all the concerns of Australian businesses, Australian employees and the Australian community, and any of the consequences of this legislation, were able to be fleshed out before the more complex, complicated and sometimes more controversial components of the legislation were considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But clearly what's happened sometime over the last few days—who knows what the government have given to the four crossbenchers who have now changed their position in order to get their support—is that these four crossbenchers are prepared to have their votes bought. Only a matter of weeks ago they were absolutely 100 per cent indignant that the remaining parts of this bill required further scrutiny and they were not prepared to budge on it. Then, on the day before the Christmas break, they come in here and are happy to have their vote bought, and we'd love to know what that was all about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality here is that this is a government who have had a terrible few weeks because they have ignored hardworking Australians for way too long, and hardworking Australians have become quite annoyed with them. So the government is trying to create some sort of smokescreen to cover up the fact that they're not focusing on the things that matter to Australians—the really important things like the fact that they can't afford to pay their mortgages, that they're struggling to pay their power bills, that every time they turn up to the supermarket their bill is higher than it was the last time they went. This government doesn't seem to care about that. They also don't seem to care about keeping Australians safe. They completely wet the bed after the High Court brought down a specific and individual decision on NZYQ and let 140-plus very seriously offending people out into the community, and we now see that four of them have already offended since they've been out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got a government who seem to think it's okay to just smokescreen this by coming in with these IR bills. But the reality—a contribution that's been made on this side of the chamber—is that there are concerns with this bill as it currently stands today, without the appropriate scrutiny and without going through and looking at the unintended consequences that could come from some of these provisions. And you'd like to think that after a Senate inquiry the government would be prepared to listen to those concerns and maybe amend the bill to make sure these things don't happen. But no, it's just sort of, 'Happy Christmas unions, but I'm afraid everybody else in Australia has had their Christmas stolen.' Unless you're a union or a union member or part of the union or part of the Labor Party Friendship group, you've had your Christmas stolen by this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure we will see many organisations come out and highlight the faults that are contained in some of the provisions of this bill. Most particularly—having a look at my area of great passion, which is rural and regional Australia—we know that the National Farmers Federation have expressed extraordinary concern about the impact this is likely to have on farmers in our country. I will quote from the new president of the National Farmers Federation, David Jochinke:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've consistently called out this Bill for being fraught with issues that will make it harder and more expensive to create employment opportunities in farming.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where was the opportunity for Mr Jochinke and all the farmers he represents to put their case forward, to explain to the government why these changes are going to have an impact on farmers?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all for industrial relations that make our economy more productive. We're all for industrial relations reforms that make sure the safety of employees is absolutely paramount. We're all for industrial relations that make sure we have a fair operating system in this country. But what we're not for is a piece of legislation being shoved through here with no consideration whatsoever for legitimate concerns that are being raised by organisations that are here for this exact purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only the National Farmers Federation has expressed concerns but also the MCA. Today the government has declared war on millions of Australian businesses, particularly small businesses. This country runs on small business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses are where the majority of employment is created. So if you are going to add additional burden, via the insult of this legislation, to small businesses, what do you think is going to happen? Small businesses will stop employing people because they simply can't afford to. Worse still, the biggest issue that's facing Australia at the moment—outside of the national security debacle we've seen unfold through the absolute knee-jerk reaction to the decision of the High Court by those opposite—is the cost of living. Just about every single piece of legislation that the Labor Party have brought in so far has sought to push up the cost of living. I'm sorry, but Senator Watt's idea of making Christmas hams cheaper is not going to make Christmas any easier for Australians. With this kind of legislation and this kind of action we're seeing here, the complete contempt and disregard this government has for Australians is once again on show.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it very disappointing that we couldn't have industrial relations reforms that actually deliver benefits for all Australians, what we have seen today are industrial reforms that are going to benefit Labor's union mates. I want to know what you have paid to those at the other end of the chamber who stood so firm a few weeks ago. What have you paid them to buy them off so that they can come in and do a dirty deal that we know is likely to damage Australian businesses and push up the price of goods, and is not going to serve the majority of Australian workers, either?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a complete and utter insult to Australians that Labor would bring something in here and guillotine it, no less. We have probably one of the most significant and consequential pieces of legislation—700-odd pages of it that you have brought into this place. I'd like to know: what is the desperate rush? I would say that the reason for the desperate rush of bringing this through here is because they don't want this legislation to be scrutinised. If they had been happy to have this legislation scrutinised, if they were happy that there was nothing in this legislation that would cause the concerns that have been raised by organisations like ACCI and the MCA—there are a whole list of them who have already provided concerns, and many of them have provided concerns this morning. If they were concerned about that, and they weren't concerned that the concerns that have been raised by these organisations had any legitimacy then why wouldn't they let some scrutiny take place? Instead, at nine o'clock on Thursday morning, on the eve of Christmas, they bring this legislation in here and then they guillotine it. For a government that promised to come into this place and sweep clean with a new broom—we were going to have transparency, accountability and scrutiny—nothing could be further from the truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is this legislation will impact negatively on Australian businesses—big, small and everything in between. It will create a greater level of complexity for Australian businesses. It will create extraordinary complexity for businesses and make it more difficult for them to be able to afford to employ new people right in the middle of a labour-market crisis. The No. 1 thing that I am told everywhere I go in Australia at the moment is that the main crisis facing Australian businesses is access to workforce, and now Labor are going to make it harder for them to get access to workforce. Not only that; they're making it more complex and removing the flexibility and choice from Australian workers. They're telling Australian workers how they have to be employed. They're telling Australian businesses how they have to employ their workers, and refusing those workers the choice and control over the decisions about how they want to be employed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody will disagree that Australian workers need to be treated fairly, but you can't have a one-sided argument where your workers are ignored, at the exclusion of those who are members of a union. Today is the day that the Labor Party gave a Christmas present to their union paymasters. All you're doing today with this legislation is making a bad situation worse. So I would condemn the government today for this unbelievably callous decision to bring and to rush this bill through this place. At the end of the day, you destroy all flexibility in our labour market by doing this. You refuse any scrutiny so that you can actually be held to account for the concerns that have been raised. This piece of legislation will have such a major financial impact on investment decisions in this country. Guess what? International organisations have a choice about whether they invest in Australia or not. What we're seeing here is something that is going to curtail investment, push up prices and give everybody, apart from your union mates, a worse Christmas.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  The Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 is not just about helping workers but about helping good employers, the people we on this side actually represent, who are being crushed. These people are being crushed by thieves, fraudsters, the corporate racketeers and the industrial murderers—the big businesses who don't play by the rules and drove a race to the bottom on wages, conditions and safety. This bill is about standing up to those bottom feeders, like Qantas and BHP, and saying on behalf of workers and good employers alike, 'Enough is enough.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're about to find out whether all the grandstanding from those opposite about Qantas in recent months was worth anything. In my three decades representing Qantas workers, I never once saw those opposite lift a single finger to help those workers. Even as workers were being smashed by the labour hire loophole created by Alan Joyce himself, they did nothing. Even as Alan Joyce split the workforce across 38 different companies, they did nothing. There are Qantas planes right now in the air where there are four flight attendants employed by four different companies on four different rates of pay, all set up by Qantas. The cabin supervisor may be earning less than the people they're supervising because of this rort they want to protect. Those opposite knew about it. We've been telling them for years, and they never did a single thing about it. Even as Qantas workers were being illegally sacked in their thousands to be replaced by cheap, disposable labour hire, they did nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I pointed this out at a Canberra hearing on the closing loopholes bill last month, Senator McKenzie said something that actually shocked me. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I ask you to withdraw those accusations because I am not on a unity ticket with Qantas and Alan Joyce when it comes to ripping off Qantas workers through labour hire. I am not. I never have been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there you have it. We're about to find out whether Senator McKenzie will be true to those words that she uttered that day. Senator McKenzie has an opportunity right now today to make her position on Qantas ripping off workers through their labour hire very clear, as does everyone in this chamber. Either you are voting for closing the loophole or you're voting for keeping it open. It's that simple. What's it going to be? Are you on the side of thousands of Qantas workers who've had their livelihoods destroyed, or are you on the side of Alan Joyce and Richard Goyder? We'll see whether Senator McKenzie has any credibility when it comes to Qantas or whether she's more worried about her cozy seat in the Chairman's Lounge than closing Alan Joyce's loopholes. It's actually very simple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other parts of the bill that the Liberals and Nationals hate aren't even in here. They're being delayed until next year, like helping casuals get secure jobs—they hate that. Helping truck drivers earn enough money so that they don't work themselves to death—they hate that. Ensuring gig workers aren't getting butchered on our roads for $6 an hour—they hate that. Making it easier for unions to investigate wage theft—they hate that. All those things that we desperately want to get done and the Liberals and Nationals hate are successfully delayed until next year. So the part we're voting on today is the part that closes Alan Joyce's labour hire loopholes. So good news! Everyone gets to have their verdict on Alan Joyce's legacy put on the record for all eternity here today. I look forward to Senator McKenzie joining me over on this side of the chamber and voting with us, as she said she would.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who aren't familiar with how Qantas has seriously hurt thousands of people through this loophole, let me tell you through the words of their victims. Sarah de Wilt is a flight attendant employed by one of the internal labour hire firms, subsidies, created by Alan Joyce. Qantas has not directly employed a flight attendant since 2008. Instead, they are employed through a web of 17 subsidiaries. Some earn less than half of what directly employed flight attendants earn for the exact same work. Ms de Wilt didn't even learn that she wasn't a Qantas employee until five months on the job. She told the inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's quite disheartening, quite confusing, a little bit demoralising, knowing that you're there on the cart doing the same thing. When the fire alarm went off in the bathroom, you were there bringing the emergency equipment and so were they. You are cleaning up the vomit on the floor alongside somebody else. You were doing 19-hour duty and keeping your eyes open and keeping each other awake the same as everyone else, wearing the exact same uniform … I was a little bit blindsided … on my payslip there's a kangaroo and it says 'Qantas' … You can imagine what it would do for unity and morale in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You just can't imagine the result. And it isn't just the flight attendants; it's the ground handlers, including the 1,700 that the High Court ruled were illegally sacked. So how can the Liberals and Nationals defend this? What side are you on? Alan Joyce's side or that of Qantas workers and hardworking Australians?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Alan Joyce has created this loophole, it has been picked up by others, like BHP. If there is one company in Australia that can afford to pay its people fairly, you would think it's BHP, wouldn't you? It's the biggest, richest company in Australia. Just like Qantas, BHP thinks it's above the law. Just like Qantas, BHP has set up internal labour hire companies that it uses to avoid paying fairly negotiated rates in its workplace agreements. The workers of the company that BHP set up, BHP Operations Services, earn 40 per cent less for doing the exact same work at the exact same mine sites. We took the inquiry to Rockhampton, and we heard directly from BHP and BHP Operations Services workers. Brodie Allen, a mine worker at BHP Blackwater coal mine told us:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I've been coalmining and in the industry for seven years. I've been labour hire the entire time, so I go in and do the same job as everybody else, but I'm paid $40,000 less a year to do the exact same thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brodie has been ripped off $40,000 a year for seven years. BHP is the richest company in Australia. They don't need to rob their workers of their pay. But they keep running a protection racket for those racketeers on the opposite side. They do it because they can and because the Liberals and Nationals let them get away with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Senator Roberts has been talking about this issue for a long time, and I will give him a great deal of credit for that. But now we get to put our cards on the table. Now we see who really is going to vote for 'same job, same pay' in the mining industry. Senator Canavan is another advocate for the coal industry. I'm very interested in his vote on this as well. This is 'put up or shut up' time when it comes to standing up for mine workers, especially coalmine workers in Central Queensland and the Hunter. Surely, Senator Roberts and Senator Canavan can't stomach hardworking people in their communities being treated like this. Isaac council mayor, Anne Baker, couldn't have said it better. She has 28 coal mines in her region, and she said in the inquiry:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Nationals opposite, who are supposed to be representatives of regional Australia: here is a regional council with regional workers crying out for this bill. The ball is in your court. Every other employer in the country must be looking at how BHP and Qantas have used this loophole and be asking, 'Why are we playing by the rules?' when the richest employer in the country isn't and the protection racquet of those opposite, in the Liberals and National Party, has been exposed. It's just the big corporate guerillas that are doing this. That's why BHP, through the Minerals Council, have funded the whole campaign against the bill. It's not about small business; it's about the richest and most powerful people in our society doing over working families. So voting against this bill is actually a vote to let the big corporate guerillas and the billionaires play by different rules than the rest of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch on the other important things that this bill does, which, again, are completely uncontroversial, unlike your one on the ideological extremist at the Minerals Council. It makes an employer intentionally stealing wages from their employee a criminal offence. Just this morning we've seen the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association launch another class action against McDonald's over wage theft. It is endemic. Are the Liberals and Nationals going to vote against that too? We'll soon be finding out, won't we? Because this bill also introduces a new criminal offence of industrial manslaughter, and I want to commend the families of those killed at work who have campaigned tirelessly for this reform. I want to commend Kay Catanzariti, Pam Gurner-Hall and Linda Ralls and many others who have fought so hard for this. Are the Liberals and Nationals going to vote against them as well? Really?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite say they're tough on crime, but are they going to be tough on intentional industrial manslaughter? This bill makes it easier for democratically elected workplace delegates to do their jobs and to ensure they have the training they need to actually do their jobs properly. Are you going to vote against that too? Make it work better, where people can work together, be tripartite and actually work out how to make a better workplace—are you going to vote against that?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard from Emma Foreman, who has worked as a midwife for six years and has been elected by her peers to be the representative for the last three years. Emma said: 'I might be one of the four midwives who are put on a 32-bed patient ward. They are impossible ratios. I pushed forward, and I moved that we deal with those ratio issues. It was about improving our women's care and our professional standards of care and about our patients' safety. As soon as I began to raise those issues, I was public enemy No. 1.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just protections. We heard through the inquiry that delegates improve communications between employers and employees, which can deliver productivity benefits for everyone. That's how it works—cooperatively, together. That's what the bill is about. They don't want it, because they know who's in charge. When we're talking about nurses and teachers and aged-care workers having a voice in their workplace, are those opposite seriously going to vote against that? Of course, those opposite have already voted for the rest of the bill—the better support for the first responders with PTSD, the better protections for workers subject to domestic violence, expanding the functions of the asbestos agency to include silica dust and closing the small business redundancy payments loophole. We'll see if those opposite are going to backflip on their support for those as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, as you through this bill, item by item, every single provision is about making work safer or about making work fairer, and about decent employers having decent competition, not just supporting the racketeers at the top as that mob opposite is doing. We know the opposition leader, Mr Dutton, always stands for low wages and insecure work. We know that Mr Dutton stands with billionaires like his best mate, Gina Rinehart, over working people. But I also know there are senators opposite who say they feel very uncomfortable about this. We'll see if they do the right thing today, won't we?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch very briefly on some of the reforms that have been delayed until next year. It's absolutely essential that, when we return in February, we pass the rest of the bill. The bill will make a life-changing difference to labour hire workers at Qantas, BHP and across the country. It will make a massive difference to the families of those killed at work. Workers who have had their wages stolen will now have a recourse to obtain justice. But we also need gig workers and others on our roads to be protected. The Liberals and Nationals go to this Christmas without the life-saving protections that those workers would get. I say this to those opposite: don't stand in the way of the industry, the workers, the owner-drivers and all those that say that that bill has to be put through. When it comes up next year, vote for it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party is Australia's oldest continuous political party, so you'd think that it would have got the hang of government by now—but no. This week has been a shocker. Perhaps 122 years is enough. It's time to find a nice twilight home, put your feet up and listen to Alan Jones, enjoy a juicy steak, read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spectator</span> and contemplate this government's many, many failures—so many failures that the Labor heartland are turning against Labor. The polls are an indictment of the performance of this one-term Labor government. Now the ALP thinks that doing dodgy deals to get parts of its signature industrial relations policy through will quieten the heartland—a heartland that can't pay their mortgage or rent, who can't buy groceries, whose kids are taught a hidden agenda at school and who will now be stalked at every turn, using Labor government sanctioned cameras. This bill doesn't fix those things. This bill doesn't fix those basics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, from the perspective of the union bosses, this bill, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023, is about forcing people to join the union. That won't fix their declining support. The very thing that turns people off unionism these days—the thuggery and cronyism and backroom deals that only favour the union bosses—will enable more of it. We need more accountability, not less. Union bosses, and some large companies, have become accountable to no-one because they are arrogantly enshrined in a cosy monopoly of being the only union for their sector. Nothing here will claw back the reduction in real wages per capita that Australia's workers have suffered since Labor took over—a six per cent reduction in real wages in just 18 months, a reduction that just keeps getting worse with every new piece of economic data, as we saw again yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will be full of unintended consequences, as any legislation that is written out of dodgy ideology always causes. Let me review the detail of this bill. There are four measures that the Senate has already passed. Easier access to PTSD support and compensation for first responders: we voted for that. Domestic violence protections: we voted for that. Asbestos and silica safety: we voted for that. Protecting redundancy entitlements: we voted for that. These four were passed by the Senate, with One Nation's support, and they've been sitting on the books down in the House of Representatives, left by the government to gather dust because it would be too embarrassing not to pass measures the Senate passed in defiance of the government. So much for workers—the government doesn't give a damn. Instead of looking out for workers, the government is more interested in looking good.</span>

                    </a>  Now the government has brought on this bill, which contains those four uncontroversial measures and wraps into it four more issues for eight in total. The four additional issues in this package of Tony Burke, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, include the criminalisation of wage theft and industrial manslaughter. We support both of those; we agree with them. But his legislation introduced with no notice this morning includes two poison pills wrapped up in the uncontroversial. Those two poison pills are unfettered right of entry for union bosses and the deceptively named same job, same pay framework. It is deceptively named, as I'll explain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again we are seeing Labor wrap up a bundle of things everyone supports with the most-controversial proposals in industrial relations law. The right to entry allows union bosses to enter any business at any time under the pretext of safety issues. There are no criteria for what satisfies 'reasonable entry', because the assumption is that union delegates should never be prevented from entry. Union bosses will abuse this. Union bosses in some lawless large unions already are concocting safety reasons for claiming entry to businesses and then, inevitably, hanging around to apply pressure on employees to join up. If a business believes the right to entry has been abused, it has next to no recourse. The Australian Building and Construction Commission used to enforce workplace entry and union conduct in workplaces—no more. Employers can't complain to the Australian Building and Construction Commission because the Labor Party disbanded it for being a check on the unreasonable behaviour of union bosses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the real poison pill: same job, same pay. It sounds good. One Nation totally supports a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Let everyone in this chamber remember that I introduced into the Senate the first bill for same job, same pay. Let me tell you why and then explain why we knew it would cover up the real problem, which is wage theft that the Mining and Energy Union, formerly under the name Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, enables—not just sanctions, but enables and drives. I'll tell you why I support same job, same pay. A courageous miner in the Hunter Valley, Simon Turner, and some of his mates came to see me about what was going on. I thought it was a major coal company and a major international labour hire firm were colluding to screw workers. Then I found that the CFMMEU in the Hunter enables these agreements, that it drives these enterprise agreements. Not only do they not pay the award, not only do they not pay the enterprise agreement of the host company—the employer, the mine owner—they underpay the award, sanctioned by the CFMMEU in the Hunter. It is sanctioned by them, driven by them, resulting in the theft of over a billion dollars from miners. Tony Burke, the minister, knows because we have provided the details from miners on dodgy enterprise agreements that dodge the Fair Work Act. It is something we have been working on relentlessly with the miners in Central Queensland and the Hunter for 4½ years since it was first brought to my attention. Miners provided them directly to senior ministerial staff, to senior staff of his Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in personal meetings the miners had that we arranged. The provided the details in writing with documented evidence. There were details that I put in writing to the minister himself twice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The loophole is a fabrication that Labor senators echo like propaganda through this chamber. In the mining industry, that is false. There is no loophole. The core problem is that the Fair Work Act has been breached repeatedly, systemically, systematically and cold-bloodedly. The underpayment of miners in the permanent casual rort is possible only with enterprise agreements signed by the Mining and Energy Union, formerly the CFMMEU. In some cases, that union sold enterprise agreements to labour hire firms. In fact, speaking of labour hire firms, the Hunter CFMMEU started the first labour hire firm in our coal industry and pretends to oppose labour hire. It enables labour hire and rewards labour hire companies with dodgy deals, enterprise agreements and paying below the award.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former coalface miner and later a mine manager, I am absolutely appalled at what I see going on at the moment in the coal industry and in a union that used to be very proud and strong. Elements of it are now gutless and crooked. The Hunter CFMMEU approved and signed a statutory declaration as part of the Fair Work Act process for approving enterprise agreements. All of the deals were done with the signature of the CFMMEU. The Fair Work Commission oversees the process of developing an enterprise agreement. Repeatedly, it has breached the statutory process. It has broken its own law repeatedly. When we've drawn the Fair Work Commission senior management to that fact, they have done nothing. They don't give a damn about workers, whom they're supposed to be protecting. It's duplicitous. When miners draw the Fair Work Commission's senior management to that fact, the Fair Work Commission does nothing. We have told Minister Burke, and he does nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Miners have made formal complaints to the Fair Work Ombudsman, who were stumped until they were given a bevy of documents including court rulings, an Australian Taxation Office declaration, PAYE slips and PAYE group certificates. Those are legitimate documents. To those legitimate documents, they responded with a fraudulent document that a labour hire firm fabricated. The Australian Taxation Office has said that it is a fraudulent document. And then the Fair Work Ombudsman's senior managers used that fraudulent document in the Fair Work Ombudsman's office knowing it was fraudulent. We will not fall for Minister Burke's cover-up of his mates in the CFMMEU. We will continue to fight for back pay for thousands of coalminers. We will not allow this cover-up. We will not look the other way, as Senator Lambie and Senator Pocock have. We will double down and hold Minister Burke accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How was it done? Let me give you a hint. The Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, formerly the CFMEU, own 50 per cent of coalmines' insurance and workers compensation for coalminers—Coal Long-Service Leave and AUSCOAL Super. They have co-directors, who approve various contracts. For example, the Coal LSL administration was contracted out to AUSCOAL. A director was on both of those boards when the contract was signed. This is really sloppy stuff. I'm surprised with Senator Lambie, as I said. After I arranged a meeting with her and a particular miner in the Hunter Valley, she spoke with the miner and confirmed it with me. Senator Pocock was offered the same opportunity. As miners caught in the permanent-casual rort know, the solution is simple: enforce the Fair Work Act and get the more than $1 billion in back pay that miners are entitled to. Simon Turner and other miners in the Hunter initially thought that, yes, the same work, same pay bill that I introduced to this parliament was needed. Now they know, having dug deeper and seen the corruption that's gone on, all that's needed is to enforce the Fair Work Act. This bill pretends to be closing loopholes. In reality, though, every time you add a page of legislation, you just create an extra loophole for lawyers to find. The answer is less legislation, not more. The current legislation is too complex and hides protections from miners and small business and makes it easy for the industrial relations club or large union bosses, large employers and industrial groups to clobber workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Burke, stop burying the evidence. Face up to the fact that your mates in the CFMMEU are directly responsible for wage theft of more than a billion dollars, as you've been informed. The solution is not covering up the rort or fabricating an imaginary loophole. The solution is simply to enforce the Fair Work Act. That is your job as minister. We will not fall for this bill's deceit. We will continue to fight for workers to be paid their full entitlements and make up for wage theft and for workers to obtain their full lawful entitlements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I started working with miners in the Hunter 4½ years ago I put forward—and they agreed with this—three aims. The first was to get Simon Turner his lawful and moral entitlements in full. We are still chasing that. We have gone part of the way. The second was to stop this permanent casual rort across the coalmining sector. We've heard from one large employer group. They're coming to the party. The third was to bring justice to the Hunter CFMMEU, which is now the Mining and Energy Union, and the Chandler Macleod group, the perpetrators at the Mount Arthur mine. We will continue to fight for industrial relations reform. We will continue until all my three aims are achieved for the miners in the Hunter and Central Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation will always fight for workers being able to understand their rights and fighting for those rights. The first step towards doing that is making them simple enough to understand. This bill does nothing to help that, and we will be opposing it. The big gorillas in the room—to use Senator Sheldon's term—are the Mining and Energy Union in the Hunter; the CFMMEU; the Chandler Macleod group; Recruit Holdings, the largest labour hire firm in the world; the Fair Work Commission; and the Fair Work Ombudsman. Hiding mates and crooks from scrutiny will not get the Labor Party out of this. This bill will be the Labor Party government's death knell.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I don't know that we have ever faced a more distressing, country-dividing, business-destroying piece of legislation than what we are 'not' debating today—the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. There are 15 pages of amendments that we have had no opportunity to examine. There have been days of committee hearings and the report will not be tabled. This is absolutely shocking from Labor. I'm going to go through exactly why. Before I do though I want to acknowledge the Jacqui Lambie Network and Senator David Pocock for their attempt to mitigate the worst of this legislation by splitting out the non-controversial protections of workers that should rightly be in place. We've talked about the PTSD compensation, domestic violence, silica and some of the other elements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some 42 per cent of jobs in this country are generated by small business, not by the big businesses that the unions are attacking and that Labor is fixated on and obsessed by. A third of the country are employed by people who take a mortgage, who work themselves to the bone and who in bad times pay their staff before they pay themselves. I would like to see people in this place or the other place put their hand up if they've done that. I've done that. I've put my name on the directors form. I've taken personal responsibility for my workers, for their mortgage payments and for their ability to put food on the table. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a time when business has never done it more tough. Thanks to this government there's skyrocketing electricity prices, skyrocketing insurance prices and skyrocketing costs of doing business. If it's not transport, it's fuel. Everything is driving small business into the ground. What has this government done? It has brought in legislation that makes it harder for them to operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses wonder what this is about. This is about going to jail if you are late with wages. Let me explain to you what that's like. Let me explain to you what it's like in a pandemic. Let me explain to you what it's like when you have a lull in trade, which is what small business is seeing right now. Retail businesses have been smashed. Discretionary-spend businesses have been smashed. What is this government's answer? They're going to send you to jail if you cannot get wages paid on time. If you are busting your guts, paying other people ahead of yourself and your own mortgage, and jeopardising your family's future, what will this government do? They will send you to jail. They won't send rapists, people who are paedophiles or thieves to jail, but they will send you to jail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It means right of entry. It means unions turning this into a business plan to grow their membership numbers, because Australians are choosing not to be a member of a union. Australians are choosing to have a relationship with their employer. They're choosing to work in a business where they are part of it, where they offer their services and are paid fairly for it. We have a very rigorous fair work regime, with awards and protections for long service leave, annual leave and sick pay. Senator Roberts is right: we have a fair work award that works. This is a business plan for the unions—be clear. Labor don't care about you. They don't care about your wages. They care about the unions putting their hands in your pockets. More union fees and more super donations—that's what they care about, because they are barking for their union masters. The government are desperate and weak, and this desperation is shown, on this last sitting day of the year, by how they're jamming through legislation that nobody has had the opportunity to see the amendments for and the committee hasn't reported on. We know that Labor is not for business, which means it's not for you. If you have a job in a business, Labor is coming after your job with this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we expect? We can't expect much from a cabinet that has 23 members who have had, on average, 35 years work experience each, 750 years of work experience, but only four of those years in business. What would they know about how hard it is to generate a job? I hear them talking about the reduced discrepancy in female pay. It is not them doing it; it is business. It is the mining companies that are employing more women and paying more. It is small business doing that. It is not government that creates jobs. It is people who take risks and who put their homes and their lives on the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have done this. I know the stress of running a business, of trying to support workers and of trying to support my suppliers and my customers. I know what it's like to juggle these things and to look into the faces of my employees and say, 'I will get you through this and I will take the pain and I won't tell you about it.' It is not just me; there are thousands of small-business owners right across Australia who are doing that. But Labor doesn't care about that. They don't care about what it's like to run a business, particularly right now when it has never been harder. Workers are important, and businesses know that. If businesses are forced to close their doors or if business owners say they cannot go on because of this legislation and they have had enough of the layers of government regulation and stresses, where will those workers go to get a job? Labor, I assume, thinks that because there is a workforce shortage low unemployment will go on forever. But it won't. It is hard fought for. It is hard fought for to create jobs. Labor claim to be the party for the working people, but they're not. They are the party for the unions, and they don't give a damn about you. They won't give businesses the flexibility to ensure they can continue to operate. Right now, it has never been harder to employ someone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor make no secret of their disdain for the mining sector. We have the energy minister running around the world, saying that we'll stop investing in fossil fuels. Maybe he forgot to mention that to all the well-paid workers in the mining industry. What jobs are they going to go to where they will receive a 50 per cent higher salary than they do in the mining industry? It certainly won't be polishing solar panels. What is the alternative? I feel bad for the member for Hunter, Senator Chisholm and Senator Ayres because they understand the value of the mining sector for mining communities. I wonder what they are telling those workers. It is obvious that the Left, the unions, are running the show. They don't understand that mining is a cyclical business. It's a commodity business, like agriculture, with boom and bust cycles. Companies have to invest billions of dollars to get up and going. They're at the whim of global markets, and the cyclical nature means they use labour hire companies for surge capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently running a business or understanding how we compete on the world stage is of no interest to Labor. What Labor has just done is ensure that Australian workers on well-paid jobs—50 per cent higher than the average Australian salary—will be the first to go because it is so hard to get investment in this country. It is down, and it is going down like a sinking stone because of Labor policy over the last 18 months. This industrial relations policy and legislation is one more nail in that coffin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will look back on the golden years of high employment and the quality of life that we have; these years will be the golden years, because Labor is ensuring they will not last. Our children will not enjoy the same quality of life we have enjoyed. When your employer says: 'I can't go on. I'm closing my doors. I've got to reduce your hours or put you off', thank Labor. Make sure you thank Labor because they are responsible for your job going. Labor don't care about businesses, don't care about all the people who work in those businesses and certainly don't care about you.</span>

I'm the Deputy Chair of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. I'm on that committee with Senator Brockman, who's in the chamber with me. We've been going through a very exhaustive process looking at arguably the most complicated legislation that has hit the parliament this term, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. To be ramming it through in this way today, with but a minute's notice, demonstrates very clearly the disdain that this government has for this place, the Senate—and that means for you, the Australian people, because you've put us here to do a job particularly in the Senate, which is the house of review. We are not being given the opportunity to even report before considering, as I said, some of the most dramatic changes by legislation. It is an absolute disgrace!</span>

You're saying that you don't give a stuff, that you don't care, that you won't take their views into consideration. It doesn't matter because the only view that matters is the view of the trade unions; that's what you're implementing here. It is an absolute outrage! If you think I'm upset about it, guess what: you ain't seen anything yet. Wait until we finally put our report in. It's disgusting what you've done.</span>

Of course not, because it is the pattern of this government. They are reverting to form.</span>

There will be no committee stage. Sorry, Senator Colbeck. I know that means you're not going to get a chance. I know that you have a very important contribution to make on this bill, as have many others, but we are going to run out of time because, yet again, this government is gagging debate. They've never met a bill they didn't want to guillotine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will have a real impact on businesses and employees right across Australia. It will have a negative and disruptive impact. Let's just set the record straight. Those on the other side say—we heard it today from Senator Sheldon—that this somehow has to do with the casualisation of the workforce or the boom in contract workers and the boom in labour hire. The general structure of the Australian employment economy over the last generation has not changed. The percentages for casual, labour hire, full-time and part-time have not changed materially in a generation. Some people choose casual work. It suits their life. It suits their lifestyle and their priorities. Gee, wouldn't it be shocking if this parliament actually paid attention to the priorities of Australian workers and not to the priority of unions! Wouldn't it be shocking if this parliament paid attention to the choices that the employees of Australia demonstrate, in an economy with almost full employment, rather than listening to the priorities of the Australian union movement! But, surprise, surprise!—we have a Labor government in power—we are about to hit the guillotine; the guillotine is about to fall on every small business across Australia. Those opposite should be ashamed. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen here this morning is yet another Labor attempt to ram legislation through this parliament and to do so with absolutely no consideration of proper process at all. The ramming through of this legislation is a contempt of the parliament, an attack on Australian employers and a further erosion of the Australian economy. And of course it is a circumstance where the government cobbled together whatever deal they possibly could to try to cover up the disaster of the last couple of months that they've had, to try to cover up for the many other manifest failures that they are facing and suffering from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as well, there is a serious side—a very, very serious side—beyond the political tactics that the government might be playing to try to construct some type of end-of-year win, and the serious side relates to a couple of elements.  One is the big issue of scrutiny and how this place does its business. Just before half past nine this morning, senators were given the bills that we are now debating. Nobody's had the time to properly read these, yet we're about to be forced to vote on them—roughly 151 minutes of debate for 316 pages of legislation across them. Customarily, government bills come with an explanatory memorandum. Has there been an explanatory memorandum tabled for these bills? No. Of course not, because the government's been making it up on the run to get their political win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that outside of this chamber the reaction to this has been very serious, that different business groups and others, in scrambling to understand what the government has put forward, have seen problems in it and have started raising concerns with the crossbench. So let me say to crossbenchers—those who might, hopefully, be listening—who have constructed this deal with the government: the motion I'm moving will give you more time to actually have a look at those who are saying, 'You might want to consider this amendment' or 'You might want to avoid this inherent problem that exists in what the government's doing,' if you want the time to do this properly, if you want to avoid the risk of unintended consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Senator David Pocock and Senator Lambie have tried, throughout the months of debate on this, to take a more responsible approach. We have acknowledged that, and we have supported them in doing so. But there is a real risk that they have been stitched up by Minister Burke and the Albanese government. They have been stitched up in terms of the things that have been bolted on to the elements that the Labor Party have added into what Senators Lambie and Pocock previously supported. Ultimately the risks of that flow through to the way Australian businesses operate and to the Australian economy overall. That is the greatest risk of all—that these reforms are a great big Christmas present for the trade union movement. We know that their right-of-entry powers, their ability to override enterprise agreements, come into force the day this bill gets royal assent. So, they're making sure they do this for their union mates. Of course, other things, like the industrial manslaughter they talk about so seriously, doesn't come into effect until the middle of next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see the government's priorities here. They've been happy to vote against the bills that this chamber agreed to pass months ago. They've been happy to hold them hostage to getting what they want for the unions. They're happy to prioritise what they want for the unions in terms of the timing of implementation ahead of other reforms in this legislation. And they are ramming it through with next to no time for proper consideration in this chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If senators are serious about the Senate doing its job as a chamber of scrutiny of government then they should support additional time for the consideration of this bill. If senators consider that there are potential economic harms that can come from what the government is doing then they should support this motion. Ultimately, the Labor Party is running an economy at present that is being run into the ground. We can see that in the poor national accounts results. Australians are going backwards. Businesses are feeling increased pain. This legislation is only going to make that worse, hurt productivity, hurt our economy and leave Australians worse off.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) in the Government's 2023 policy paper it stated that the intent of 'Same Job, Same Pay' was 'the Government's Same Job, Same Pay measure seeks to address the limited circumstances in which host employers use labour hire to deliberately undercut the bargained wages and conditions set out in enterprise agreements made with their employees', and the bill does not do this and never has;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) without a definition, labour hire businesses (who provide workers) are treated no differently to service contractors (who deliver a specified service), this is contrary to the Government's policy intent, and instead of 'limited circumstances' it casts the net over almost any form of contractor arrangement, and this is not about 'closing a loophole';</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(f) 'labour hire' must be defined and the legislation should expressly state that service contractors are excluded from the definition and it is not sufficient to rely only on a definition of 'labour hire' to protect service contractors".</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FAWCETT:</span>
                    </a>  The Defence Capability Assurance and Oversight Bill 2023 was introduced to the Senate earlier this year and was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, eliciting witnesses from currently serving officers within Defence, from academia and from industry, who put forward their views on the current state of Defence's ability to consistently conduct the test and evaluation that is required to underpin risk assessments around the acquisition, upgrade or introduction into service of the equipment that Australian forces need. Overwhelmingly, the witnesses supported the introduction and the passage of this bill and the creation of the Defence Capability Assurance Agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those not familiar with the bill, the supplementary explanatory memorandum refreshes us on the outline:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill creates an independent statutory body responsible for assessing the complex risks associated with materiel procurement and sustainment, including but not limited to technical risks pertaining to performance and certification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is during the acquisition phase but it also spans right from the start of that phase, ensuring there are robust and accurate articulations of the requirements that a capability needs, through to the introduction into service and the integration with the force in being, so the accountable officers within Defence know they have timely and accurate information upon which to make their decisions and recommendations to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the objective of the bill, in the supplementary explanatory memorandum, is to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">a. expedite the procurement of defence capability by providing capability managers and the Australian Government a high degree of confidence in the veracity and completeness of the information they use to make timely, risk informed decisions, </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">b. provide assurance to capability managers, the Australian Government and the Parliament that weapons systems will be available for use when required and effective against extant and emerging threats, and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">i. that risk assessment throughout the capability life cycle is consistently conducted by people who have appropriate qualifications and relevant experience, </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">ii. the assessment and reporting of risk is independent, free from overt or unintended bias or influence, </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">iii. identified risk is transparent to decision makers, and  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">iv. proposed risk mitigations are effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is, where those mitigations are proposed by Defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may surprise people that this bill has had to come forward at all, because the assumption would be there that, if you looked at the rather copious amounts of defence policy in this area, those are exactly the things Defence does. I have to say: there are many people within the organisation who work diligently and who implement that policy, and many projects come to fruition to force integration successfully. But it is not consistent and there have been enough failures over time, many of which have been the subject of specific ANAO reports as well as Senate inquiries, that have highlighted that this assessment of risk—the articulation of the requirements that are required and the transparent reporting of risk to decision-makers—has not been consistent and has led to failures that affect both the mission capability of the things Australia is buying and the safety of the men and women who operate that equipment. That is not something that is acceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the ANAO did two specific reports on Defence's test and evaluation capability, in 2002 and 2015. The Senate foreign affairs, defence and trade committee made specific recommendations in 2012. Yet, in this most recent review by the Senate foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, we found that many of the failures that were extant over 20 years ago, when the Seasprite debacle occurred, still exist and impact even on very recent projects today. The overwhelming view of witnesses during that inquiry was that reform is needed, and Defence themselves agreed that reform is needed. They agreed that the principles behind this bill—of independence, of ensuring competent staff, of ensuring transparent reporting to all levels of decision-making, and of accountability to make sure that the policy which Defence already has in place is consistently applied—are worth supporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We come to the position, though, where, having established all of that, Defence still said, 'We can reform internally.' But a range of witnesses—in fact, everyone bar Defence—highlighted that the history over the last 20 years is that internal reform has been neither effective nor sustainable over time and, with posting cycles and changing priorities, we see that it has lapsed back into the same patterns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2020 Defence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">strategic updat</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">strategic review</span> of 2023, which highlighted the deteriorating strategic circumstances that Australia faces, there is a need to substantially expand both the scope and complexity of Australia's military capability in a compressed time frame. So if ever there were a time when the men and women who operate this equipment needed an answer to the question, 'Will it achieve the mission and will it be safe to operate?' and the government needed to know, 'Is there a product on the market that will meet this requirement and, if not, what are the risks of modifying an existing product or developing a new one, will it have an impact on schedule, can we achieve the capability and can we manage the costs that may come with that? ' now is the time. We need that information for the war fighter, the procurement agency, the capability managers—the chiefs of Army, Navy, Air Force and the cyber and space domains—the Australian government, the National Security Committee of Cabinet, this parliament as representatives of the Australian people and the taxpayer to have confidence that governments of either persuasion are getting appropriate and accurate advice from the department. That is why the witnesses all bar Defence said, 'Yes, we need an independent agency,' or, 'We need independence.' They support the creation of the DCAA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence had four key objections, which, during the course of the inquiry, were shown to be a misreading of the bill. One was that they were concerned that the bill didn't actually create an agency that covered the full scope of test and evaluation. But, as was pointed out, the agency specifically looks to cover the entire capability life cycle, which goes from the conception of a capability and the defining of requirements that are effective and testable, which means that whatever we buy will actually achieve the mission and do so safely, through to assessment of intended solutions, the introduction of the service and the integration with the force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their second objection was that perhaps it would cause a duplication of effort. But, as pointed out by other witnesses at the inquiry, the whole intent of this bill is to streamline efforts, to coordinate existing resources and to add new resources so that assessment of risk is timely and done by competent people, which will actually expedite procurement. There were a number of cases cited by witnesses, some in camera and some in public. One example that was publicly cited was where concerns about schedules led to Defence saying, 'We won't do the kind of test and evaluation that is being proposed.' Lo and behold, rather than being delivered on time, that project blew out some seven years and was several hundred per cent over the budget. There are many of those sorts of examples that exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third concern was that it might somehow diminish what they called the accountable officers' obligation to be able to assure service chiefs and the government around the capabilities that have been procured and offered to government as military response options. But their own policy and their own evidence to the committee identified that test and evaluation is actually the key method by which objective, unbiased, accurate risk is communicated to those same accountable officers around whether or not a mission system can achieve the objectives that are required for it and whether it will be safe. Their own policy and their own evidence indicates that an organisation which provides more timely, more accurate and more reliable assessments of risk will actually facilitate these officers conducting their roles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their fourth concern—and this is dealt with in one of the amendments covered in the supplementary explanatory memorandum—was that the proposal in the bill for the Defence Capability Assurance Agency to have a regulatory function and, to ensure continuity and depth of expertise, a technical mastery area supplied by industry created the possibility that whichever company won that contract might somehow develop a monopoly by setting standards that were inappropriate or that limited other players. This concern had also been expressed by some from the industry sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Discussion during the inquiry and the report of the inquiry highlighted that the explanatory memorandum and the bill should be amended to clarify that the Defence Capability Assurance Agency, as a Commonwealth entity, would be responsible for issuing subsequent contracts for people to deliver services, and that there would be an obligation on the Defence Capability Assurance Agency to make sure the standards set by the regulator met global best practice standards and were comparable with peer organisations, such as the Director Operational Test and Evaluation in the United States, such that they truly represented best practice and didn't advantage or disadvantage any player in the Australian market. This means that the range of companies, including a number of small and medium-sized companies in Australia who provide such services, will continue to have a role—in fact, they will have a greater role—in the provision of expert support for Defence both in training and in the planning, conduct and reporting of risk assessment activities. So in this amendment there is a new clause, subclause (4) at the end of clause 19, which highlights that there is now an obligation on the agency to ensure that the industry partner:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in maintaining, developing and regulating workforce and infrastructure standards as mentioned in subsection 11(2), does not inhibit effective competition for the defence industry sector to deliver services required by the agency in the performance of its functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation envisaged two oversight bodies to ensure accountability and transparency. One was an inspector-general of defence capability assurance, which would be, similar to the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, a way of having a group who are cleared and capable of ensuring compliance within organisations that, appropriately, operate behind classifications of information. This would make sure that Defence engages with the defence capability assurance agencies; takes appropriate note of the reports that are provided; and provides, throughout the decision chain for capability upgrades or modifications that are being introduced into service, transparent reports of the risks it's identified so that all the way through to the National Security Committee of Cabinet people are able to interrogate what has been done to address risks and so actually expedite decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other body was a parliamentary joint committee on defence. The government's response to the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade into war powers supported the committee's recommendation to establish a statutory committee on defence. This essentially replicated the role and purpose of what was envisaged by the recommendation in the DCAA bill. So the second key amendment here is the removal of part 4, which was the establishment of the committee, because the government's committee will do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the contributions of other senators to this second reading debate. Obviously, we don't have time today to bring this to the second reading vote and the committee stage, but I have distributed amendments that reflect this supplementary explanatory memorandum and I look forward in the New Year to being able to complete this debate and bring forward this change for the benefit of Australia's national security.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  On behalf of the government, I rise to speak on the Defence Capability Assurance and Oversight Bill 2023. The government is committed to ensuring that defence capability acquisition and sustainment decisions are underpinned by a robust test and evaluation enterprise. This requires sensible reforms that do not inadvertently create a self-regulating sector and that mean Defence can access competitive markets to deliver a critical defence capability. That is why the government will not be supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would create two new bodies that would add further complexity to a sector that has been asking for processes that are more efficient, not additional red tape and barriers to entry. It would duplicate functions that already exist in defence and push valuable workforce resources out of defence, thinning out test and evaluation expertise in a sector that is already struggling to increase workforce. The explanatory memorandum to the bill identifies that costs associated with establishing the Defence Capability and Assurance Agency would come out of the Defence Integrated Investment Program. Yet the bill does not articulate the significant operating and workforce costs it would involve. This is not just simply moving people across from one place to another. There are a multitude of costs and to name a few: physical infrastructure, IT systems, human resources and commercial costs. All of the above expenditures would take away funding from defence that could have been otherwise used to deliver critical defence capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is frankly surprising that Senator Fawcett and the coalition are out there saying there's no new money for defence but, with this bill, are seeking to add to the cost pressures they left behind in the Integrated Investment Program. It is indicative of their approach to defence that they have maxed out the credit card with $42 billion in underfunded announcements and an IIP overprogrammed by 30 to 40 per cent over the forward estimates, while cutting Defence by stealth to the tune of $18.5 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The requirement for the Defence Capability Assurance Agency to appoint an industry partner to deliver the regulatory function for T&amp;E is also concerning. The reality is this would likely be a large company with a significant market share. So you could inadvertently allow a large company to set the regulatory standards and practices on T&amp;E. This would disadvantage small and medium companies. You can see a world where they may be subject to standards and processes that put barriers on them. We've seen what happens when you allow commercial providers to set the standards and help regulate a sector. The propose amendments from the coalition, as identified in and from the Senate inquiry, are not enough to satisfy the legitimate concerns around creating a sector that self-regulates. Frankly, the model being proposed in this bill would not work in the Australian context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposals in this bill are not an efficient way to remediate the test and evaluation issues in defence. It is interesting that the opposition seems to now care about test and evaluation in defence. They keep claiming they are concerned about it, yet neglect to recognise they had almost a decade to fix this. So why are they now claiming a moral high ground? In fact, you only have to look at some of the public submissions to see their record on test and evaluation in defence. The OneSKY CMATS project has been used as an example of what happens when T&amp;E is not applied properly. This was a project those opposite mismanaged and neglected, and now we are fixing it through the projects of concern process. If the coalition thought creating an entirely new organisation for test and evaluation was a good idea, why did they not create one in almost a decade in government? It is because they did not support it during that time or did not think it was important enough to bring up. Why are they only now supportive?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence recognises they need to improve on test and evaluation. That's why they are delivering on the Defence Test and Evaluation Strategy—something that was actually produced while the coalition was in government in 2021. Is the coalition admitting something produced under their watch is wrong? It is important to recognise the defence achievements on test and evaluation. There is an updated test and evaluation policy, improved governance and increased training, resulting in 120 students in 2023 with the aim of doubling that in 2024. There's also been implementation of a capability risk assessment mechanism for projects, helping to identify and address test and evaluation risks early in the project cycle. You can also expect to soon see a new test-and-evaluation enterprise-governance model informed by extensive engagement with industry, like-minded countries and experts. That is why it would be premature to establish new bodies—as proposed in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is notable that only 11 submissions were received by the Senate inquiry. This is a very small number, and it would be a stretch to say that they are representative of the entire sector. Very few of them were from small and medium businesses. We need to consult with a broader range of the sector that includes these businesses before considering the proposals in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes to establish a new parliamentary joint committee on defence. We agree on the need to strengthen parliamentary oversight of Defence. That's why, on 8 August 2023, the Deputy Prime Minister announced the government had agreed to establish a new joint statutory committee on defence as part of its response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's inquiry into international armed conflict decision-making. This new joint statutory committee on defence will likely fulfil most of the functions that the committee being proposed in this bill would have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that, again, the coalition had nearly a decade in government to implement if they had wanted to. This shows we're open to sensible ideas for ways to improve transparency and oversight of test and evaluation in Defence, but this bill is not the answer. While the government does not support the bill, we are open to briefing Senator Fawcett on the ideas we are working on with Defence that will strengthen test-and-evaluation in Defence and look at ways that we can achieve the intent of the bill without creating two new agencies. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="169119" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHOEBRIDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I rise to indicate that, with amendments, the Greens support this bill, the Defence Capability Assurance and Oversight Bill 2023. What does the bill seek to do? The bill seeks to embed four key things into Defence procurement test-and-evaluation. They are—and I will read from the explanatory memorandum—firstly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Independence. The risk identification function must be independent so that assessment is made without bias or influence (intended or unintended). Independence also ensures that the assessor of risk has a voice (NB not a veto) that is heard at each decision-making level of the capability life cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Task-specific competence. Government must ensure staff with the right skills are employed to identify and manage risk. Competence is a matrix of qualifications and experience that are directly relevant to the task at hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Transparency. Previous inquiries highlight that risk assessors working within Defence face various barriers (individual or organisational) that influence whether decision-makers actually consider their assessments. Given the costs and national security implications, the taxpayer deserves to know that decisions are being made on the basis of accurate understanding of risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, fourthly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Accountability. The DCAA will be underpinned by an audited and enforceable requirement that Defence engages the Agency to evaluate risk across the capability life cycle. DCAA reports are to be specifically included in briefs provided to project managers, assurance bodies, Defence Investment Committee and the National Security Committee of Cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They seem like four pretty sensible principles to underpin Defence procurement, and they're embedded in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't pretend that this is the only answer to sorting out the enormous difficulties inside procurement in Defence, which have been demonstrated time and time again by costs overrun, delayed projects and projects that, when eventually completed, go nowhere near meeting their initial performance requirements. I'll deal with some of those later in this contribution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the sorry tale of Defence procurement over the last two or three decades at least—a chunk of that lies in the coalition's basket of responsibility and another chunk of it lies in Labor's basket of responsibility—what we've seen has been a kind of collective miasma in the parliament when it comes to Defence procurement. It has been a case of not looking, not checking and letting Defence just grind its way through, as it does. But it's not really about identifying who got us to the mess we're in. The question is: how do we get from here to somewhere where defence procurement meets what I think are some pretty core principles that should unite us? It should be transparent, it should be independent, it should be competent and it should be accountable. Maybe it should also meet the defence needs of Australia, but you can't get to the defence needs of Australia unless you go through a process that ticks all of those boxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had some pretty disturbing evidence in the course of this inquiry about what's actually going on at the moment, particularly on test and evaluation. I'll sort of summarise the broad nature of that evidence. There are elements within Defence that have clear expertise and responsibility for test and evaluation. They are staffed by people who know their stuff and, when they are called upon, they provide competent, independent advice. Many of them are understaffed and face morale pressures. They are facing structural challenges. But there are parts within the Defence establishment that have skills and competencies that you'd want to draw upon in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we heard time and time again that, when they came up with an inconvenient conclusion, Defence found three, four, five or six ways to go around their conclusion and to just drive through the project that they had already decided on. No system has integrity when the system is so opaque and so riddled with political, promotional and vested interests that, regardless of what the independent subject matter experts say, projects seem to get a life of their own and get delivered—or not delivered, as the case may be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll cite some of the evidence we got, which is actually included in the government's majority report and yet somehow didn't inform their conclusion. Dr Keith Joiner gave some pretty frank evidence about test and evaluation and the cultural problems inside Defence. He said on 14 September:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I'll give one quick example. AIR 9000, I think, was the Navy's helicopter project. We were buying, or we had selected, a helicopter that was used to ferry people out to oil rigs. So that was marinised, used and certified to oversee a city. The Police Force were flown around in it. On that basis, they said, 'We don't need to do preview testing on that helicopter.' I started at the project director level and then went to a one-star who was a Navy commodore and flight-test qualified, who was not interested in letting testers go and fly that before we signed the contract. The two-star also wasn't interested. The then head of the DMO, Warren King, was not interested. They feared that we would find something that would delay signing that contract and the funding would go to somebody else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the end we came to a compromise with Admiral Jones in a separate group. We paid the $43,000 for 10 flying hours for three staff from AMAFTU—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the Aircraft Maintenance and Flight Trials Unit—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">to go and fly that helicopter. That taught me a lot about the cultural issues. You don't always get that sort of level of serious interference, but it is about risk management. There is something wrong in the culture of Defence when people consistently want to hit milestones for fear of losing their reputation and promotion, I guess, as opposed to what we ultimately found, which was a bunch of things that the contract negotiators were able to get into the price. If you know anything about that project, it's 26 years worth of maintenance and support out of Nowra, so every little thing that you find before you go into contract and have as part of the baseline price pays huge dividends over 26 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do you have a system where taxpayers can be signed onto a contract that runs for a quarter of a century and you don't even test fly the helicopter? When your test and evaluation people say, 'Maybe we should spend 10 hours flying the helicopter before we sign onto what might be a $1.5 billion contract,' there's resistance, refusal and obfuscation. That happened because there was fear that they might have found something that said that they shouldn't go ahead with it and then their promotion would have been at risk and funding might have been at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a demonstration of the lack of independence and what's wrong with the system. I've got to tell you, that evidence is a tiny part of what the committee actually heard. We heard evidence in camera that puts that in the shade. Nobody, I would have thought, could have fairly sat through that evidence and come to the conclusion that the current pathway for ADF procurement is anything like 'on track'. The contribution we got from the government just then was, 'There are these internal processes and there's a new subcommittee established and a new joint committee established inside defence, and how dare Senator Fawcett raise this because the coalition didn't do anything for 10 years, and shame on the coalition.' And of course there should be shame on the coalition for not doing anything for 10 years. Of course things like the Hunter frigate process were signed off on by the coalition and were disastrous, but you could list another 10 things that happened under Labor's watch with equal political force. That's not really the issue here, is it? The issue is trying to come up with an independent, credible procurement process which involves independent tests and evaluation so that people serving in the Defence Force have equipment that meets the needs of our Defence Force and our national security without bankrupting taxpayers in the process. I would have thought that was something that would unite us, but no—we get pretty shallow politicking and a complete lack of answers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is extra frustrating about it is that the bill largely seeks to replicate what's happening in the United States and, to a degree, the United Kingdom. It's not like this was just created in a thought bubble of Senator Fawcett's mind. It's based on existing international practice where independent agencies—who aren't perfect—in other jurisdictions add a huge amount of transparency and accountability to their procurement. What's so special about Australia that we don't need an independent agency doing it? We get some glib line in both the majority report and in that contribution from the government saying, 'Australia's different and special'. Australia is different and special because we do it much worse—we do it at a much higher cost, with much longer delays and producing much less effective outcomes. That's what's special about Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent Australian National Audit Office report into major projects points out that there are some 21 defence projects—and this is just the major projects—where, collectively, there has been a $17.5 billion blowout in costs after the second pass approval. That's in just 21 of the major projects. It also found that defence refuse to provide the ANAO with key information to assess schedule performance. That was in circumstances when the previous report from the ANAO found that 21 projects were collectively one-third of a century late. Is that working? Is Labor happy with that? Is that good? You could just say, 'That's all the coalition's fault.' Yes, absolutely, a big chunk of that's the coalition's fault, but are you happy with that? Is that a solution you're comfortable with? Is that an outcome where Labor's happy to say, 'More of this, please'?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANAO's report into defence contract administration for the Defence Industry Security Program found that defence has not been fully effective at implementing or administering its obligations under the Defence Industry Security Program, which is designed to address risks in defence supply chains. The report also found that defence has not established fit-for-purpose arrangements to monitor compliance, and has not established effective arrangements to manage or identify noncompliance. Are we comfortable with that? In March 2021 defence reported that it had some 16,000 active contracts with a total value of $200 billion. In that context, surely it would be beneficial to have a credible and independent body that could ensure value for money and assess risk in defence procurement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have amendments to this bill which will put in human rights considerations, public interest considerations and more thorough conflict-of-interest provisions. We would hope for support for those provisions, which should be contained in defence procurement. Of course they should. But if you want to think of just one reason in the current political debate to support this bill, I give you the Hunter class frigates. It is now a $45 billion contract. It's probably gone up to $50 billion. They didn't assess risk. They didn't assess value for money. They're still trying to work out how to build the thing so it doesn't topple over in a heavy sea. It's likely to be almost unusable in any kind of modern conflict, because it's undergunned and underpowered. It's meant to be an antisubmarine warfare vessel, but it's now a bit of everything. It's like a modern-day Bradley fighting machine, brought to you by the Australian defence procurement process. The Hunter class frigate program in itself and the most recent independent review that I've spoken about before in this chamber are a case study in, 'If not this bill, then what?' So, yes, we'll support the bill. We can't bear the prospect of seeing more hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of public funds going into this big dark hole to produce the kind of appalling results we've seen to date.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  The Defence Capability Assurance and Oversight Bill 2023 is everything I came to this place for. So often we see government and bureaucracy having their own way and making very little impact on effectiveness. Senator Shoebridge, who stood up and spoke before me, made so many comments I'd like to associate myself with. He said that he would prefer to see less money spent on defence but that they can support the bill because it is right, because it puts the right procedures in place for procurement and because it's better for Australia. We talk about bureaucracies, and there is a very big bureaucracy in the Australian Defence Force, and for years and years their procurement has had difficulties—some abject failures and some successes. When we look at the three standards of cost, timeliness and effectiveness, very few of their major projects have come out with all three and succeeded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Fawcett had a look around the world and worked out the way to make this better, the way to make it more effective and the way to protect Australian taxpayers' dollars and protect our war fighters by giving them the things they need, giving them equipment they can use and giving them a way forward to do this better. We went through the four areas this touches on: independence, competence, transparency and accountability. Why would we not want that? The question isn't, 'Why would we support this bill?' It's, 'Why would we not?' I can't see a single reason that we wouldn't want to make something better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the government's point that it'll cost money—no, it won't. It will save money. Senator Fawcett, I think, and Senator Brown spoke about the OneSKY project. It was deemed that it didn't need to go through testing and evaluation because it was 90 per cent off-the-shelf technology.</span>

                    </a>  That's the point! It was a mix. That's like saying that I don't need to go and see Gordon Ramsay to learn how to cook because I'm using the same ingredients as him so I'm going to come up with the same cake, going to come up with the same meal. That is completely what we're talking about. When Defence argues, 'It's existing technology; we don't need to do it,' it's farcical to think that a different process creating those things together—we may as well say: 'We don't ever have to test anything, because everything comes from a tree or a mine or a factory. They're all raw materials, so why do we need to test anything?' What we saw was a massive blowout in time and money and a project that I think is still not out there having a crack and doing what it's meant to be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why not put in place an independent body? Let's talk about why it needs to be an independent body. When we talk about why we maintain a military, it's to protect Australia's sovereignty. A definition I've heard that really struck me is, 'Sovereignty for a nation is being able to make decisions without undue influence.' Let's talk about that in the defence sense. If the people who are helping to provide our sovereignty are also subject to that undue influence, if the people in testing and evaluation are subject to that undue influence—from within the military, from project managers, from industry—that is what we're getting to here: this group of dedicated, clever people who want to do the best thing by our war fighters, by our troops, by the taxpayer are getting worked around, with patches, as we heard before. Risks exist everywhere, and we don't get better by ignoring them or papering over them. We get better by acknowledging them and working out plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to another analogy, I was working on a maritime festival in Newcastle. We had Formula 1 boats going at 150 kays on the harbour, and the risk assessment was: 'Oh, what happens if there's a boat crash? Don't do a risk assessment there, because we probably haven't got the effective things in place. If you don't do the risk assessment, you won't have to come up with a plan.' We're doing the same thing here: if we don't do risk assessments, if we don't do this the right way, we can pretend there's not a problem. We're seeing what the consequences are: billions and billions of dollars, years spent on projects, and capabilities that aren't as advertised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Fawcett and I were having a chat the other day, and he was saying that Defence says, 'Trust us; we know what we're doing; it's like cooking a barbecue.' But Defence know nothing about the gas regulators. They know nothing about connecting the barbecue, forging the plate, connecting the valve—all these things. The war fighters say they know, but they don't know the detail of how this happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why it needs to be independent—so people can have a career doing their job properly without fear of lack of promotion, without being pressured into these things, and still keeping their standard of training. One of the things I read about in the dissenting report is the lack of ongoing training that's available for some of our people compared with the United States and compared with the United Kingdom. This would allow people to have a profession doing something they do well. It would make Defence actually address the risks, not ignore them. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy the system, but you should go in with our eyes open; have contingencies in place, have coping mechanisms in place. If the risk analysis is going to affect the budget, allocate more budget, instead of blowing out. If it's going to affect capability, work out whether it is still the system for you. And if it's going to affect time, work out whether it's going to be needed and whether it's in fact going to be valid by the time it comes through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That offset, the ability for people to just do that without pressure from the industry—let's get a project manager. Show them a project manager in Defence—once you get to a certain rank it's up or out; either you get promoted or you're out. That's what it gets to. If I'm running a project I'm not going to sit there and wait for a project of mine to go out the back door. I'm going to push for it. I'm going to run for it, because I want my career to progress. That's the pressure we all have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just in the Australian military but in all militaries. I was reading in an article that around the world in defence procurement it's become acceptable for no projects to be done on time, under budget and with capability. Almost none of them are being done, but a way to improve it is what Senator Fawcett has come up with. And he's walked the walk on this. He's worked in the military. He's seen this firsthand. He's used, flown, operated these devices that are purchased. And back in my cadet reserve days we always joked that your equipment was built by the lowest bidder, and you had to operate it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will mean the equipment will always work. It will always have a process where they have addressed the risks, where they've looked at the risks. When we talk about the Hunter frigates—again, colloquially, coming through—do they want to float or do they want to fight? At the moment it looks like they can do one or the other, and it's a real concern, for such a big project. They say that a big chunk of the blame lies with the coalition government, and that big chunk lies over there with the previous government. But all the chunks lie in Defence and their way of doing business as usual. This bill seeks to change that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And from a management perspective, away from Defence, this is just corporate good governance. You can't mark your own homework and say you're doing well when the results are bad. Having an independent body with professionals looking at contracts, making it public or popularising it around the industry so you know what's going on, leads to better outcomes. It means you've got to potentially say, 'You're no Gordon Ramsay; your cake's going to be average.' Then you've got to ask: 'Do I go to cooking school? Do I buy better ingredients? Do I hire a chef to get the outcome we want?' So, when we go through these four core principles, independence is very key: do not be able to be pressured by the defence industry, do not be able to be pressured by the defence department to tick boxes that shouldn't be ticked. Competency, increased training, a career in doing what you want—meeting the benchmark for the international testing and evaluation process, I thought, was a big thing there that we don't do currently, because, if this is a profession that is recognised worldwide to train worldwide, we can learn competencies get better and they can be rewarded across that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency—what I went back to—the clear knowledge of what this project is, what it can do and what it can't do. It won't be perfect. We won't avoid other mistakes. There won't be other unforeseen devices, but we will know there's a risk. We'll know there's a chance, and it's about minimising that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The two outcomes of all of this are one of two things. We save money in defence—we get things done on budget, we get things done quicker and we buy less things that don't work, so the taxpayers of Australia actually have more money, so that, dare I say, Senator Shoebridge, gets his wish of less money going into Defence and there's more money for other things—or Defence gets to get more things because they're more efficient. Both of which are very, very good outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started by saying this is why I come to parliament. This is a bill that has no downsides—not one. Every outcome from this is good for Australia, Australia's defence, the Australian budget and the Australian war fighters. It balances a big bureaucracy in uniform against those interests because getting it wrong has unfortunately become business as usual in so many big contracts. To say we can redefine it and—what was Labor's claim? We can diminish its capability? Is something wrong? Yes, it's wrong. Senator Fawcett has had the guts not to sit back and try to defend what's happened, in the past when we were in government or they were in government before, but to say, 'This is the way forward. Let's make things better.' That's why we're here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a quote from Senator Brown, where she's saying: 'The principles were not applied properly, and Defence was left to do it to themselves.' Yes, that's because they could. This means they can't. We aren't putting in rules that they can avoid. We aren't doing anything like this; we're actually talking about a way forward where there is accountability for these things—where we stop the BAU, where we stop the mates' rates and the conditions and the groups of people that get together and say this project has to go through. So I can't wait to vote for this. There is only upside if this is supported. The only reasons this wouldn't be supported are vested interests and pressure from the same groups that pressure the people who are doing testing and evaluation at the moment. That is, defence industry and defence headquarters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you for bringing this to the chamber. I think that Australia needs to have this happen. I think Australia's defence forces will be better for it, and we should all be looking for things like this we can do to make Australia's spending more efficient.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I applaud Senator Fawcett for introducing this bill and pushing to improve defence procurement processes, and I thank him for his service in Defence before being elected by the people of South Australia to represent them in this place. Defence is the largest procuring Commonwealth agency—tens of billions of dollars a year. As we know, Defence spending as a proportion of GDP is often used as a marker of how seriously the government is taking national security, but throwing money at a problem doesn't always fix it and we've heard too many stories in this place about faulty procurement processes leading to huge sums of taxpayer dollars being spent on faulty equipment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that it's not just money at stake here. I've had concerns about the procurement of the MRH-90 Taipan raised with me by people in Defence as an example of procurement gone wrong. Political decisions ahead of expert decisions are having grave consequences, lethal consequences. Defence personnel who are putting their bodies on the line for us should have confidence that the equipment that they are using is the best available and has been selected using transparent processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As other senators have highlighted, there's a long list of issues when it comes to defence procurement: the $2 billion worth of armoured vehicles with braking problems; the $45 billion Hunter frigate program, where ANAO was scathing of the procurement; and the $300 billion committed to nuclear submarines through a completely opaque process, with taxpayers footing the bill for a $835 million settlement paid to French company Naval Group along the way. And we do this while we're told we simply can't afford to increase the rate of welfare payments like JobSeeker to a level sufficient to lift thousands of Australian kids above the poverty line. My point is not that we need to spend less on defence; it's that we need to waste less on failed defence procurements and to spend more on genuinely building the capabilities we need. It's hard to see how more independent oversight, more rigorous risk assessments and more transparency around how decisions are made can possibly lead to worse outcomes here.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many world-leading defence capabilities are being developed in Australia. But I've been told too many stories of Aussie companies struggling to get a foot in the door with Australian government procurement, being told point blank to go and win a contract overseas to prove themselves before the Australian government will consider using their products. Cutting-edge local defence companies are selling to foreign governments but not our own because our government deems making a better Aussie industry too risky. But perhaps assuming that big multinational primes can deliver better capabilities simply because we know their names is also too risky.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on value, roughly 20 per cent of defence contracts won by Australian companies are awarded to companies based here in the Canberra region. People set up in Canberra because they want to work collaboratively with government to deliver the best possible outcomes—and government should be working collaboratively with them. One way we can do this without giving rise to corrupting conflicts of interest is through independent oversight. I'm hearing from local firms that our defence industry is in serious danger; that there is insufficient clarity about the future pipeline of work; and that where new projects are on the table Australian companies are being used for the bits and pieces, with big multinationals brought in to do all the heavy lifting and to skim the cream off the top. I've heard from Canberra based companies who have won R&amp;D contracts to help support the next generation of defence tech they are developing. When they bid for a contract to manufacture the products they've spent years researching and developing, they are overlooked in favour of a foreign company not because Australian companies are offering inferior or more expensive products but because of an inertia in the Australian procurement system that favours big, familiar suppliers. Great oversight and assurance of transparency in defence procurement can help break that inertia not by providing handouts but by spending more strategically, sensibly and transparently.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need procurement reform to give our sovereign defence industry greater certainty and to help local firms build with confidence into the future. I thank Senator Fawcett for his work on this and for bringing this bill to the Senate.</span>

I must say that it is disappointing that government members of that committee have recommended that the bill not be passed. This bill proposes a number of important reforms that should be considered in relation to Australia's future defence procurement and capability. Senator Fawcett and I both sit on that Senate committee which inquired into this bill, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, and, following the evidence heard in the committee hearings, it is the view of coalition senators that this bill be amended and passed. Like I said, this is an excellent bill, and the Senate should be agreeing to it. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  As we approach the end of the parliamentary year, we have seen this week a government willing to do dodgy backroom deals to ram legislation through this place—legislation that is not in the best interests of the Australian people. In fact, there have been so many dodgy deals done this week that I suspect some of them have slipped under the radar of the Australian people, and so I'm going to highlight one of those today: the dodgy deal around the water trigger. Let's see what the major industry association in the gas space says about the water trigger. The Australian Energy Producers CEO, Samantha McCulloch, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian government's rushed deal with the Greens to expand the water trigger creates unnecessary duplication and another barrier to unlocking new gas supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the trouble with this government. They are completely two faced on this issue. In Western Australia, the minister says, 'We love gas. Gas is good. We need new gas supplies. We need gas as part of our energy transition.' And then, over here, the Labor government does a dodgy deal with the Greens to put in more red tape and more barriers to onshore gas development to ensure that jurisdictions already under pressure with their energy systems face a higher risk of running out of gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on the one hand, in my home state of Western Australia, the minister says, 'The Labor government's in favour of gas.' But then, over here in Canberra, the dodgy deals get done. We all remember the Gillard government—33 bills guillotined in one day. I think this government is aspiring to do even better, and that's bad for the Australian public. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourteen years ago, one of my son's best mates experienced a situation where he witnessed his father stab his mother to death in the kitchen. It was an act that devastated his life and devastated the life of his younger sister, who was still in primary school at the time. Those children's lives were destroyed. They lost their loving mother, and their father was put in prison for life for her murder. Due to that, they had to leave their school because they had to go and live with elderly relatives a long way away. They couldn't maintain their relationships with their school friends, who they'd grown up with since preschool; they couldn't continue their education with the teachers they knew; and they couldn't stay connected to the community that loved them. Those lives were shattered. </span>

I was not friends with his mother, but we certainly passed each other at school pick-ups. She was always withdrawn. Should I have said something? Should I have reached out? As a society we need to question ourselves every single day and stop domestic violence in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  On 9 February, Hamid Sotounzadeh was peacefully protesting—peacefully—the brutality of the Iranian regime outside the Iranian embassy in Canberra. We all saw what followed—a violent assault by an AFP officer that left Hamid severely injured and hospitalised. Now, 10 months later, it appears that an internal police review that followed a complaint by Hamid looks set to let the police off the hook. On 3 November, Hamid was advised by the AFP, 'The investigation, to date, has not revealed criminal conduct.' How could that be? We've seen the video, and it was an obvious assault on a peaceful protester and one that caused grievous bodily harm. But, when police investigate police, too often the fix is in. We get months and months of delay followed by an almost inevitable clean bill of health for the police involved. I can tell you this: it won't end here. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 7 January next year, Bangladesh will head to the polls at a time of widespread political unrest and political repression. The main opposition party will not be running in the election because of the lack of fair rules and processes. In October this year, the Bangladeshi government put in place laws that allow the Ansar, a paramilitary auxiliary force, to enter homes to grab people and hand them to police. It's a chilling move for their political opponents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mass protests have followed which have faced police violence and serious brutality. Human Rights Watch has called what's happening to the BNP 'a violent autocratic crackdown', and Amnesty and the UN Human Rights Commission have also spoken out about what's happening. The Bangladeshi community in Australia have serious concerns about what's happening to their families and communities back in Bangladesh, and I share those concerns. With only a few short weeks to go before the election, the world needs to watch and push for the freest possible result for the people of Bangladesh.</span>

It's one of four sent by the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land to the Commonwealth parliament in 1963. It was the Yolngu people, as well, under the late Mr Yunupingu, who encouraged the parliament to pursue a Voice. And it was no joking matter. It meant a lot to a lot of people, who have since passed, in pursuit of that important goal for First Nations people and for our country. The petitions were the first documents incorporating First Nations ways of representing relationships to land that were recognised by our parliament. So much has happened in this country since the bark petitions—we've had the 1967 referendum, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, the Mabo case and the Native Title Act—but the messages and words in the bark petition are as poignant and important today as they were in 1963. Ms Yananymul Mununggurr, daughter of the sole surviving signatory of the bark petitions, Dhunggala Mununggurr, calls the fourth petition 'our lost treasure':</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">My dad always told me there were more petitions than the ones people knew about … In 1963, four Bark Petitions were sent from Yirrkala for Canberra. Sixty years later, the fourth petition is coming home to us.</span>

She tracked down the fourth and final petition to a private owner in Derby, Western Australia and facilitated its handover to descendants of the original creators in November 2022. I thank you and the people of Arnhem Land, and I certainly wish all Northern Territorians a happy and safe Christmas.</span>

But I've been making a list and checking it twice. I already know who's been naughty and nice in this chamber, I can assure you. All you've got to decide is which side you are on.

I tell you, it's been a great pleasure to work alongside them for the last 18 months up here, and I wanted to thank them greatly. Thank you, once again. Next on my list are the veterans who've had the guts to go and tell their stories to the royal commission, and I can assure you I will keep pushing for Defence and DVA to hand over those documents. Wouldn't it be really nice if DVA and Defence could actually get off Jacqui Lambie's naughty list by 2024? Like I say, there's always hope. And do you know who is really great and nice? It's all those Tasmanians who put up events and volunteer to help families who are struggling to keep their heads above water. I'm sure that Santa has something really special for you and your kids.</span>

I'd also like to thank all those Tasmanians who give me and my office advice and feedback on a regular basis on a whole heap of issues—even when I don't want it. My nicest times of the year, every time, are when I travel around Tassie, from the Unconformity festival on the wild west coast to the fabulous market in New Norfolk. Obviously, that's where I love to get my last lot of Christmas presents. A big shout out to my family and friends for their support, and of course to my sons, who also like to give me advice when it's probably not wanted. To all of the staff in here, and that includes the guys who work in here, the guys down at Aussies, the guys in 'the trough', the cleaners—all of you—I wish you and your families a really merry Christmas and a safe and happy new year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Once again, the Labor Party are showing their true colours by teaming up with green activists to put Tasmanian aquaculture jobs under threat. The decision by the Minister for the Environment and Water to act on claims by the Bob Brown Foundation, the Australia Institute and the Albanese government funded Environmental Defenders Office against salmon farming on Tasmania's west coast reminds us once again who calls the tune when Labor are in office. For Tasmanian workers, this decision brings back bad memories of the Gillard government's environment minister coming down to Tasmania and doing deals with green activists and the Labor-Greens state government to decimate Tasmania's forest industry. That deal was a devastating betrayal of workers and the forest industry and a lowlight of a dark period for Tasmania in which Labor-Greens governments, federal and state, drove Tasmania's economy into the ground and sent a wave of Tasmanians interstate looking for work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians are sick and tired of Labor governments which try to destroy Tasmanian industries like forestry, mining and aquaculture every time they decide they need to play up to the inner-city green voters in Melbourne and Sydney. Time and again, we see the Labor and Greens political parties making it harder and harder for primary industries in Tasmania and across Australia. The result is that Australia ends up being forced to import from other countries where the environmental standards are nowhere near the standards that our terrific, job-creating industries here abide by. This Labor government needs to stop being dictated to by the Greens and stand up unequivocally for Tasmanian jobs, particularly Tasmanian jobs in the aquaculture industry on the west coast of Tasmania. These people deserve much better than this government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Our planet is in trouble. For years we've had too much talk and too little action by the major parties—years of stalling from National and Liberal parties and too little from Labor. Just this week, we heard that emissions under Labor have risen 3.6 million tonnes this year, and it is greenlighting new coal and gas projects, new projects that propel us towards an unsafe planet. This year, 2023, has been the warmest year in recorded history, and many Australians can see this for what it is. Climate crisis is not a problem of the future; it is a problem of now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago, thousands of Australians took things into their own hands. They paddled out into the port of Newcastle, the world's largest coal port, in the biggest peaceful civil disobedience action in Australian history. They shut down coal exports for 32 hours, 3,000 of them—grandmothers, mothers, kids, parents. I paddled out onto the water, three generations in our little boat—my child Indi and grandchild Jordi. The oldest paddler was 97-year-old Reverend Alan Stuart, who, as he was arrested for staying on past the 30 hours of the official blockade, said, 'I think it's my duty to do what I can to stand up for what I know is right.' Sixty per cent of those arrested were women—grandmothers and mothers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to see more people take such action as the climate crisis worsens. Our world is going backwards on carbon reduction. Worldwide, carbon emissions from fossil fuels over the past year have actually increased. There is no sign of the rapid and deep decrease in emissions that we must see around the world, and until we see that, we can expect more peaceful civil disobedience by people like the determined paddlers of the 2023 Newcastle blockade. The tide is rising.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Last week I marched with local organisations Rotary, Zonta, Amnesty, DVCS, Vinnies and other frontline organisations calling for an end to violence against women and for more support for frontline services. Sixty women and children have been murdered so far this year, more than one per week. Heading into Christmas, with households already under pressure and experiencing housing stress, the rates of family and domestic violence are only expected to increase. Will the support for these organisations increase as well?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our frontline service providers are stretched to breaking point. In 2018-19 DVCS provided safe crisis accommodation to 230 clients. In 2022-23 that had almost doubled, to 414. Two years ago, they were averaging around 850 clients per month on the crisis line. For the last two months, that figure has been up around 1,100. Over at Women's Legal Centre, their funding has failed to keep pace with Canberra's strong population growth and increases to CPI. This huge pressure on the already stretched budgets of these organisations in the face of increasing demand needs to be dealt with by state and territory and federal governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the many frontline service organisations here in the ACT who work tirelessly for our community—the organisations who run food pantries, and the thousands and thousands of volunteers who are there to support their fellow Canberrans. We know that, around Christmas, it's a time to be looking out for each other even more.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  The last thing students need right now is less time in the classroom. With declining academic standards in Australian schools such a critical issue, no school should be cutting attendance and compromising the education of young Australians, but that is exactly what is happening to year 10 and 11 students in government schools in Queensland, Victoria and the ACT, as reported in today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. Term 4 has been cut by two weeks, which means students miss the equivalent of five per cent of the year's allocated instruction time. How can these bonus holidays be in the best interests of Australian teenagers? Yet the best the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, can say is 'no comment'. At Chevalier College, a Catholic college in New South Wales, senior students next year will be forced to work remotely each Monday, which is completely unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Albanese government is stuck in a vortex of reports after 18 months on the job, our schools are in freefall. The release this week of the OECD run Program for International Student Assessment, PISA, shows that, while the performance of Australian students has on average flatlined, in the longer term there is an alarming decline. We have one of the best funded school systems in the world. However, since 2000, when Australia first participated in PISA, Australian year 10 students have gone backwards in their schooling by one full year. Half of all students tested perform below expectation in maths, with 43 per cent failing to meet the grade in reading and 42 per cent in science. Of course, one in three Australian students failed the most recent NAPLAN test. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must do much more, including ensuring the National School Reform Agreement delivers meaningful reforms, including raising school standards by mandating the use of proven teaching methods. Saying 'nothing' is not good enough.</span>

Australian citizens are being pushed aside to make room for the 2.3 million visa holders this government has let in during its term. That's 2.3 million people being brought into a country that's only building 120,000 new homes a year. That's 2.3 million arrivals into a housing market that was already short 100,000 homes needed to put a roof over the heads of all those who were here when Labor took office—homeless Australians this government has turned its back on.</span>

Perhaps the next trip this failure of a prime minister should be taking is to the riverbank at West End, New Farm, South Bank, North Quay or Musgrave Park, all in Brisbane, or to the showgrounds in Gladstone or parks in Bundaberg. The footage of these Depression-era tent camps is running on the ABC as we speak. I suggest the government watch it and ask themselves what the heck they are doing. Tent cities are appearing right across Labor's urban heartland—everyday Australians unable to keep a roof over their heads because there is no roof for them.</span>

Every tent in these tent cities has a name stamped on it—the names of Prime Minister Albanese, of Treasurer Chalmers and of Immigration Minister Giles. Your heartland is hurting, and no stunts on a bill the Senate had mostly passed already will cover up your failures. Bring on the next election, because you lot are done.</span>

What critical issue is the centrepiece of the government's response? The harrowing plight of Christmas ham prices. Senator Watt, a cabinet minister no less, is calling for a freeze on the price of ham. This raises some very serious questions. Has this policy been endorsed by cabinet, or is it just a ham-fisted attempt by Senator Watt to hog the limelight? Are price controls on food actually government policy, or is Senator Watt simply free-ranging? Is he confronting the issue with the gravy it deserves—I'm sorry; the gravity it deserves? Is Senator Watt actually going to keep carrying on like a pork chop until our eyes glaze over? Will Senator Watt go the whole hog and call for price controls on other food items, or is he just hamming it up to build his social media profile?</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Scarr, but this is serious. Senator Watt refuses to endorse a rent freeze but is happy to endorse a ham freeze. This is a move that is as transparent as the finest prosciutto! We have to ask ourselves here: will Labor ever take meaningful action to help renters, or is it more likely that pigs might fly? These are the questions that Senator Watt needs to answer. Why is the government refusing to focus on renters' rights yet is seeming fully focused on bacon in supermarket profits? Labor needs to stop mincing its words and carve out some strong action on renters.</span>

It has been a happy note all day. I want to put out a special 'merry Christmas' to all of the people who work behind the scenes, which most Australians don't see. To our retail and hospitality workers: merry, merry Christmas, and have a safe one. Merry Christmas to our first responders, the ambos, the police, the nurses, the emergency departments and the firies. Let's not forget them and the volunteer firefighters as we head into what will probably be one of the worst years that we'll face—hopefully, I'm wrong—based on record. We should never forget their work while we're all celebrating Christmas. Merry Christmas to all of our public transport workers. Let's not forget the train drivers, the buses, the ferries, the rideshare, the food delivery and our taxi drivers, who do a magnificent job. We truly do owe them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, a huge, huge thank you—and you would expect this coming from me—goes out to the road transport industry as well. Thank you to our trucking families and our transport families, from the managers to the admin staff, the sales staff, the drivers, the forkies, the receiving staff, the loaders, the fridge workers and also our mechanics, tyre fitters, spray painters and auto-electricians. All these men and women work tirelessly behind the scenes to deliver at every opportunity so that we can have a very happy, merry, merry Christmas. On saying that, your efforts, although you were loved more by some during the pandemic, have never been far from my family and my family's heart, so we wish you a very safe and merry Christmas. To all the staff in this building: I extend to you wishes for a very happy and safe Christmas. Thank you for all the things you do for us. Let's drive so others survive.</span>

But we did hear some very, very lame contributions for two-minute statements from some senators there. What they really have avoided saying over there in the opposition is how antiworker they are. We had another chance today when we brought on legislation that was really important to the government and we saw those opposite once again come in and oppose legislation that was going to help working people in this country. They have form. We saw what they did in 10 years of government, where they came in and did everything they could to drive down wages and conditions. That's not what we stand for on this side. We stand for a better deal for workers. We want to see wages rise. We also want to see conditions improve. As a Queenslander, I've seen so many people exposed by labour hire. It's only a Labor government that will do it. We know the difference that we can make for working Australians. That's why we were so pleased to pass that legislation today. This is what a Labor government will do for the Australian people. I'm very proud to be a member of this Labor government today.</span>

Senator, over the last four weeks, at least 147 detainees have been released into the Australian community, including paedophiles, murderers, rapists and a contract killer. The result is that, just over the last few days, we have now seen five detainees arrested by police, including a serial sex offender being charged with alleged indecent assault of a woman in South Australia and the ringleader of a child exploitation gang being arrested for allegedly contacting minors. Why is it that, because of your failures, Australians are less safe now under this Labor government?</span>

I again remind those opposite that the decision to release was a decision of the High Court imposed upon the government. As a consequence, the government has put in place a range of measures, including those which have now been passed by the parliament, which are clearly aimed at ensuring we do all we can to keep Australians safe. And I would think that Senator Cash would understand that the government is dealing with two High Court decisions which have struck down laws which were applicable under you. Certainly in relation to the citizenship cessation, in fact, Mr Dutton has presided over not one but two unconstitutional laws.</span>

It is the case that the government has put in place four layers of protection. They include preventive detention, community safety supervision orders, electronic monitoring devices and curfews, and stringent visa conditions. We will continue to do all we can.</span>

What I would say on this issue is that the future for both Israelis and Palestinians depends on a just and enduring peace and a two-state solution. Clearly, the status quo is failing all. As I have said before in this place, we mourn every innocent life which has been lost in the conflict and we express our condolences to all families and communities affected by the violence.</span>

Civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, must be protected. More than 60 per cent of residential buildings in Gaza are reported by the United Nations to have been destroyed or damaged and nearly eight in 10 civilians have been displaced. Civilians who fled northern Gaza are now being pushed further south and, as the conflict spreads south, there are increasingly few safe places to go. The world has witnessed a harrowing number of civilian deaths, including of children. This must not continue.</span>

Let me be very clear. The Gaza border is controlled by Israeli and Egyptian authorities, who have put tight limits on who can cross. Meeting requirements for a visa does not mean an entitlement to consular assistance; nor does it mean that other authorities will automatically allow people to leave where they are. Gaza border authorities are approving lists submitted by foreign governments, approving foreign nationals and immediate family members, and we are prioritising Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members. And, as Mr Dutton knows, all people who obtain Australian visas are subject to appropriate identity, security and character checks.</span>

The pause had allowed for the release of more than 100 hostages and supported an increase in humanitarian access to affected civilians. Australia wants to see this resumed, and we support international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire—a statement I made with the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, earlier this week. We know this cannot be one-sided. Hamas must release all hostages, stop using Palestinian civilians, stop attacks on Israel and release all hostages. Australia supports President Biden's five principles for post-conflict Gaza, including no forcible displacement of Palestinians or reduction in territory and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism. I also advise the Senate that Assistant Foreign Minister Watts has been asked to travel on behalf of the government to the region to lay the groundwork for deeper ministerial engagement. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

At the last election the Australian Labor Party said in its policy platform: 'We want rural and regional Australians to receive a fair share of the prosperity they create. In return, they also deserve the same standard of education, health care and community services as their fellow Australians.' Minister, since Labor was elected you've put a handbrake on agricultural productivity, fumbled major trade treaties, introduced a new truckies tax and a new fresh food tax, and threatened the family farm with superannuation changes. Minister, is this what the Prime Minister meant when Labor promised to deliver regional Australians a fair share of the prosperity they create? And why are regional Australians less prosperous now than when you were elected?</span>

Prime agricultural land has been destroyed to make way for wind turbines, solar panels and transmission towers; our rural roads and regional communities have been stripped of funding; and our hospitals have had doctors diverted to the cities.

There was so much hyperbole from the party that posts on representing regional Australia while not delivering for regional Australia. You don't deliver for regional Australia. Did you support more bulk-billing in regional Australia? No, you didn't. Did you support more measures to get a medical workforce into regional Australia? No. You come in here, Senator McKenzie, and pretend that you are a champion for the regions, but you don't deliver the policies that actually support regional communities. No amount of hyperbole, rhetoric and walking around with a hat on makes you a representative of regional Australia.</span>

What I would say to Senator Rice is that I hear, from how she asked the question, how important this is to her. It's a serious question, and I sought in my first answer to set out the many issues which have to be considered in the context of this humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the heinous 7 October attacks.</span>

We have called for Israel to respect international humanitarian law, we have called for civilians to be protected—and civilian infrastructure—and we have called for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to be increased. We have also said that the number of civilian deaths, including of children, has been harrowing and it cannot continue. We have said we want to see the pause resumed and that Australia supports international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire, and that we recognise this cannot be one-sided.</span>

We know that Hamas has no place in the future of Gaza nor in any progress towards a two-state solution. Can I say though, in using the words carefully as I do, it does not diminish our concern for the numbers of civilian casualties that we are seeing and, as I said in my answer to the first question from Senator Grogan, we are seeing that there are increasingly fewer safe places for anyone in Gaza to go. We have continued to reiterate the importance of international law, those principles of international law which I've referred to earlier.</span>

More than 80 per cent of Gaza's population have left their homes, and humanitarian aid is not being delivered much further than the Egyptian border. Australia has given $25 million in aid to Gaza, where there's an estimated need of over a billion dollars. Will Australia deliver an end-of-year gift to the people of Gaza of increased aid and work diplomatically with Israel to ensure it can be delivered to all in Gaza?</span>

Minister, the vast majority of businesses do the right thing by their employees and ensure that they are safe at work. However, there is a small number of businesses that do the wrong thing to attempt to get an unfair competitive advantage by putting their workers' safety at risk. In those instances, workers across Australian industries look to the government of the day to ensure that they are safe at work. How is the Albanese government standing up for the safety of Australian workers?</span>

But, more importantly, we stand by workers' rights to be safe at work. That's why we have acted to improve worker safety by introducing new criminal offences of industrial manslaughter, expanding the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to include silica and are better supporting first responders with PTSD.</span>

Silica related diseases, like silicosis, are cruel and untreatable, but they are preventable. After an alarming increase in the number of workers developing silica related diseases, the government is taking the necessary action to protect Australian workers. The government is working in a cooperative and coordinated way with states and territories to work through how we act on the recommendations of Safe Work Australia. Today's legislation will now allow the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to lead a whole-of-government and industry approach to ending the dangers of silica dust diseases. We're keeping workers safe and ensuring industry has the tools to keep them safe.</span>

In an announcement on 13 April 22, then opposition leader Anthony Albanese and shadow health minister Mark Butler said their proposed Medicare urgent care clinics would be open seven days a week from at least 8 am to 10 pm if Labor were elected. I was excited to read your government's 22 November media release that on 11 September the Devonport Urgent Care Clinic will open, but its opening hours will apparently be 2 pm until 8 pm, not 8 am to 10 pm as promised. Minister, when will you correct the media release to say that the clinic will be open from 8 am to 10 pm, or is your pre-election commitment a broken promise?</span>

As I updated the chamber this week, there are a total of 48 urgent care clinics which have opened this year. There are 58 that will be open by the end of the year. Rockhampton was the last one that opened. Fifty-one providers have been announced. I'm not sure if it's that clinic, although I'll take your word for it—there are a number where we are working with the providers in the set up where there are reduced hours. But, over time, we are working to ensure that they are open that extended period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a new model of care. It hasn't been done before. In certain areas, whether it relates to workforce or presentations, there have been changes to the hours of operation based on those negotiations with the providers, but the expectation is that those clinics will have extended hours for the period 8 am until 10 pm. The idea is to cover evenings and early mornings. Because many of the providers are actually providing a service—because we partner with GP clinics or something like that—they are open from 8 am or 9 am, but then they close at 5 pm, and we've been looking to extend those hours. There are a few clinics where we are working with providers around the operational hours. It has largely been at providers' request, due to workforce issues. It's certainly not in relation to any commitment or support or funding from the government.</span>

We have seen in Ipswich, for example, that the number of urgent or semi-urgent cases has dropped significantly. It was actually 25 per cent lower in September than it was in August or July. It's a similar story at the Logan Hospital, with 10 per cent fewer presentations in September. So this is something that we are hopeful for. Obviously, there are two aspects to it: it's about taking pressure off emergency departments, but it's also about providing families and people with accessible health care that's bulk-billed out of hours.</span>

The last 18 months of the Albanese Labor government has seen the Labor Party spend $450 million on a failed referendum that unnecessarily divided Australians and was never going to achieve any practical outcomes to benefit Indigenous Australians or to close the gap. Does the Albanese government accept that all it has achieved to date is leaving Indigenous Australians more divided and further behind? Isn't it clear that Labor's priorities have been completely wrong, and will you finally give a straight answer on whether Labor is now pursuing a nationwide treaty?</span>

I would point out—you may say it was wasted—that we went to the election after having consulted with many Indigenous leaders who took a different view to the one you've outlined, and, having looked at and considered closely the Statement from the Heart and the process which led to that, we made a commitment to the people of Australia that we would hold a referendum, and we did. Obviously there was a result that we accept. We recognise that that requires a different path, and, as Ms Burney has said, that will be something this government continues to consult on—the way forward. I hope that one of the things that we did come to in that referendum campaign is, while many people did not agree with a particular constitutional proposition, that—</span>

I think the convention in this place should be, rather than repeating it—if the request is to withdraw, that request should be made, rather than people repeating the language if there is a concern.</span>

About three-quarters of Australians are worried about theft of identity, cybercrime, scams et cetera, and this is a really important way of reducing the risk by reducing the amount of personal information that's required to rent a house, to engage with government at times and to engage with the private sector as well.

A Labor Party backbencher at the time, Lewis Kent, said the card was un-Australian and should be more appropriately called the 'Hitler card' or the 'Stalin card'. Many have compared your party's digital ID to the Australia Card. Minister, how will you ensure the centralisation of ID federally will not be misused by any future governments?</span>

                  </a>  I don't think Senator Canavan understands what it actually is. It's about verifying your identity through your own control of the information that you share online to access services. Senator Babet, you are a business owner, a real estate agent. You would know, from dealing with rental properties and things, the amount of information you have to collect to verify potential tenants. This has the opportunity and the potential to significantly reduce the information that you, as a business holder, would hold in your own records about individuals that may rent properties off you. That protects you as a business owner, and it protects tenants of those rental properties. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I think many Australians are surprised to know that, until today, it was not a crime for employers to deliberately steal from the wages of their employees. Today, this parliament has closed that loophole. Of course, many underpayments are not wage theft. Most underpayments are a simple mistake, and our new laws won't catch any of this with this new criminal offence. But these reforms, passed by the parliament today, will ensure that intentional cases of wage underpayment will be a crime, as it should be, and that is all as a result of the Labor government's laws. When the Liberals, the Nationals and One Nation had a choice today, they voted to protect bosses who deliberately steal from their workers' wages. You voted against the bill. That's what it means. You voted to protect employers who deliberately steal wages from their employees—people like those working for 7-Eleven, who were paid their wages in full and were then forced by their manager to go to an ATM and withdraw cash. That's who you voted to back. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I say, today the coalition had a choice to make. They could've voted to stop labour hire workers being underpaid and they could've voted to stop bosses deliberately stealing from their workers' wages, but, to quote Senator Cash, she said, 'I will always stand with the employers of Australia,' even when they're deliberately stealing their workers' wages, even when they're underpaying their workers.

After 18 months of the Albanese Labor government, and as Australians end 2023, Australians are being forced to live with a worsening per capita recession. With historic collapses in productivity, which Labor's industrial relations laws are only going to make worse, and amongst the most entrenched inflation across advanced economies, life for Australians isn't easy under Mr Albanese, and it keeps getting harder. Why is Australia's economy struggling, so much more than so many counterparts right around the world, under this Labor government?</span>

But one of the ones I want to focus on is the fact that we are seeing wages rising at the fastest rate in a decade, including for minimum-wage workers and aged-care workers. Don't those opposite hate that? Don't they hate that? Even Senator Hume, just the other day, this week again, was telling us what she and the coalition really think—'We can't have higher wages; it might lead to higher inflation.</span>

On this side, we want cheaper child care and expanded paid parental leave, and we want more affordable housing. What do they want? To oppose more affordable housing. At the end of it all, the thing that really demonstrates their hypocrisy is that they have always been about low wages and they will always be about low wages, as they were today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start by saying that the performance by Senator Wong was quite unbecoming. It was basically just a shouting match to try and shut down the fact that the Labor government has no plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Christmas, we will see tens of thousands of Australians living out on the streets as a result of Labor's reckless government throughout the last 18 months. For the first 16 months, all they could focus on was virtue signalling with their identity politics and the Voice, and $450 million was wasted on nothing. While this was happening, they opened up the borders and allowed the floodgates to open. We saw a rise in immigration, which is now tracking to be 600,000 annually. On top of that, we've now seen the release of 143 hardened criminals, five of which have already breached their conditions. Not only have we got homelessness, high energy prices, a high cost of living and high rents, but now we've got criminals out on the streets. That echoes what's going on in my home state of Queensland, where crime is through the roof. We've got ambulance ramping through the roof. Why? Because we have Labor governments in power across the country, who do not know how to manage the economy or how to uphold law and order. It is a great concern. If anyone was going to play the Grinch this Christmas, it would have to be Prime Minister Albanese, because so many people are doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, we saw a pathetic attempt by Senator Watt to make a big statement to Coles and Woolworths. He wants to put a cap on the price of ham. Well, I can assure you that the price of ham is the least of people's problems, as they struggle to fill the tanks, as they're sitting out there waiting for an ambulance to arrive, as they're sitting there on a Saturday morning looking for a place to rent, as they log on to their NetBank accounts only to find that their credit card has been maxed out, or as they're waiting to hear back from their insurance company because their car has been broken into. Law and order is out of control. The cost of living is out of control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got our poor old farmers out there in regional Australia, who are doing it tough. Many times I've touched on how the decline of essential services is gutting regional Australia. Labor's response to that is to introduce the nature repair bill, which is basically going to pay wealthy foreigners to come in, buy Australian land and shut it down. That will only destroy more jobs in the regions, which will then flow into the cities and destroy more jobs as the Labor government destroys Australia, destroys its economy and eventually shuts everything down. The question has to be: how much longer can the people, the hard workers of Australia, sustain this type of pressure? That is the question that we will see in 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one thing that has shocked me. Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, cost of living should have always been front and centre. You would have thought that, regardless of the outcome, coming out of the referendum Labor would have had a plan to deal with the cost of living. But they haven't got a plan. Their only plan is to keep immigration high and to keep subsidising more foreign built and foreign owned renewables. That is driving up the cost of energy, that is sending businesses offshore and that is basically shutting down our agricultural sector and our mining sector. Those two sectors are what's keeping Australia afloat. The other thing we've seen in these last two sitting weeks is that we're basically now pulling 450 gigalitres out of the Murray-Darling system only for it to flow down to the Lower Lakes and evaporate. We've already got 900 gigalitres evaporating in the Lower Lakes down there.</span>

                  </a>  You should ask him what he thinks about that.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take that interjection, thanks, Senator Wong. If Senator Wong were actually a true South Australian and a true Australian, she would be arguing to build a lock above the Lower Lakes. I'll challenge you to that, Senator Wong. You keep the freshwater in a lock above the Lower Lakes, where you've got freshwater. You can use that for irrigation rather than letting it flow into the Lower Lakes, where it just evaporates. It is crazy to think that you would push all that water and just divert it from the east coast to the southern coast. Millions of dollars were spent by Ben Chifley to do this with the Snowy Hydro scheme. What's Labor doing? They're shutting down our primary resource sector.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  What an opportunity I have today after that rambling from the senator opposite. If those on the opposition benches over there really cared about the cost of living, they would not have voted against every measure of relief that this government has put forward through this chamber. Let's be clear: what's really got them riled up is that historic legislation, the closing the loopholes bill, passed the Senate today. Why? Because they do not believe in fairer workplaces. They do not believe in fair pay. They do not support workers' rights to be safe at work. They have had lots of opportunities to support Australian workers, but they haven't. This is all because of the labour-hire loophole. Wage theft will finally be made a crime, and workers will benefit from safer workplaces across this country. The reforms have been 18 months in the making.</span>

                  </a>  They interject because they don't like to be reminded. But the Australian community actually understand and know very well that it was those opposite who kept Australian wages down. They voted against aged-care workers getting a pay increase. So now, when we're making wage theft a criminal act, they want to interject. They say they stand by businesses. Well, we stand by businesses who do the right thing by Australian workers. That's what we do. Each and every Labor government will always be there to protect Australian workers. But they won't. Those opposite don't actually support Australian workers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also introduced in this legislation a new criminal offence of industrial manslaughter. This is so long overdue. I'm very proud to stand here, as a member of the Albanese Labor government, because these things could have happened in the 10 years that those opposite had the government benches, but they did nothing. They admitted that their wages policy was always to keep wages down. That's their policy. We also know about the devastation of asbestos and how devastating that has been to the Australian community, and we want to expand the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to include silica. We also want to close the loophole by which large businesses claim small business exemptions during insolvency to avoid redundancy payments. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve to not be exploited at work. Part of the Labor Party's platform—and certainly the Labor government's platform—has always been to improve pay and conditions. We also want to close the pay gap between males and females. That gap is closing and is the smallest gap we have seen in this country. Why? Because of a Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the questions in relation to rural and regional Australia, we've brought in measures to give greater access to urgent care clinics so you can see a doctor and be bulk-billed. You won't need a credit card to see your doctor. These are things that are going to help everyone, whether you live in rural and regional Australia or you live in our cities. Going back to the closing loophole reforms, the other important elements include minimum standards for digital platform gig workers, our road transport industry reforms—these are good for all Australians—and a better deal for casual workers who want to become permanent. I've spoken in here before about workers down on the north-west coast of Tasmania who've been working for the same company for 14 years on a casual rate and who can't get a permanent job and can't get a home loan from a bank because they don't have a permanent job. These are the things that this legislation does—and there is more to come, so you can take it away for Christmas. Australian workers are going to be better protected from today and from this year because of a Labor government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take the last 30 seconds of this speech to thank the workers in this parliament for the work that they do to help democracy run smoothly in this place and the other chamber, and to wish them and their families a very happy and safe Christmas, and I wish everyone a better new year. I hope that people come back here ready to debate with a bit more dignity and a bit more respect and that we have peace in the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  With this last Senate day of the year, Labor have again shown that they will do anything but provide an honest answer to questions that are asked in this place. Preparing for my contribution on the take note debate today, I did note that I had the great responsibility of being one of the speakers in the debate on the last sitting day of last calendar year. I looked back through that contribution to see what I said and whether or not it was still timely and relevant. You'll be pleased to know, Mr Deputy President, that it is. On 1 December 2022, I said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Right now, under Anthony Albanese and Labor, we have an economy with high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and skyrocketing costs of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are, 12 months down the track, and not a lot has changed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen, time and time again, government members attempting to deflect just criticism made against them, go off on rambling tangents and flat out reject answering questions. I will give them this, they are certainly consistent in that regard. If you cast your mind back to before the election and before this government was in power, they were telling everybody who would listen that they would be a government of transparency and accountability and openness. It's almost as if they went out of their way to say whatever they thought would get them across the line on election night back in May 2022, but with absolutely no intention of holding true to these promises. They made promises like fixing the cost of living and providing Australians with cheaper mortgages, which, as I said, was one of the exact same things we were talking about on this day last year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has failed to realise that when they fail to answer questions, when they go out of their way to deflect valid and just criticism, when they dither, when they stall and when they stumble they are treating this place and the Australian public with absolute contempt. This government has serious questions to answer, from economic policy to migration to matters to national security. But what did we see and hear in question time today? We saw government ministers trying to downplay the situation and its consequences and trying to pretend it isn't their problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the government's record on economic management—or, should I say, economic mismanagement. This government has failed to address the cost-of-living crisis that is currently plaguing Australians. Let's not forget, Anthony Albanese and Labor were the ones who promised Australians they would 'fix' the cost-of-living crisis. That was before the election, and now that they are in government all we've seen from this government is broken promise after broken promise after broken promise, and their promise to fix the cost-of-living crisis is just the same. It is hurting Australian families who are struggling to keep on top of the cost-of-living pressures as they try to manage their weekly household budgets, and in the lead-up to Christmas that is only getting harder. The costs of household staples, including groceries and filling the car with petrol, are only going up. For all their promises, things have only become worse under this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it wasn't long before we saw Labor trying to attribute blame to anyone and everything else. They just didn't—and still don't—want to take responsibility for their contribution to the cost-of-living crisis. They started complaining about the challenges of the economy and blaming external pressures for the spiralling cost of living. But we know that this narrative has been refuted by the Reserve Bank governor, who recently confirmed that Australia's world-leading inflation is being driven by domestic factors, not overseas—homegrown inflation. The Reserve Bank governor said, in relation to Australia's inflation rate, that the remaining inflation challenge we are dealing with is 'increasingly homegrown and demand driven'. Labor cannot continue to blame external factors for having an adverse impact on the economy, and Australians are increasingly aware that Labor is incapable of managing the economy and delivering on its promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't stop there. Rising interest rates are pushing already-strained budgets as Australians struggle with increasing mortgages. The RBA's decision to hold interest rates at 4.35 per cent this week is cold comfort for hardworking Australians with a mortgage, particularly, as I said, in the lead-up to Christmas. This government has overseen a dozen interest rate rises—and that is one thing that has actually changed since this time last year, when I last spoke on this debate—which means the average mortgage holder is paying $24,000 a year more in interest repayments. As we approach Christmas, families will be paying even closer attention to their household budgets. It should be a time for celebration and happiness, but unfortunately so many hardworking Australian families will be forced to make tough financial decisions through no fault of their own, because of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the remaining time I have left, given that this is the last day of the Senate for the year: have a merry Christmas, everybody, and a happy new year.</span>

                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  Well, I delight in taking note of the answers to questions asked by senators opposite today, because every question has given our government an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to staying focused on what matters to Australians. We know that cost of living is at the top of people's agenda. But what have we got from those opposite? We had from the Leader of the Opposition a leadership that saw votes against cost-of-living relief, opposition to reform of wages and conditions and opposition to wage rises, in effect, after keeping wages low for a decade purposefully. You can do as much shouting from your position opposite as you like, but that obstruction and aggression does nothing to assist our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have delivered targeted relief while not adding to inflation. And it's quite remarkable, really, when you hear the incoherence of those opposite when it comes to any alternative economic agenda. They opposed electricity bill relief, which we have seen roll out right around the country, including in my own home state of WA. Gallingly, they opposed making medicines cheaper. We have also made it easier and cheaper to see a doctor. We've introduced cheaper child care, expansions of paid parental leave, more social and affordable housing, increases in rent assistance, and fee-free TAFE. We now have wages rising at the fastest rate for a decade, including for minimum-wage and aged-care workers. When we get questions from those opposite trying to spin their position for the day, nothing can take away from our commitment and strength in focusing, every day and every week, on what matters to Australians. This means delivering on our commitments which are delivering benefits to Australians who are clearly under the pump at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But those opposite have nothing positive to offer our nation. They vote against cost-of-living relief when we know Australians are doing it tough. Again, we've seen today, through the opposition's opposition to our industrial law reform package, the embedded and entrenched position and commitment that they have to keeping wages down in our nation. Under their leadership, we saw wages low for a decade, and now we see a purposeful attempt from those opposite to continue to try and divide our nation, when what we really need is to be able to come together. Shouting is no solution for these times. Aggression and obstruction don't help our nation; they hurt it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I note the answers today, Senator Wong was also asked about our agenda for rural and regional Australia. As a government we have invested $3 billion in the agricultural portfolio and a billion dollars more for biosecurity. For the first time, sustainable biosecurity funding is now in place. That is something that those opposite could never deliver. We in this government have opened Medicare urgent care clinics right around the country, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and there are many such clinics up and running in my own home state of WA. I had the great pleasure of opening one such clinic in Western Australia just a few weeks ago.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I listened with great interest to the answer to the first question today from Senator Cash on the unnecessary release of 147 dangerous detainees from immigration detention. I think the Attorney-General's conduct at the press conference yesterday should alarm all Australians and absolutely put into question his fitness for the job as our first law officer. Peta Credlin last night criticised the Attorney-General for trying to use a 'big man's tactic' of 'intellectual intimidation' against a very fine Sky News reporter Olivia Caisley. I actually disagree with Peta Credlin. He is using a big man's tactic and intellectual intimidation, and, as Sussan Ley and others have said, it's also probably one of the worst cases of mansplaining. But I think it is so much worse than that and goes against the code of conduct of this place, and it is a very, very clear case of bullying. Let me tell you why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, let's have a look at what he actually said. Speaking to the media yesterday, he was asked by Sky News political reporter Olivia Caisley whether he; the Minister for Home Affairs, Clare O'Neil; or the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Giles, would apologise to the Australian people for releasing criminals. Of course he should have apologised to the Australian people. Of course all three of them should have apologised to the Australian people. But instead of saying, 'Yes, we got it wrong,' and respecting the journalist, he pointed his finger at Ms Caisley and called the question 'absurd'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You are asking a cabinet minister, three ministers of the Crown, to apologise for upholding the law of Australia, for acting in accordance with the law of Australia, for following the instructions of the High Court of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How dare an Australian journalist ask this question. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I will not be apologising for upholding the law. I will not be apologising for pursuing the rule of law and I will not be apologising for acting …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he pointed, and he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Do not interrupt … I will not be apologising for acting in accordance with a High Court decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, he wasn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go to the code of conduct of this place. It contains five principles. Principle No. 1 says, 'Act respectfully, professionally and with integrity.' He didn't. He breached the first. The second principle is: 'Encourage and value diverse perspectives and recognise the importance of a free exchange of ideas.' Clearly, he breached the second principle. The third is: 'Recognise your power, influence or authority and do not abuse them. Clearly, as the first law officer of this nation, he has contravened the third principle as well. The fourth is: 'Uphold laws that support safe and respectful workplaces, including anti-discrimination, employment, work health and safety and criminal laws. Clearly, he has breached the fourth guideline. It was not a safe or respectful workplace for the journalist in that place. The fifth principle is: 'Bullying, harassment, sexual harassment or assault, or discrimination in any form, including on the grounds of race, age, sex, sexuality, gender identity, disability, or religion will not be tolerated, condoned or ignored.' Guess what. The first law officer of this nation, the Attorney-General, has managed a hat-trick of five. He has managed, in my opinion and, I'm sure, in the opinion of every average Australian, to break all five of the principles of our code of conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is it a breach of the code of conduct of this place, the behaviour he demonstrated yesterday would not be acceptable in any other workplace in this country—not one—except this place. How can it be that a lot of our journalists have chosen not to report about this? As Peter Dutton observed yesterday, if this was anybody on our side of politics, they would have been drummed out of the parliament already, but there has been not a word. Bullying comes not only in such an overt fashion but in many other fashions. I've run out of time to go through all of those at this time, but those of that office should hang their heads in shame.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The absolutely catastrophic situation in Gaza was described overnight by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, in very clear terms. Mr Guterres wrote to the UN Security Council, invoking for the first time in his term article 99 of the UN Charter, which allows him to bring to the attention of the Security Council any event that threatens the security of the world. In his letter, he said he expects public order to completely break down soon due to desperate conditions in Gaza as the territory comes under constant bombardment by the Israeli Defense Forces. He wrote that the humanitarian system in Gaza is facing a severe risk of collapse. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Amid constant bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces, and without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aid organisations say that nowhere in Gaza is safe anymore, there's only a trickle of humanitarian aid getting through and hardly any getting past the Egyptian border.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the minister: given this catastrophe, would we join the calls of the UN for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and increase our aid? Minister Wong's response made me both sad and furious. Our government is so joined at the hip in such a craven alliance with the Israeli state and US imperialism in the Middle East that, despite their war crimes, all we're willing to do is 'support international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire and, if there's a need for more aid, then we would consider it'. We have given $21 million when the estimated need is $1 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our government. They represent us on the world stage. Through our government's actions and inactions we are complicit in the war crimes being committed by Israel, both in our unwillingness to call out these crimes and, as Senator Shoebridge made clear in his questioning earlier this week, the sale of over $30 million in arms and ammunition to Israel over the last 15 years, on DFAT's own figures. Not in my name. Not in our name. Not in the name of hundreds of thousands of Australians taking to the streets every week while this war is ongoing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why won't we join the UN and call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire? The answer Minister Wong gave me was because Hamas is holding hostages. I and the Greens condemn the attacks of Hamas on 7 October and the killing of 1,200 Israelis and call for the release of the hostages, but the UN and all the leading aid organisations who are calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire know too that Hamas is holding hostages and they are calling for their release too. There is no doubt that an immediate and permanent ceasefire would have to involve Hamas and the release of the hostages. It is totally spurious to say that the hostages held by Hamas are the blockage to calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Wong said that we support a just and lasting peace. If there is one thing that is certain, it's that we're further away from a just and lasting peace for Israel and Palestine every day this war continues. Every day we see the ongoing destruction of Gaza and every day we see the killing of women, children and the elderly is a day we are closer to the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, closer to genocide in Gaza. Every day we are further from that peace. So I implore our government to join the Greens and the international community in the call for an immediate and permanent humanitarian ceasefire. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all Australians, as we enter the festive season, to keep letting our government know that the government's position is not their position, to remember the people of Gaza and to do everything they can to work for peace. I've had Handala around my neck as a talisman since 7 October. For the people of Gaza I say, 'Sumud.' I send you my love, prayers, determination and hope for a better future.</span>

                    </a>  The government will not be supporting this motion. The shadow minister for education accuses the government of being 'caught up in a vortex of education reviews' and now proposes one. We have done the reviews, we have the evidence and we know that under those opposite school attendance dropped, school completion rates dropped, and the gap between students from disadvantaged backgrounds and those who aren't got worse. Together with the states and territories we established a panel of experts to inform the next national school reform agreement. Next year we will negotiate that agreement and get on with the job of building a better and fairer education system for the country.</span>

My understanding is that convention has been that where an amendment is moved a senator is granted leave to make a short, one-minute statement in relation to the amendment. So I'd encourage the government to reconsider that.</span>

So you can suspend, but then we immediately put the suspension question. I understand there is no leave given to make a one-minute statement. Senator McGrath, you've moved a suspension.

                    </a>  Unless it's amended, I will not be supporting this motion. Senator Green has decided to finish the year with a motion about extremism, notably only right-wing. Does her omission of the opera house Hamas rally that called for Jews to be gassed mean the senator is endorsing that call? Does her omission of environmental extremism that terrorised a female executive in her home mean the senator is endorsing that? Apparently so. </span>

One Nation denounces communist Soviet Russia and the Stalin regime that killed an estimated 40 million people. We denounce communist China's Chairman Mao, who killed 60 million people. We denounce Maurice Strong, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, whose unscientific ban on DDT caused the unnecessary deaths of 60 million people from malaria between 1976 and 2006. In this place terrorism and extremism should be dealt with in a bipartisan way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that the opposition was denied the opportunity to make this statement in relation to the very important issue of violent extremism. We asked for one minute, and it was denied by elements of this chamber. The statement reads: 'In 2021 ASIO amended its umbrella terms to describe violent extremism to reflect emerging and evolving threats. ASIO does not investigate people solely because of their political views, so labels like Left and Right often distract from the real nature of the threat. They also no longer adequately describe the phenomenon that we are seeing. According to ASIO, it is equally critical to understand that every ideologically motivated extremist is not automatically a left-wing or a right-wing extremist. There is a cohort of individuals motivated by a toxic cocktail of conspiracies, grievances and anti-authority beliefs. It is neither helpful nor accurate to reflexively assign these individuals to a place on the political spectrum. As such, having a sole focus on right-wing extremists forgoes considerations of the broader reality that violent extremism in general is the true threat to our society, specifically the horrific antisemitism that we have seen in recent weeks.' </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate records its sorrow at the death, on 15 November 2023, of the Honourable Gerard (Gerry) Leslie Hand, former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs, and former member for Melbourne, places on record its gratitude for his service to the Parliament and the nation and tenders its sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise on behalf of the government to express our condolences following the passing of a great servant of our nation, of the parliament and of the Australian Labor Party the Hon. Gerard Leslie Hand, better known as Gerry, at the age of 81. As I begin, I wish to convey the government's sympathies to Gerry's family, especially his widow, Faith, and children, Michelle, Vicky, Leigh and Lorcan, as well as to his former colleagues and many friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gerry Hand represented a new generation of the Left in the Labor Party. He was, in the words of his successor as the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, 'a unique amalgam of passion and pragmatism'. He played a crucial role in the return of the Labor Left from the fringes of influence inside the party and the labour movement to the very centre of decision-making. Ultimately, Gerry Hand's politics prioritised, above all else, improving the lives of the poorest, most disadvantaged in our society. For him, that was the responsibility of government and the Labor Party's core reason for being. A politician of conviction, he advocated passionately for the overwhelmingly working-class and migrant communities he represented in the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gerry elevated the status of Indigenous issues within both the Labor government and the country's political dialogue. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, he introduced the legislation to enable the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC. He remained stoic in the face of sometimes-harsh criticism that came from implementing tough immigration policies, and he championed Australian multiculturalism as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs from 1990 to 1993.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gerry Hand was born and raised in Warrnambool, in south-west Victoria, the eldest of seven children. The son of shopkeepers, Gerry worked first in his family's tobacconist shop before taking up full-time work in the Warrnambool woollen mills. It was there, on the shopfloor, that he developed his political consciousness, as so many have done before and so many have done since. He went on to establish the South-West District Trades and Labour Council in 1972. He served as the council's first secretary and drove its growth in size and influence throughout the Whitlam years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1979 Gerry Hand sought preselection for the federal seat of Wills, in Melbourne's inner north—a safe Labor seat. Hand was a strong candidate put forward by the party's Socialist Left faction. Hand sought to move from organising within the labour movement and the ALP, as he had done remarkably successfully throughout the 1970s, to making a broader contribution in Canberra. Unfortunately for Gerry Hand, though, another trade unionist had set his sight on Wills, and Gerry lost preselection in 1979 to none other than Bob Hawke. It was an at-times-bitter contest between the two men, one which encapsulated many of the roiling ideological and personality conflicts of that era of Labor politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gerry Hand did not have to wait long to enter the parliament, though. He gained preselection for the seat of Melbourne at the 1983 election—a community he would represent for a decade. He described his inner-city electorate as a rich melting pot of modern Australia, from a substantial Greek population in Richmond, an Italian influence in Carlton and a mixture of nationalities in Brunswick to poverty-stricken communities who occupied high-rise estates in Richmond, Fitzroy, Collingwood, North Melbourne and Kensington, and more affluent groups moving into the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was most striking about Gerry Hand in his early parliamentary contributions was his strident progressivism. A self-proclaimed democratic socialist, he was unabashed in his calls for a dramatic redistribution of resources to create a fairer society. He championed the Hawke government's commitment to eliminate poverty and gross inequality, and he saw delivering on this commitment as the responsibility of government—a responsibility that he believed should be met through generous social services, from child care and unemployment benefits to support for the sick, widowed and those with disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gerry Hand was elevated to the position of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Hawke government, serving from 1987 to 1990. His vision of Aboriginal affairs prioritised self-determination for our country's First Peoples. He was the minister with carriage of ATSIC, an initiative designed to ensure the place of the Indigenous peoples of this country in the decision-making processes of government. Indeed, it was remarked of Gerry Hand that, in his role as Aboriginal affairs minister, he prioritised listening to, rather than lecturing at, Indigenous communities. This is, of course, the approach the Albanese government has pursued both in advocating for constitutional recognition through a voice to parliament and in determining the path forward, since that referendum did not succeed. As we well know, the vital work of reconciliation continues so, in Gerry Hand's words, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians can 'take their rightful place as full and equal participants in the richness and diversity of this nation'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Immigration from 1990 to 1993, Gerry Hand didn't shy away from difficult decisions. He advanced tough policies on immigration detention while stressing the importance of compassion for refugees and those seeking asylum. As the Minister for Ethnic Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs, he promoted Australian multiculturalism, bringing his famous enthusiasm for people to his engagement with multicultural communities. Some politicians may have shied away from portfolios as challenging as Aboriginal Affairs, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. For Gerry Hand, these were the only portfolios he wanted, because, in his words, they were 'people portfolios'. To him, they were areas where politics and politicians could make a real, tangible difference to improve people's lives. In these roles, Hand engaged extensively with and advocated for the most disadvantaged in our community. He lived his commitment to challenge injustice and to fight the national shame of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A journalist profiling Gerry Hand in 1985 wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nobody who has spent more than a few minutes with Hand doubts the sincerity of what he is up to—working through the party to improve the lot of the poor and disadvantaged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sincere, committed and passionate—may Gerry Hand long be remembered this way. On behalf of the government, I would like to again express our condolences following the passing of the Hon. Gerry Hand, and we once more convey our sympathies to Faith, Michelle, Vicky, Leigh and Lorcan; his wider family; and all those beyond who knew him well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I rise to support the motion of the government in paying tribute to the life of the Hon. Gerard Leslie Hand and to associate the opposition with the remarks made by Senator Watt. Best known as Gerry, he was a product of working-class Australia, a proud member of the Labor left and a politician passionately driven to better people's lives. Gerry Hand, born on 30 June 1942, was the eldest of seven children to Les and Sheila Hand. Growing up in the south-west of Victoria in the Warrnambool area, as a young man, Gerry worked in the family tobacconist and as a driver, a milkman, a grass cutter and in a fish-and-chip shop. Then for eight years he was a textile worker and a shop steward with the Warrnambool woollen mill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gerry was a worker and a worker's man with a go-get-em attitude and, as it turned out, a natural talent for organising. In 1972, he established the South West Trades and Labour Council and later became secretary of the Warrnambool branch of the ALP and a researcher for Senator Cyril Primmer—all of which drove him to pursuing his own path in politics. After moving to Melbourne, Gerry used his experience as a springboard into his first battle for preselection in Wills. As Senator Watt has said, Gerry was somewhat up against it in that preselection battle. He was up against, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> put it at the time, 'the most popular political personality in the country'—namely, Bob Hawke. It was right faction against left faction, and, actually quite remarkably, Hawke only defeated Hand by a relatively small margin. But it would only be two short years before Gerry Hand was preselected in the neighbouring seat of Melbourne, winning the seat in 1983 and holding it for almost 10 years until his retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what made Gerry Hand tick, because he was a straight talker. He never shied away from espousing his left-wing political beliefs or asserting his principles. He took pride in being branded a socialist, and he openly acknowledged his very strong views about the redistribution of wealth. In his maiden speech to the House of Representatives, Gerry spoke with compassion about the working-class families and migrants who helped shape Australia, the suburbs, and the need to improve the quality of inner urban life. On show was a man who cared deeply about widowed women, the elderly, the unemployed, the homeless and those from various ethnic or Indigenous backgrounds. Gerry felt a calling to improve services for those Australians who needed the most, whom he saw in his words as having been thrown onto the economic scrap heap. An article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span> of June 1985 said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nobody who has spent more than a few minutes with Hand doubts the sincerity of what he is up to—working through the party to improve the lot of the poor and disadvantaged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, the preselection rivalry between Hawke and Hand was set aside and, despite their differences, they grew very close. Gerry served in the Hawke and Keating governments dutifully, especially as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and as the minister for immigration. He felt passionately about those portfolios and particularly about improving Indigenous lives. Angered by the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody and frustrated by the ineffectiveness of federal programs and funding, Gerry pushed forward with different reforms, including the 1989 establishment by the Hawke government of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his hometown and electorate, Gerry saw firsthand the positive impacts of Australia's managed migration program. It was for that reason that Gerry Hand, though very committed to immigration but also was clear in his sense of justice, adopted a hard stance against illegal migration, which he said 'blows to pieces a fair system'. Gerry oversaw new measures to deter, detect and deport illegal migrants, and he implemented Australia's system of mandatory detention, which remains integral to managing migration to this day. It's a sign that, despite all of his beliefs, there was a strong commitment there to systems operating with fairness and to recognising that sometimes governments need to do hard things to ensure those systems operate with that appropriate fairness and effectiveness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's right to say that for the portfolios that Gerry held he left an indelible mark, as did his commitment to his electorate. His eventual predecessor, Lindsay Tanner, would recall instances of Gerry leaving a significant factional meeting to go and help a local pensioner. It was this desire to help that was biggest in Gerry Hand's approach. In his valedictory address, Gerry said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is a great privilege to come here and to try to help people. You only get one shot at it. I have had my shot. I am very proud to have been here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those words, Gerry Hand expressed a sentiment felt by virtually all, I'm sure, who serve anywhere in this parliament, regardless of time, regardless of politics. And, with Gerry Hand, it is very clear that he lived up to that ambition, taking his shot and working to help people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the opposition, we thank Gerry Hand for his service and contribution to Australia and offer our deep condolences and sincere thanks to Gerry's family, friends and loved ones, and his Labor colleagues.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on the rental sector, together with accompanying documents, and I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Chair of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, I'm pleased to present the report of the inquiry into the worsening rental crisis in Australia. It's the first ever national inquiry into renting. This inquiry presented a unique opportunity for renters to directly share their experiences with parliament. The inquiry received 407 written submissions, a whopping 16,061 submissions through a simplified submission form, with over 9,000 of these being from renters, and evidence from witnesses across four hearings in Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. Clearly, the rental and housing crisis is having a huge impact on Australians, and people are desperate for their stories to be heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly proud that we established this inquiry. Particularly, I would like to thank the Australian Greens spokesperson for housing and homelessness, Max Chandler-Mather, and his team. Without their staunch advocacy and the work of other advocates, renters would never have been such a key political issue, and a national rental inquiry would never have been a priority. I would also like to thank the community affairs secretariat for the countless hours of work they put into analysing the thousands of submissions and for the research and preparation they did for each hearing and this report. Without their work, we would not have been able to undertake such a landmark inquiry. Most of all, I want to thank all those who made submissions, provided evidence and shared the traumatic experience of being a renter. I also want to thank those who have been advocating and continue to advocate for meaningful reforms to improve renters' rights and security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again and again throughout this inquiry, the committee heard evidence of the dire state of Australia's housing system. We heard how right now there are 640,000 households under severe rental stress, how years of chronic underfunding and privatisation of public housing by governments have led to a shortfall of genuinely affordable housing of approximately 750,000 homes and how this has pushed many renters into the private rental market and led to a system of exponential rent increases, stress and insecurity. What was made undeniably clear by an overwhelming amount of submitters and witnesses is that we are in the midst of a housing crisis, one of the worst that Australia has ever seen. We heard how renters across the country are struggling with the same four issues: the lack of genuinely affordable housing, including public, social and community housing; unregulated and skyrocketing rents; inadequate tenant protections; and systems that fundamentally favour landlords.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Renters across the country are having to live in inadequate and unsafe conditions due to the fundamental power imbalance between landlords and tenants. One witness and renter, Leanne, told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There's inequality and unfairness in our current rental system, and it favours our landlords. The system is failing us. Asking for the leaky gas stove to be repaired or for the hole in the back deck to be repaired so we don't step through it in the dark is a risk. Asking not to have to set rat traps under your bed at night so that you can sleep is not good enough. But it's okay because the rent's cheap. Every conversation with my landlord is a mental calculation about how much this is going to cost me. I've just waited two weeks for a new washing machine. There are eight people in our flats using one washing machine. I looked on Google, and $600 is all that costs, but that's a mental calculation in my mind: where's the next rent increase coming from? The list goes on with the repairs, and I wish that the rat trap under the bed was a joke. But it's not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many witnesses also expressed how unrelenting and devastating rental increases can be to a person's finances and wellbeing. We heard how unregulated rent hikes have driven a family to move into a caravan and how a single mother working in the Public Service was forced to live in a share house with her newborn baby.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the many distressing testimonies about the urgency and severity of the housing crisis, as chair of the committee I have put forward a suite of important recommendations to the government in my additional comments. The first and foremost of my chair's recommendations is for the government to commit to substantial further investment in public and community housing in the next federal budget, including specific funding for youth and First Nations housing. While the recently legislated HAFF was a step in the right direction, particularly the extra $3 billion that the Greens negotiated for affordable housing, evidence from this inquiry revealed that this investment falls completely short. It's estimated that the unmet national demand for social housing will be around 550,000 dwellings by 2037, revealing the total inadequacy of the HAFF's promise of 30,000 homes over the next five years. If we want to reduce public and community housing waitlists, have an impact on the extremely low vacancy rates in the private rental market and fix this housing crisis, we must reverse the years of neglect and chronic underfunding of our public and affordable housing system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My chair's recommendations also include providing immediate relief to renters and strengthening renters' rights. Crucially, these include that the government work with the states and territories: to freeze rental increases for two years, followed by a limit on rental increases of two per cent every two years; to amend tenancy laws and strengthen the prohibition on rent bidding; to remove no-grounds evictions; to legislate a minimum set of standards for energy efficiency; and to raise the rate of income support payments and review Commonwealth Rent Assistance. We are in the midst of a crisis, and this demands crisis-level attention. Evidence was provided by many witnesses suggesting a rent freeze as a sensible and effective solution to the escalating rental crisis. Rents have gone up 33 per cent over the last three years. It's going to take a long time for wages and particularly income support payments to catch up with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Skyrocketing rents are dire for people on Centrelink payments. According to Anglicare's 2023 <span style="font-style:italic;">Rental </span><span style="font-style:italic;">affordability snapshot</span>, zero per cent of rentals are affordable to a person on JobSeeker and Youth Allowance and 0.1 per cent are affordable to a person on the DSP. Many witnesses told the committee that the current rates of rental assistance are not enough, and we heard how CRA is poorly targeted and often fails to support people who need the most support. Recent changes to CRA and income support simply tinker around the edges of a system that fails to support people on the lowest incomes to find shelter. To truly help people have a secure roof over their head, income support payments must be urgently raised. As the Antipoverty Centre noted, doing so will support the largest number of people experiencing both housing and financial stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry also investigated and made clear recommendations on other issues impacting the current housing crisis, like regulating short-term rentals, reforming our tax system, reviewing planning laws and expanding the application of the Privacy Act to all real estate agencies and the RentTech business. These recommendations build upon the work of advocates, organisations and researchers who have been advocating tirelessly for meaningful improvement to renters' rights, and they also reflect the calls of the Australian Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly proud of this report and the chair's recommendations. However, I find it staggering and extremely disappointing that, despite listening to the devastating testimonies of renters across the country, both the Labor and Liberal parties could not agree to stronger recommendations that reflected the severity of the crisis, leading the committee down the path of separate recommendations from each party in our additional comments. This inquiry made clear that the current government reforms will fail to make up the massive shortfall in affordable housing, will fail to stop skyrocketing rents and consequent increases in homelessness and will certainly fail to fix the housing crisis. By putting forward recommendations that don't address the impact of unregulated rent hikes, the inadequacy of income supports and the ongoing shortage of our affordable housing stock, both parties are revealing their indifference to renters and the housing crisis more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I hope that the Labor government takes this report seriously and implements all 26 of my chair's recommendations, I have very little faith that they will take any meaningful action in response to this report. But know this: while the major parties may continue to ignore the calls of renters, the Greens hear you and we will continue to fight for your rights. We won't stop fighting until unlimited rent increases are illegal, there is enough genuinely affordable public housing for everyone who needs it, renters' rights are strengthened and income support payments are raised to above the poverty line. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Last Friday I was very pleased to present the interim report of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee on the issue of increasing disruption in Australian school classrooms, and I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I would like to thank my fellow committee members, including the deputy chair, Senator Tony Sheldon. Our committee is quite a collegiate team. I note that Senator Allman-Payne is in the chamber, and she'll follow me in speaking on this. While we came to different positions on the issue, we did find a lot of common ground throughout the inquiry, and I certainly appreciated her collegiality and dedication to the issues and that she was present at most of the hearings that we were able to hold. I'd like to thank those that made submissions and appeared in front of the committee at hearings. I particularly want to thank Professor Tom Bennett, the independent behaviour adviser to the Department for Education in the UK. He joined us for a short video call all the way from London. It was quite late in the evening for him, and I appreciated him appearing before the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment ranked Australia 69th out of 76 countries in terms of classroom discipline, meaning that we have some of the most disruptive classrooms in the world. Not only was I shocked to read that, but I was also deeply troubled. We know that we have a great education system here in Australia, and we know that it is essential that our children receive a quality education. Yet we're seeing a third of our students fail to meet the new proficiency standards for literacy and numeracy. We're seeing massive rates of teacher attrition and burnout. As adults—parents and carers charged with raising and nurturing the next generation—we'll do them a disservice if we leave them functionally illiterate or innumerate. In the words of Katharine Birbalsingh, headmistress of Michaela Community School in the UK, 'Being compassionate with a child, caring and loving a child means holding the line.' We need evidence based methods of teaching and learning to help our students learn in the classroom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Education Research Organisation have been calling for teachers to be taught the science of learning and for it to be mandated as core content for our teachers in training. We know that these methods, including explicit instruction, formative assessment and mastery learning, are effective because the research actually shows that they are. And it shows that this is in fact how a child's brain learns. As they say, the proof is in the pudding. We can see these methods in action in classrooms right around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the inquiry process, the committee conducted some site visits to schools that we heard were achieving some wonderful results. It was really important that this committee took an evidence based approach and looked for the strengths in our school system so that we could provide some clear recommendations that pointed to what is actually working. We wanted to see firsthand who was doing this and who was providing best practice in our schools. I've spoken about Challis Community Primary School many times in this place—I've stood here and done that—and I continue to champion this incredible school that's not too far from where I live and where my office is. It's a great school, but it is in a very low-socioeconomic area, and therefore it's achieving better than postcode results in the suburbs of Armadale. Dawson Park Primary School is another great school in Western Australia. It's another stellar example of a school that is defying the odds, and it's also achieving better than postcode results, with NAPLAN results improving each year. On the other side of the country, we visited Marsden Road Public School in Liverpool, outside of Sydney. More than 90 per cent of the student population come from a non-English-speaking background, but their academic outcomes are improving year on year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things that these three schools have in common with each other, and I'll take you through just a few of them. Firstly, they have clear expectations around behaviour. They have adequate training for staff around these expectations and, importantly, how they can apply them in the classroom. The consistent and fair application is also there when they apply these rules and expectations. In addition to all that—and I think this is possibly the most important factor—these three schools are led by very courageous principals. The tenacity and vision that these principals display are phenomenal, and I want to point them out. Firstly, there's Lee Musumeci at Challis Community Primary School, who's wonderful. I've known Lee for a long time. She's magnificent. The leadership that she's shown—I think she's been at that school for over two decades. There's Pauline Johnson at Dawson Park Primary School and Manisha Gazula at Marsden Road Public School. They're three wonderful principals. We should give them an Order of Australia medal, I think; they're magnificent—if they haven't already got one, that is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The schools led by these three women are exceptional examples of how we can do the right thing by our children and provide them with a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy. Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could just copy and paste them and what they do in their school and have every school-aged child in Australia benefit from the resolute and compassionate leadership of these magnificent women. Short of that, we should ensure that everyone who chooses to become a teacher and enrols in the university of their choice learns the necessary skills that they will need to rely on in the classroom.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Teachers are crying out for more support, and we are seeing more and more reports of burnout. That's why the report calls for mandated core content for initial teacher education courses to include evidence-based behaviour and classroom management strategies. Reducing disruption and disorder in the classroom isn't about just punishing students. It's also not about piling more work onto our teachers, forcing them to play parent and teacher at the same time. It's actually about learning. It's about freeing up more teaching time. It's about providing a calm, predictable and safe environment for all students to be able to learn in. The key to that is having a whole-school approach, a whole-school commitment to behaviour, and this can be achieved by introducing behaviour curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that behaviour is learnt. No child is born knowing how to behave; they're taught how to behave—how to share, how to take turns—and the fortunate ones are taught this from birth, by their parents and by the community in which they're in. But we know not everyone has been provided with that. If behaviour is learnt it can be taught. Behaviour needs to be taught explicitly to students, with clear expectations communicated by the teacher. A behaviour curriculum sets out the expected behaviours and values of a school, and it's not just a list of prohibited behaviours; it represents the key habits and routines required in schools. Again, it's about making schools and classrooms safe, predictable and equitable places for all students to learn. This is how we can set up our students for success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a pivotal moment, with the National School Reform Agreement currently in the process of being negotiated. We want to see the recommendations in this report incorporated into the next National School Reform Agreement, which will be implemented from 2025 onwards. We know that these reforms will take time to make their way through our universities, schools and classrooms. Fast-tracking these reforms is key to turning these important results around.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2022 PISA results were released earlier this week. While our results in reading, science and mathematics remain relatively stable, as pointed out by Lisa De Bortoli, a senior research fellow at the Australian Council for Education Research:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it's important to recognise that our position in the top 10 is largely due to the performance of other countries dropping below ours …</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Barely half of Australian students achieve the national proficiency standards—51 per cent in maths, 58 per cent in science and 57 per cent in reading. We need the political willpower to follow through with what the evidence is telling us to do. We know that evidence based methods of pedagogy, like explicit instruction and formative assessment, are based on the science of learning. Teachers are crying out for more support. We need to ensure that they are all equipped with the skills and strategies that they rely on in the classroom. It won't be an easy process, and I'm not standing here saying that this is a silver bullet. There's a heck of a lot of responsibility that parents need to take, and of course that needs to happen. Kids should be packing their backpack on the way to school with an expectation to learn. It won't be an easy process, but we should remember that the greatest cruelty we could do to our children is to rob them of their futures by allowing this problem to escalate, cutting down the time that they spend learning in class and ultimately leaving them illiterate and innumerate.</span>

States and territories are already implementing a broad suite of measures to reduce the likelihood and occurrence of human-shark interactions. State and territory Governments invest in this area, with recent record investment for shark mitigation programs, including $85.6 million for the New South Wales Shark Management Program from 2022 to 2026.</span>

The definition of family violence in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Regulations 1994 </span>(the Migration Regulations) is broad and takes into consideration other federal legislation, including the FLA, as well as the laws of States and Territories. It includes conduct towards an alleged victim, a member of their or the perpetrator's family, or towards property, actual or threatened, that causes the alleged victim to reasonably fear for, or to be reasonably apprehensive about, his or her own wellbeing or safety. This definition includes non-physical forms of abuse such as psychological and financial abuse, and would capture a range of dowry-related abuse.</span>

In 2022, the Department of Home Affairs' Procedural Instructions were updated to clarify that when determining whether an act of family violence has been committed by the applicant's sponsoring partner, consideration should be given not only to conduct directly committed by the sponsoring partner, but also whether the sponsoring partner has engaged in any act (or omission) which could reasonably be regarded as relevant family violence perpetrated by the sponsoring partner (via a third party).</span>

This includes a commitment to develop a model for enhanced civil protection and remedies for individuals in or at risk of forced marriage. The Government has also committed to undertake a targeted review of Australia's visa framework, including to identify and reduce vulnerabilities to modern slavery.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I rise to take note of the interim report of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee, on the issue of increasing disruption in Australian school classrooms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens opposed this inquiry from the outset because we saw it for what it is: a way to divert everyone's attention from the real issues impacting students, teachers and schools. This interim report has shown that we were right to do so. It is no surprise that we are seeing an increase in behaviours of concern in the classroom. The vast majority of socioeconomically disadvantaged kids and kids with a disability attend a public school, and right now nearly every single public school in this country is underfunded. What this means is teachers are trying to teach kids in classrooms with windows that don't open, heaters or air conditioners that don't work, technology that fails and no time or space to make adjustments for students who need them. For students with complex needs, it means they don't have access to the specialist support that they require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone working in the education system has a right to feel safe, secure and protected in their workplace. Schools have a unique place in society, serving as both places of education and workspaces. It's teachers who are bearing the brunt of broader socioeconomic challenges and the persistent and chronic underfunding of public education. Instead of facing this head on, the Labor and Liberal parties are happy to perpetuate the myth that teachers are to blame, that they just need to be better prepared and learn to better manage behaviour. We are forcing students into an environment that is not inclusive, where the support and resources that they actually need do not exist. And then we expect overworked and underpaid teachers to simply hold it all together. This is insane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By focusing almost exclusively on training and pedagogy, the Liberal and Labor parties are missing the point. Queensland Advocacy for Inclusion found, through freedom of information, that nearly half of suspended and excluded students have a disability and that students from First Nations communities and in out-of-home care are also disproportionately represented in these statistics. Why, in a wealthy country like Australia, are we not actually addressing the causes of disadvantage? Why do we just accept that hundreds of thousands of kids are coming to school hungry? One in six kids in this country is living in poverty. Why do we just accept that many kids have no choice but to attend a school that isn't able to provide them with support for their disability or trauma or other complex needs?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments do nothing to address disadvantage and then they punish our kids by forcing them into public schools that perpetuate that very disadvantage. The single biggest influencer on a young person's educational outcomes at the moment, and that is including according to PISA, is their level of socioeconomic income. Let me say that again: at the moment, the biggest influence on how well a young person is going to do at school is their family's income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals can bang on all they want about a stricter curriculum and their discipline fantasy. I point out that teachers already explicitly teach behaviour. The state education system in Queensland requires every school to have a set of behaviour expectations and to communicate them to students, parents and carers. The idea that we would task ACARA with creating a subject called 'behaviour' is simply ludicrous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this means nothing when kids are being taught on empty stomachs, are sweltering or freezing in demountables, or are without access to the additional adjustment and supports their disability or learning difficulty demands. We should call this for what it is: a misdirection. Scripted routines and approaches are a profoundly simplistic way to manage students in the classroom. They are the equivalent of educational first aid, which is required when we don't meet students' complex needs in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I point out again that PISA, in its most recent report, told us yet again that the kids at the top in this country are doing just fine and the kids at the bottom are the ones who are falling further behind. I'm not hearing calls for scripted routines and behaviour curriculums in the schools where kids are doing okay. Again: it's the equivalent of educational first aid, which is required when we don't meet students' complex needs. It demonstrates a failure to understand outside drivers, as well as removing any space for nuance, empathy and, importantly, freedom for teachers to manage their classroom using their expertise and judgement. Do you want to know why teachers are leaving the profession? Because their autonomy is being taken away from them. Teaching is not just a science. It is an art as well as a science. Again, I remind you that the kids at the top are doing okay and no-one is telling those schools to start scripting their routines and introducing a behaviour curriculum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that Labor and the coalition have no interest in actually making meaningful changes to education. If they did then they would want every student in this country to have access to a fully funded quality education. But they don't. Even with the government at the moment it's: 'We're on a pathway. We're taking steps.' Come on, people! We need to get this done and we need to get it done now. Instead, we continue this endless theatre of misdirection and finger-pointing, blaming teachers, shaming parents and carers and leaving our young people without hope. In a rich country like this one, that is unacceptable.</span>

I move:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth FOI system is not fit for purpose. The resignation of Mr Leo Hardiman PSM, KC as Freedom of Information Commissioner, on 5 March 2023, is a symptom of a dysfunctional, broken and underfunded Commonwealth FOI system. Mr Hardiman was not prepared to continue in his position of FOI Commissioner because he genuinely believed he did not have the power or the resources to discharge his statutory obligations, the obligations which this parliament, this chamber, imposed upon that position. Mr Hardiman was not prepared to be passive under the status quo. It was in these circumstances that Mr Hardiman made the decision to resign. A majority of the committee considered this to be a position of integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a direct result of Mr Hardiman's resignation, and with the referral from Senator Shoebridge, who served on this committee, this inquiry was established. As a direct result of Mr Hardiman's resignation, a majority of the committee, the coalition members and the Greens, now make the recommendations contained in this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We call for additional resourcing and urgent reform to fix the broken system. We call for statutory time limits for the conduct of information commissioner reviews. We call for a recalibration of information commissioner reviews so the decisions can be issued with the minimum of formality—an ombudsman-like process, with full merits review occurring only at the AAT level. This should expedite the process. We call for reform of the ridiculous situation whereby access to documents can be denied under the FOI system because there has been a change of minister—exactly the situation where the public interest may well demand the disclosure of documents. We call for the streamlining of processes for access to personal information so that such applications do not clog up the FOI process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We call for reconsideration of the three-commissioner model. And we do not call for this as a matter of ideology, as a matter of partisan politics; we call for this because we genuinely believe that the three-commissioner model has failed and needs to be reformed. We recommend that the FOI commissioner be relocated to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and in support of this recommendation we note the increasing obligations of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner with respect to privacy and data protection matters—an increase that could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time of the establishment of the three-commissioner model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is not party political. This is a genuine, good-faith recommendation to address a failure of the system under the current circumstances. We note that the Commonwealth Ombudsman currently undertakes an FOI review function for the ACT government. And we note the very persuasive evidence of Professor John McMillan, who served as the Australian Information Commissioner under the three-commissioner model between 2010 and 2015. This is what he said—Professor McMillan's words, not mine: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While I still believe … in the original OAIC concept, I accept that it may be time to rethink …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At any rate, it seems hard any more to justify a three commissioner model for the OAIC, particularly when that office does not herald its separate information policy function. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the words of Professor John McMillan, Australian Information Commissioner between 2010 and 2015. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We make other recommendations, all in good faith and intended to address the backlogs, the dysfunction and the failure of the FOI system to achieve its objectives. An area of particular concern for Mr Hardiman was the chronic backlog of information commissioner reviews of FOI decisions made at an agency or departmental level. The number of backlogs is a key statistic. How do we know this? We have, under FOI, the brief for the Australian Information Commissioner given to her by the OAIC prior to her giving evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the first page of the brief, under the heading 'Key statistics', are the ages of information commissioner reviews. Those are reviews of original decisions, quite often decisions not to release documents, ongoing at the period close. The date of this table is as at 30 June 2023. And listen to these statistics. This is a system that is broken, and this is exhibit A of a broken system: age of IC reviews ongoing at period close, greater than 48 months—that is more than four years—86; between 36 and 48 months, which is three to four years, 227; between 24 and 36 months, which is between two and three years, backlogged in the system, 342; and between 12 and 24 months, 561. That is 1,216 information commission review applications that have been stuck in the system for more than one year. How many documents could have been released under those applications? But disclosure was refused and the appeals are stuck in the system. This is exhibit A of a broken system. These statistics need to be made public. They should be given prominence in the annual report of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. They should be on the first page of that report. We shouldn't have to go through estimates process and an inquiry process in order to extract those key statistics. These key statistics tell the story of the state of health of our FOI system. It isn't fit for purpose. Urgent reform is required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One final matter: Mr Hardiman raised serious questions regarding employee welfare within the OAIC. I quote from page 53 of the majority report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Hardiman told the committee that several staff members within the FOI branch displayed 'symptoms of unhealthy work stress and traumatisation'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just reflect on that: traumatisation. I note that the OAIC has strongly contested many of Mr Hardiman's allegations. The OAIC response is clearly acknowledged in our report. The OAIC, in its response, has referred to progress on HR matters as measured by their own survey, but let me go to the Information Commissioner's own brief, prepared by her own agency in this regard. Under 'Takeaways from the 2023 employee census', here are some positive results:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">75% of employees are satisfied with their job, which is an increase of 12pp. The 2022 result was 63%.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a pretty poor result in 2022, but there's an improvement. Then we turn to the next page, which states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The OAIC results saw a 5pp increase in the number of employees reporting they strongly agree or agree with feeling burned out by their work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That includes 44 per cent in the FOI branch. On the next page we have this startling paragraph:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">3% of staff were subjected to harassment or bullying. This is a decrease of 8pp on the 2022 results which was 11%. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eleven per cent of staff say they were bullied or harassed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">However, there was an increase of 7pp in relation to staff who were unsure if they had been subjected to harassment or bullying (this primarily comes from a better result from the Corporate Branch). The percentage of staff who reported that had NOT been subjected to harassment or bullying is as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      29.2pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-17.85pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">87% of the FOI Branch</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighty-seven per cent of the staff say they weren't bullied or harassed. I wonder what the corollary of that is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There needs to be reform, there need to be additional resources dedicated to the FOI process. Never again should there be a backlog of Information Commissioner reviews like that which exist today. Never again should a former senator—former senator Rex Patrick—have to go to the Federal Court to try to expedite IC reviews. I note that the appeal of the original decision is laid down for the full bench of that court on 26 February 2024. Never, ever again should an FOI Commissioner find themselves in the position of Mr Leo Hardiman and feel compelled to resign as a matter of integrity. I commend this report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="169119" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHOEBRIDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I rise to echo the comments of Senator Paul Scarr, who chaired the inquiry into the freedom of information system at a Commonwealth level. It was remarkable, the evidence we heard in that inquiry. You could arrive at only this conclusion: that the FOI system is broken. It's not achieving transparency, it's not achieving timeliness, and many people have given up on it as a tool for finding critical information about how the Commonwealth government works. It is literally broken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statistics about delay, and the delay that centres in the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the OAIC, are particularly telling. There are hundreds and hundreds of matters that are more than three years old in that office. Reviews—often for critical government information—have taken at least three years to be delivered. Some are still clogged in that system five years after they were lodged with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. As Senator Scarr made clear, we only know that critical information about the freedom of information system because we squeezed it out of the government and the OAIC in budget estimates and in this inquiry. Astoundingly, these key statistics are not even reported on by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. You could not make it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence that we got from former FOI commissioner Hardiman was also particularly telling. I want to be clear that Mr Hardiman struck me—and I think the majority of the committee, if not all of the committee—as a credible, decent public servant who sought to do what he could in a system that was starving him of funding and deeply disrespectful of his expertise. He struggled on as best he could, but he was doing it in an office that seemed to be consciously structured to prevent the FOI division in the OAIC from having the funds and resources it needed to do its work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to just believe me or the committee report. In the now disclosed APS survey, when the FOI division of the OAIC were asked about the performance of the group and were asked whether their work group has the resources needed to perform, 63 per cent of people in the FOI group said no, 13 per cent were neutral and only 25 per cent said yes. That 63 per cent is double the rate that we find in the overall APS survey of other agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hardiman's complaint was that the current OAIC commissioner deliberately withheld funding from FOI and did so in circumstances where she thought she was complying with a political direction from a former Attorney-General. It was extraordinary and it was contrary to the legal position that allows agency heads to move funds around within their agency to meet the most pressing needs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the committee was not the place to finally resolve all of those elements of workplace dysfunction and organisational dysfunction—we couldn't run every rabbit down every rabbit hole—but what we heard was so disturbing and so troubling that the first recommendation was to have an urgent independent review of those workplace issues raised by Mr Hardiman in the OAIC. That is urgent work. That is why I was astounded to see that just a few weeks before we released this report the Attorney-General thought it prudent to appoint two fresh statutory officeholders to the OAIC without first addressing the extensive management and organisation failures we observed. I believe that that's an action that puts at peril both of those officeholders who go into an office where there is such compelling evidence of dysfunction and managerial failures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not to address that before appointing two new statutory officeholders—what was the Attorney-General thinking? It's not as though he wasn't aware of the evidence. There were Labor members on the committee. Much of this evidence was in public. How could the Attorney in good conscience have appointed two new statutory officeholders knowing that this dysfunction was in place, without first addressing it? It is genuinely unbelievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish both of those appointees every positive wish that I can. They go with the Greens' good wishes, but they go with our very real concern for what they will face as they seek to undertake their essential statutory functions in that office. It was an extraordinarily arrogant step of the Attorney to simply ignore the evidence we saw in that committee and to pretend that you could just appoint two people and it would work. Extraordinary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee, I believe, operated in a nonpartisan fashion. We had very difficult evidence to deal with and we could have delivered a report that was excoriating of individuals. We endeavoured not to do that and to recommend an independent review. We also recommended some structural changes because—as a former Commonwealth Ombudsman found and as many of the witnesses said—putting the privacy functions together with the FOI functions creates an inherent tension because much of privacy is about keeping information secret and not providing it to third parties, whereas the core function of FOI is to put as much information as possible into the public domain. They obviously have significant tensions, and those tensions have only increased as the sheer amount of work required in the privacy space has grown and grown—and for good reason. No-one begrudges the work in the privacy space, but the fact is that work in the privacy space has been happening for the last near-decade at the expense of literally stripping every marginal resource out of FOI. That has led to the FOI system sort of grinding to a halt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have hoped that we would have had better than the dissenting report from the government on this, which seeks to suggest that this recommendation was, somehow, a partisan attack on the OAIC. Far from it. It was a reluctant conclusion that that experiment has not worked. It was a reluctant conclusion we came to because that's where the evidence compelled us. There are good, principled reasons to disassociate those, not to throw the FOI system into its own tiny little agency but to embed it in an agency that has a similar kind of public purpose—which is the Ombudsman's office. In South Australia that's where it's found anyhow, and many of the witnesses we had said the South Australian model is actually pretty bloody good. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">
                    </span>What were the other critical recommendations we had? They were to simplify the process and remove an often wasteful internal review and instead put those agency resources into getting the primary and first decision right; to spend the resources where they're best spent, which is getting the initial decision right; and to remove internal reviews and then have the first independent merits review done without the requirement to deliver lengthy, near-judicial reasons. Make that quick and make that a decision-making process rather than a judgement-making process, with an empowered and well-resourced FOI commissioner, and then give ready access to the AAT for a full merits review. That's a model that will work. That's a model that will simplify and speed up the process and make it about freedom of information, not freedom from information, which is what the current system is. None of it will work—not the existing system and not the reformed system—without a significant increase in resources to deal with the backlog and make it fit for purpose.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the royal commission, in 1992 the government announced it would provide $7 million to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—what we know as ATSIC—to improve coordination between the Commonwealth, states and territories and to monitor progress by governments in implementing the recommendations of the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was recommendation 1, and it came from a Labor government who were willing to listen to our people and the families of those who had died in custody, and, more importantly, they were willing to act by properly resourcing First Nations led bodies to do the work of overseeing the implementation of that royal commission. This work that ATSIC did was crucial, and it was done by predominantly First Nations people—as the closest we've gotten to a self-determined body—and the work that ATSIC did monitoring the implementations of the royal commission was an integral part of this. It put fires in our belly and gave our people a sense of control and understanding that our rights were being respected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1992 the Keating government also announced that it would establish the office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, who would head up a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice unit within the Human Rights and Equal Community Commission, now called the Australian Human Rights Commission. The social justice commissioner was tasked with preparing an annual state-of-the-nation report on the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This related to recommendations 211 and 212 of the royal commission. At the time of establishment, the commissioner was and is responsible for reporting on and promoting 'the exercise and enjoyment of human rights by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons'. Of course, reporting on human rights frequently involved considering the implementation of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommendations, but it was not a specified responsibility. The first commissioner was Mick Dodson, who said in his first report in 1993:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given that many of the recommendations focus on issues which relate to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, there is an obvious and most important relationship between the work of my Commission and the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also commented on the royal commission, noting that ATSIC was responsible for monitoring. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It would be wasteful and inappropriate for my Commission to attempt to duplicate the work of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's unit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In subsequent years, the social justice commissioner highlighted different aspects of the royal commission in their work. In 1996, they produced a report that assessed the coroner's reports into the 96 Aboriginal deaths in custody that occurred between 1989 and 1996, which found that each death was characterised by breaches of, on average, 8.5 recommendations and that rates of Indigenous death in custody had increased. The report cast severe doubt on the accuracy of self-reporting, against the recommendations by justice agencies, which all claimed to have implemented them. Does that sound surprising—government agencies claiming that they've ticked the box and implemented the recommendations, despite our people continuing to be murdered at the hands of the state?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about First Nations rights, we are talking about First Nations lives. Every death in custody is a murder at the hands of the state. There are 555 recorded deaths of First Peoples in custody since the royal commission. But we know that, if you counted all of the other circumstances where violence has been committed against our people by police, security officers and the violent colonial system, this number is much, much bigger. Yet no-one has ever been found guilty of an Indigenous death in custody in Australia—not one person. The numbers speak for themselves, yet all we hear is that the recommendations have been implemented or that they're irrelevant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ATSIC was defunded in 2005, and, since then, the crucial work of coordinating across jurisdictions to ensure our people stop being killed by the state has been abandoned. Almost 20 years later, we are still waiting for justice. Monitoring the implementation of 339 recommendations endorsed by the Commonwealth government is a huge task. To do so adequately and to ensure that the implementation substantially fulfils the intentions of the royal commission is an even greater task. The social justice commissioner plays an important role in upholding and promoting our rights. It would be well suited to play a role in preventing any more of our people dying in custody but must be properly resourced to do this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year marked 40 years since the death of John Pat. The government continues to maintain that many of the recommendations are either outdated or not able to be acted upon by the Commonwealth. The last review was handed down in 2018 by Deloitte. It was widely dismissed by experts as misleadingly positive and largely worthless, which allowed the government to hide behind the veneer of simply having introduced policies and programs which it claims have addressed recommendations. Deloitte did a desktop review and counted even the slightest action towards a recommendation as that recommendation being fully implemented, even if it had absolutely no impact on the lives of our people in prisons. It was just a tick-a-box-process desktop review. Even worse, this kind of gammon review helps governments to dismiss any calls for justice and to wipe their hands clean of responsibility. Our men, women and children continue to be over-policed and over-represented in every aspect of the criminal justice system. In the words of journalist Amy McGuire, a Darumbal and South Sea islander woman:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For Aboriginal people, every death, every injury, every grieving mother, is remembered. They are not just numbers. We remember and we watch and we protest in the face of this national silence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is nothing shocking about racist violence perpetrated by police, … it is normalised. It is seen as legitimate violence … that was not only used to steal the country and assert white dominance, but also maintain it through the oppression of Aboriginal people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the fundamental cause of these deaths is the criminalisation of our people and the conditions created by over 250 years of racist colonial domination. I will not stay silent on this. The families of those who have been murdered will not stay silent. The people on the streets will not stay silent. We will fill your ears with our pain until they bleed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission is something that will save people's lives. Those recommendations are important to our people. We know which recommendations are the responsibility of the state and the Territory. We've pulled out the recommendations that belong in this place. We've done the work. We have to save lives—black lives. Black lives still matter. You might not have seen a protest for a while, but black lives still matter. We can make a difference in people's lives and change things through this parliament and just do the right thing. All we're asking in this instance, through this one recommendation, is that someone actually take responsibility for oversight of a royal commission that cost this country a lot of money to run, had a lot of good people involved and had a lot of good solutions. We just need to get on with the business of implementing the rest of those recommendations. We know that the states and territories are responsible for removing hanging points, and we hope that—well, no, I'm not going to use the word 'hope'. There's a whole chapter on that in Chelsea Watego's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Another Day in the Colony</span>. I suggest you all read it. By removing hanging points, where our people are hanging themselves in states' and territories' systems is something that we can also influence from this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can we get on with implementing the recommendations? Can we give someone the responsibility? The social justice commissioner is there, all ready, and we have an Aboriginal woman in that job who is more than capable of fulfilling this role, but we also know that resources will need to be a part of that process so that they're not overwhelmed with what is, hopefully, coming for them. Thank you.</span>

It's not for the government or the Senate to direct her about how she exercises her functions. I don't think anyone would disagree that the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody relates to the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. The commissioner is already able to, and in fact often does, promote the implementation of the recommendations of the royal commission within her existing functions. On that basis, I indicate that government will support the motion.</span>
