        In my view there should be robust debate in this country about the size of our immigration policy. People are entitled to attack the present immigration levels without being branded as bigots or racists. That was the point that I made in my speech to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. I also made another point which my detractors have sought to ignore, and that is that people who exercise free speech have an obligation to do so in a sensitive and caring fashion. That has always been my credo. I make no apology for that. But it has also been my credo that, if someone disagrees with the prevailing orthodoxy of the day, that person should not be denigrated as a narrow&amp;hyphen;minded bigot.

        I can remember early in 1992 when unemployment went to a very high level, and the minister at that time was the current Leader of the Opposition. The former opposition leader, John Hewson, and I both called for a reduction in the overall level of immigration because of its link with the level of unemployment. For our pains, we were bucketed by the former Prime Minister as racist. He actually used that expression. That is the kind of behaviour that I regard as absolutely unacceptable.

        I might say to the Leader of the Opposition that a couple of weeks ago I visited Jakarta and Tokyo. In the latter city, after meeting the Japanese Prime Minister and attending a news conference which was attended, so I am advised, by a record number of local media representatives for an Australian Prime Minister, not one question was addressed to me about Australia's immigration policy. The reason one was not addressed to me is that it is accepted in countries such as Japan that a non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory immigration policy is now and has for many years been a bipartisan given of Australian politics.

         These amendments are the result of very extensive consultation. We remain committed to retaining the Native Title Act, but we want to make it more workable for the benefit of all people affected by it, and we will do this in a manner that completely respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. We have, as I am sure all members interested in this subject know, undertaken very extensive consultation with all of the groups that are concerned and involved. We want to achieve a fair balance between the legitimate interests of government and industry and also the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         A number of proposals included in the amending bill introduced into this House at the end of the last sitting occurred after extensive consultation with a wide variety of interest groups. Further extensive consultations have been undertaken since that time on the contents of the bill in the three major areas that were not covered: firstly, the right to negotiate; secondly, the role of representative bodies; and, thirdly, the recognition of agreements with native title holders about mining and other development activity.

         In relation to the right to negotiate, that process will be streamlined in the new amendments to ensure that it is only necessary for a mining project to go through the process once and that negotiations with native title holders for that purpose focus on the actual impact of the mine on their native title. To prevent a repeat of the Century situation, the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs will be able to ensure that a project of major economic benefit to Australia can proceed if it appears that that benefit will be lost if a decision is not made urgently.

         The registration test is being revised to prevent a repetition of the situation where multiple claims are made over the same area and registered without satisfying any real test as to the likelihood of establishing the existence of native title.

        In relation to the inquiry which was established by the former government, it is true that, as the press reports, I wrote to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in July, saying that the government had reservations about the practical benefit of the inquiry. That was not the first time I had given voice to that discussion. In fact, in a meeting between myself and Mr Michael Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which was held on 22 April this year—only about seven weeks after the government had been sworn in—he raised the question of the inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal children. I will read from the record of the meeting which was compiled not by a member of my staff but by the deputy secretary of my department. It reads:

        The chairman had written to the Prime Minister about terms of reference and financial difficulties. The Prime Minister said he could not give any commitment on funding and there was a question in his mind over the long&amp;hyphen;term value and practical contribution of the inquiry. He stood ready to meet Mr Wilson and Commissioner Dodson before a final decision was made on future funding. He was not unsympathetic, but the coalition did not have
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the same attitude to the issue as the former government. Commissioner Dodson spoke of the circumstances of those affected, the importance of this issue and the injustices encountered to understanding today's problems for the indigenous community. The Prime Minister said he understood the intensity of feeling, but even people of goodwill may form the judgment that there was not a lot to be gained from an expensive inquiry on long past policy.

        I think those practices, by the standards of today, whatever your politics are, would be quite unacceptable. I have absolutely no doubt that they caused immense trauma and immense unhappiness to the people concerned. I have, equally, no doubt that it is always a difficult exercise in our kind of society to impose the standards and attitudes of today on the conduct of yesterday. I think it is also fair to say, although it is probably, in the current climate of debate on these issues, difficult to do without being jumped on, that some of the people who were involved in the maintenance of those practices genuinely at the time believed that what they were doing was right. I think that must be borne in mind.

        The view that the government takes is that the additional resources that might otherwise be devoted to this inquiry, additional to those that were devoted under the decisions of the former government, would be better employed in contributing towards improving health, education, housing and employment opportunities of Aboriginal people. That is a legitimate point of view. It is not an insensitive point of view. I have a completely sensitive understanding of the feelings of the Aboriginal community on this. But I do not apologise for the fact that we have a different policy on this issue from that of the former government.

We do not make any apology for that, and we never will.

        Dr Rolf Zinkernagel is a Swiss scientist who came to the ANU to do post-doctoral studies with Professor Doherty. Together they were looking at properties of cells in the body and the response of the immune system. What they discovered was that when a virus infects a cell of the body a protein on the surface of that cell changes and that leads to the development of the body's response to the foreign virus. This formed the basis of a number of vaccines that are in use today.

        I understand the substance known as Fantasy, which caused the illness at the nightclub in Queensland, probably contained a substance called sodium oxybate. It is called sodium gamma hydroxybutyrate. Sodium oxybate is an anaesthetic agent that is available and used in Germany and France. It is not a registered therapeutic good and no approvals for its registration have been sought or given. For this reason, importation of sodium oxybate into Australia for supply to others is an offence under the Therapeutic Goods Act.

        I understand the chief health officers of Australia are going to be meeting on 14 and 15 October. They have jurisdictional responsibility for action regarding sodium hydroxybutyrate. They will be looking at this as a matter of urgency, and I certainly endorse this response.

        I am sure all honourable members are concerned about the popularity of these party drugs and what little is known about them amongst young people and how what is happening on the Gold Coast may reflect what is happening in other parts of Australia. As with all drugs that are the subject of abuse, it is important to try to balance supply side measures with measures that will minimise harm and measures on the demand side as well. The availability of gamma hydroxybutyrate, or Fantasy, by my department is being considered a matter of urgency by the TGA.

The Murray is currently experiencing high water levels as a result of recent rains and some moderate downstream flooding has occurred. It should be noted that those current water levels have been reached or exceeded during 10 of the last 30 years—most

        I am assured—and I know this is of real concern to the members involved and people who live in that area—that the shift which has occurred in the dam wall is not the result of the recent high water levels. In fact, a program of investigations and remedial works at Hume Dam has been under way for a number of years. We did announce in the recent federal budget that we would be providing $5.9 million over the next three years for the necessary works to be undertaken.

        The cost of construction of the Hume Dam was, in the first place, contributed to by New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia as well as by the Commonwealth. Under present arrangements, the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation maintains the structure pursuant to an agreement with Victoria and the storage in accordance with directions from the Murray Darling Basin Commission. It is a split responsibility.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Recent work carried out on the dam has revealed movement of some five millimetres in the core wall at the junction of the concrete spillway and the main embankment. Following an engineering report by the New South Wales constructing authority, it was felt that the work should begin without delay and that the water level should be reduced by two metres in the next two weeks and by a further three metres by the end of the year. That would substantially increase the safety margin from the current 15 per cent to around 35 per cent. Fifty per cent is regarded as the normal accepted benchmark for dams in general.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I am assured by the commission that there is no immediate cause for concern. They are taking the precautions of lowering the water and bringing forward the remedial works to ensure that the dam meets contemporary safety standards. I am advised that a detailed community information program is currently being developed.

        The Labor stick for the big end of town was R&amp;D tax syndicates. That is what it was. The Labor stick for the big end of town was improved concessions on employer deductible superannuation. The Labor stick for the big end of town was not any increase in the Medicare surcharge for high income earners. This was the side of the House that had the policy response to deal with this. This was the side of the House that had the courage to engage in it. That is the side of the House that has secret, undisclosed tax plans, which they will not be letting out until that by-election in Lindsay is over.

No group in the Australian community was more seriously disadvantaged by the failures of the previous  government in economic management than school leavers. The fact is that Labor essentially deserted school leavers. The 65 per cent of young people who were not going on to university or full-time study in TAFE had very few options before them apart from the dole.

        When the former government introduced the Working Nation program and told young people that they were going to get jobs, there was absolutely no shift in teenage unemployment over the whole period of Working Nation—from its introduction until the election. Youth unemployment had skyrocketed up to 32 per cent during the recession caused by the previous government. The apprenticeship scheme was left to wither on the vine. The number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was at the lowest level for three decades.

        Last week I announced the first school based traineeships under the government's apprenticeship reforms. Under these school based traineeships, students will be able to combine their secondary school certificate with a nationally recognised qualification in office administration, leading to careers in management, marketing, sales and accounting. New school based apprenticeships are on the way, and they will be here as soon as the opposition passes the workplace relations legislation in the Senate. Young people will be able to have the opportunities that are presently being denied to them by the Labor Party, fully in accordance with this long tradition.

        Last week I also announced details of the jobs pathway program, for which the government has allocated in the budget some $5.9 million in funding over the next two years. We will be contracting with job brokers to help secure employment and make the connections between students doing vocational education courses in schools and local employers.

        In the recent budget, the government set aside $187 million to expand vocational education in schools. We have entered into an historic alliance with the secondary school principals of Australia. We will be working on a working party with secondary principals right around Australia to make sure that these opportunities which the previous government failed to deliver will be delivered to the 30 per cent of young people who are leaving school before year 12. Australia's young people hold the key to the future of this country, and this government is going to make sure that school leavers have a clear and solid pathway into employment and quality training which they were denied by the previous government.

         —I thank the member for Sturt for his question. There is of course a dramatic difference between this government and the previous government in addressing some of the key educational issues facing young people. When this government came to office, the first consultation we held with major business organisations indicated that illiteracy and lack of numeracy skills were the biggest single obstacles to young people getting jobs after 13 years of the previous government. I have already commented on the decline in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force, and of course hardly any progress at all was made during the period of the previous government in providing vocational education opportunities for young people in schools.

        I suppose in the minds of many members of the House the questions that arise are, `Who was responsible for policy in this area? Who was responsible for the vast policy vacuum in the Labor Party?' The answer is the previous minister in that government for schools, vocational education and training—none other than the previous member for Lindsay, the Hon. Ross Free. Ross Free gave new meaning to the notion of transparency in policy. He was totally invisible; the invisible minister.

         —Just let me detail some elements of this policy vacuum represented by the former Labor member for Lindsay. As the apprenticeship opportunities for young Australians declined, he uttered the word `apprenticeship' only 10 times in this House in three years—that is three times a year. The parliament was fortunate if he managed to address literacy in this House three or four times a year, if he cared to do so, and he addressed the issue of numeracy on only four occasions in this House over the whole three years. Civics education and vocational education rated barely a mention.

        The fact is that this former minister turned invisibility and policy lassitude into an art form. It is no wonder that on 2 March the voters in Lindsay decided that he should disappear. When you tried to turn up the contrast to see him, you realised it was already on high.

Do you recall that your guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility, which you issued publicly in April 1996, says at page 10, `Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public'? Did you also see the editorial in the

If it is important for him to keep faith with Dr Greenspan, it is even more imperative that he keep faith with the voters who elevated him to a position of trust'? What action have you taken with regard to your Treasurer to ensure that he upholds his ministerial guidelines?

         We do have very extensive people to people contacts with France. While I was in Paris, I took the opportunity of raising with the French government the establishment of visa-free travel for Australians in France. I know the requirement to obtain a visa to visit France is a significant irritant for Australians who want to go to that country, be it for business or pleasure, and many of course do. The French government, in light of the introduction of our electronic travel authority, is giving consideration now to providing visa-free travel for Australians into France. I very much hope that that will take place.

         The final point I would like to make is that Australia and France do have mutual interests in our own respective regions.

I also welcome France's growing interests in the economies of the Asia-Pacific and the fact that many French companies are now using Australia as a base for their Asia-Pacific operations. Given that France is a significant member of the European Union, our work with France in that context too is of great use to us and I think is of value to our bilateral relationship.

         —Mr Speaker, you might recall that, when this matter was raised with you by me originally, it was put to you that because of my position as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business you were agreeable to me addressing the chamber from the dispatch box in that capacity. If the point of view that the member for La Trobe is putting to you is not a nonsense, it would mean that at any time the member for Gippsland wished to address the House as the Deputy Leader of the House when the leader was sitting in the House or anywhere in the vicinity of the House you would probably have to sit him down.

        I suggest that the proposition put forward by the member for La Trobe is a nonsense. Indeed, when the member for Gippsland addresses the House in his position as Deputy Leader of the House, it is just as reasonable that I should be allowed to address the House in my position as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. The deputy in any of these areas is not just in the House when his leader is. On that nonsensical proposition of the

It is the normal course of events to take a censure motion immediately upon it being moved.

         —by leave—I will be tabling in parliament today the Commission of Inquiry report into the Relations between the Civil Aviation Authority and Seaview Air. This inquiry was established following the crash on 2 October 1994 of Seaview's Aero Commander VH&amp;hyphen;SVQ, with the loss of all nine lives on board. This inquiry highlights how a litany of lies and incompetence led to the deaths of nine people.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This report is a damning indictment of the CAA and reveals Seaview as an unsafe organisation, a slipshod and often wilfully non&amp;hyphen;compliant organisation in which breaches of regulations and unacceptable practices were commonplace. The report found that the aircraft was significantly overloaded and that the pilot's licence was not valid.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The flight in question was estimated to be overloaded by between 261 and 288 kilograms. That is the equivalent of three adult
        <break page="4877" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         male passengers in an aircraft whose maximum capacity was nine passengers. Even on the most favourable calculation to Seaview, the extent of the overloading was estimated to be some 220 kilograms. The commission found that Seaview's pilots regularly overloaded aircraft primarily due to the subtle but unmistakable pressure exerted by Seaview's management.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        And where was the regulator? The safety watchdog? Despite repeated warnings, Seaview was allowed to continue to fly. On 13 January 1994, the district airworthiness manager at Coffs Harbour, Mr Bob Hoy, urged the suspension of the company's air operators certificate. On 16 April that year he went to Canberra to see the then chief executive of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to press his concerns.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yet his warnings were ignored. Mr Hoy was trying to do what he was paid to do and what the public expected of him—ensuring the safety regulations are complied with. He insisted on standards and he was right to do so. Yet he was perceived by his superiors as being out of step. He subsequently suffered persecution within the organisation. The report shows how, as in the Monarch case, the CAA had placed commercial considerations ahead of the safety of passengers. The commission found:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In its efforts to please and appease industry, the management of the CAA, and certainly those who managed Mr Hoy, seemed to regard standards set by the regulations and orders as negotiable. In the face of a determined operator, such standards were sacrificed or moderated in order to neutralise a complaint.

        The commission also recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should, having regard to the evidence before the commission and its own investigation, take disciplinary action where appropriate. The commission identified lying and covering&amp;hyphen;up by staff within the former CAA, as well as by people involved with Seaview. There could be no more fundamental criticism of the behaviour of the regulator. The integrity of those individuals in positions of responsibility is essential if the public is to have confidence in the regulator.

         The commission makes important recommendations in relation to the vital roles of the maintenance controller and chief pilot in the running of an airline.

         It is important to remember that this report provides only a snapshot of the behaviour of the regulator and the operations of just one small airline. The parallels with the Monarch case are obvious. The CAA was warned that Monarch was flying in breach of safety regulations and yet failed to act on a recommendation from an airworthiness inspector that Monarch's air operators certificate be either revoked or suspended.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In his report on the Monarch crash released in June this year, the coroner spoke of an atmosphere of intimidation of officers who sought to take such action and he concluded that had CAA management paid more attention to the law and less to accommodating its `customers', then Monarch would have been grounded and those deaths avoided.

          In July last year, the commercial air traffic services operations of the CAA were placed with a government business enterprise, Airservices Australia, and the safety regulatory functions vested in a separate statutory authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. But changing the name does not solve the problems. While there have been some worthwhile changes, particularly at Airservices, I am not satisfied that sufficient change has taken place within the safety regulator. I expect, and the public will demand, that CASA take strong and swift action in re sponse to the recommendations of Commissioner Staunton.

         I reiterate my concerns about the lack of aviation experience on the board of CASA. Since their appointment more than 12 months ago, I am not aware of the board having made any serious attempt to change the culture of CASA, and I cannot think of a CASA non&amp;hyphen;executive board member having ever addressed an industry meeting or conference outlining a vision for reform of CASA.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a need for strong leadership and a knowledge and understanding of the industry by board members to enable them to keep ahead of the bureaucracy. I remain dissatisfied with the performance of the board in this regard and this report reinforces the importance of appointing to the board of CASA strong individuals with relevant aviation experience and the drive for reform. The role of the board is to lead and not merely rubber stamp or monitor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In light of my concerns developed through my investigations into the Monarch disaster, and now equipped with the findings of Commissioner Staunton, I am totally convinced that substantial change within CASA is absolutely essential. This can best be achieved by having in charge of CASA a board with appropriate skills and relevant experience. I appreciate that individual members of the present board are highly qualified in their respective professions. But, just as it has taken them years of diligent effort to gain those qualifications, it will also take them years to become aviation experts. The millions of Australians who climb aboard an airplane each year can't afford to wait for them to gain that expertise.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="4879" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          It is for this reason that I repeat my request for them to step aside; to enable people who are expert to take charge; to implement change; to make CASA a better safety regulator; to make flying safer. I am not empowered under the legislation to remove board members who lack appropriate skills. As the minister responsible, I am required to assure the safety of the Australian public. And yet I cannot state that I have confidence in the skills of the board to ensure that their statu tory responsibility to protect the travelling public is carried out.

         I find this personally distressing, particularly when I know there are many fine and capable people within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who are desperately awaiting the right leadership and vision from the board. I can only hope that Commissioner Staunton's report will have sufficient impact to motivate the board to resign and make way for others.

         I will table this two&amp;hyphen;volume report with the knowledge that the tragic events that took place involving Seaview Air in October 1994 occurred despite warnings that I made in this House in May 1994 about this specific airline's operations. Those warnings were quite clear and can be summarised by the following statement I made about Seaview in parliament on 4 May 1994 which indicated that `this airline, which was operating so dangerously and which was putting people's lives at risk, continued to fly'. It gives me no satisfaction to know that those concerns were subsequently, and most sadly, proven correct. The parallels with the Monarch tragedy in 1993 are all too evident. Once again, here was an operator who, despite showing all the signs of breaching regulations and who should not have been flying, continued to fly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again we had a safety regulator that, instead of taking decisive action against safety breaches, acted indifferently and, even worse still, went out of its way to ensure that the airline continued to fly. Commissioner Staunton described it as the `institutional timidity of the CAA'. The commissioner's summation of the former CAA's oversight of Seaview was `in three years it did very little and discovered almost nothing'. No statement could better sum up the absolute incompetence of the CAA.

The inquiry had 142 witnesses, received over 900 exhibits and sat for 224 days of hearings and produced almost 17,000 pages of transcript.

         Not surprisingly, many of the key findings and recommendations in the commissioner's report complement the conclusions of two previous reports on aviation safety.

As a member of that committee, I can honestly say that it revealed a number of

As I said then:

Thirteen years ago, it was criticised by Sir Sydney Frost QC, who had inquired into the Advance Airlines crash that killed 13 people in 1980. The failures of the then regulator, the Department of Transport, are remarkably similar to those highlighted by the Monarch and Seaview disasters.

          The time has come for CASA to respond to these recurring criticisms of aviation safety regulation through rebuilding its reputation by taking appropriate action against those who bring the aviation industry into disrepute, including its own staff.

         —by leave—I first wish to join the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in expressing my sincere condolences to the families and friends of those involved in the Seaview disaster, and in commending Commissioner Staunton for his work in investigating the causes of this disaster.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The conclusions that Commissioner Staunton has reached with respect to the Seaview disaster can perhaps best be summed up in the phrase that appears a couple of times in his report: `the institutional timidity of the former Civil Aviation Authority'. It is quite horrifying when you read through the list of non-compliance by the operator and read the things that were permitted to occur because of the failure of the CAA officers to take action when they should have taken action.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They include the case of a flying operations inspector who failed to conduct appropriate inspections; who took excuses at face value from the operator for defects; who was aware of the fact that an illegal regular passenger transport operation was being flown and did nothing; who, when complaints were received from the chief pilot of Seaview, actually disclosed the identity of the complainer to the operator when he raised the complaints with the operator; who failed to investigate problems that had been raised with the CAA by customers through complaints; and who presided over the upgrading of Seaview to regular passenger transport status, in spite of all the obvious things that were wrong with the operation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then there was the regional manager who failed to adequately supervise the flying operations inspector and wrongly imposed restrictions on another inspector who, quite
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         properly, was seeking to point to the deficiencies in the Seaview operation and the failure of supervision that was occurring. There were also more senior officers who had been asked by the then CEO of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to do a proper audit of the Seaview situation in response to complaints, and who failed to do so not on one occasion but on two occasions. It would appear that Mr Roser failed to follow up his own request in this regard.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The conclusion reached by Mr Staunton was that `CAA saw its role as satisfying the customer rather than regulating the operator'. The factors that appear to have led to the disaster include: the flight was overloaded by at least 260 kilograms; the pilot may have been affected by antibiotics that he was currently taking and possibly analgesics; the pilot did not have a current medical clearance, his previous medical certificate expired some three weeks previously; and, perhaps most significantly, the flight plan provided for a flight altitude of 12,000 feet which was ignored in spite of the obvious icing risk which was the subject of a prohibition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are some background points that I will make which are relevant to the minister's response today. The first is the battle that the minister has engaged in with the CASA board since he has become the minister and which he reiterated today in his comments on the report. Very early in his term as minister he asked by letter, by telephone and in a meeting the CASA board to resign. This was despite the fact that they had only been in office for nine months and had not taken office until some considerable time after both the Monarch and the Seaview disasters. His reason for doing so, which he reiterated today, was that they lacked relevant aviation experience. The board comprises: Mr Justice Fisher, who is the chief judge of the Industrial Court of New South Wales; Mr Geoff Molloy, a retired Qantas pilot; Ms Clare Pollock, who is a systems safety expert; and Ms Gabi Hollows, a consumer advocate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister has more or less implied in various public arenas that the role of the CASA board is very much hands on and that it more or less checks the planes itself. The
        <break page="4883" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         real role of the board is to ensure compliance with the act. Its responsibilities include legal, accounting and management issues as well as aviation issues. It administers the organisation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister has submitted legislation, which has gone through the House but not the Senate, to extend the size of the board by two and to create a deputy chair position in order to partially achieve the objectives he set himself. There has been wide speculation that a strong financial supporter of the coalition in its last election campaign, Mr Dick Smith, the former president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, would be one of the two appointees. This is speculation that Mr Smith has certainly fostered and the minister has done nothing to quell.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In a ministerial statement on 25 June, which today's statement reflects and does not greatly add to, the minister claimed that the board of CASA had been putting its own interests ahead of the interests of aviation safety in Australia. That is a very strong and serious charge. He did not produce any evidence to support this claim other than their refusal to accept his request to resign. The chairman of the board, Mr Justice Fisher, then put out a press release denying this accusation, as I think he was entitled to do. The minister then put out a press release in response to Mr Fisher's press release accusing him of a lack of loyalty.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Leaving aside the obvious peculiarity of a minister engaging in a war of press releases with his own statutory authority head, the fact remains that the minister has been inappropriately targeting the board of the Civil Aviation  Safety Authority for matters that it cannot be blamed for because it has only been in office for a relatively short period. The path the minister is proposing to follow cannot be seen as the solution to the problems that are manifestly apparent from both the coronial inquiry into the Monarch disaster and the report that he has tabled today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This rather cavalier approach to the administration of safety regulations can also be seen in the minister's approach to the matter of electronic locator transmitters. This is a very complex issue. There has been a very lively
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         debate on this between CASA and particularly AOPA as to the respective merits of fixed ELTs as opposed to hand&amp;hyphen;held ELTs.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The best that can be said with respect to this debate is that neither is universally better than the other in terms of safety. There are some situations where it would be preferable to have fixed ELTs and other situations where it would be preferable to have hand-held ELTs. It is worthy of note that when the minister overrode CASA's advice mandating fixed ELTs—which was in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation's standard—and requiring them to allow hand-held ELTs as an alternative, the general manager of flying operations at CASA, Mr Holger Von Muenchhausen, wrote a memo to his superiors on 16 May 1996 which stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The decisions are detrimental to the safety of survivors of aviation accidents and do not have the support of technical specialists within the flying operations branch.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have expressed before, I sincerely hope that we are not in this House at some point in the future examining a report from a coroner which concludes that somebody has died in a search and rescue situation because there was no fixed ELT in the aircraft. If that is the case, it will be on the minister's head because he has overridden his own safety experts and imposed a different decision on them, running very strongly the agenda of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and Mr Dick Smith.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no better illustration of the extent of his association with the AOPA agenda than the recent fiasco surrounding the regulatory review that the minister referred to in his comments today. As indicated, he appointed an 11&amp;hyphen;member program advisory panel to oversee the review of civil aviation safety regulations. This panel is representative of the different elements within the industry. It elected Mr David Wiltshire, the chair of the Aviation Industry Council, as its chair. The minister rejected this and said, `No, I want Boyd Munro from AOPA as the chair of the program advisory panel.' When this was made known, Mr Munro sent out a fax on 17 September styling himself as the chairman of PAP. Many other industry representatives
        <break page="4884" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         responded by saying that they would not work with Mr Munro and they rebelled.

        On 20 September, the day after, we had backdown No. 1 from the minister when he issued a press release stating that Mr James Kimpton from Ansett would now head the Program Advisory Panel. The minister stated in the press release:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have asked Mr Boyd Munro to chair the Regulatory Framework Advisory Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        A few days later, on 26 September, we had backdown No. 2 when Mr Munro was demoted from the main panel to be chair of one of the subsidiary panels. The press release stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Captain Bill Hamilton, the technical director of the Aircraft Owners' and Pilots' Association, will chair the Regulatory Framework Advisory Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        In effect, the minister had tried to impose his own  favourites, representing a relatively small part of the total aviation industry, onto the critical process of industry consultation with respect to the aviation safety regulatory review. The industry rebelled, and the minister was forced to make a humiliating backdown.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What does this tell the minister about what may happen if he does go ahead and appoints Dick Smith to the CASA board? What it should tell him is precisely what the opposition has been saying to him, that is, it will be a recipe for brawling within the organisation; it will be a recipe for major conflict and for the board becoming a battleground for competing factions within the industry; and, ultimately, very much not in the interests of aviation safety in Australia and not in the interests of passengers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I should hasten to add that the Program Advisory Panel process and the consultation
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         process is commendable. There is a good spread of industry representation. I note in particular one appointment to the panel that is commendable, although it is somewhat at odds with the minister's attitude to the CASA board, and that is the so-called consumer interest advocate, Mr John Laverick. Mr Laverick's daughter was a victim of the Seaview disaster and he has taken a very keen interest in these matters. I applaud his appointment; I think it is a very worthy appointment.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But it does give rise to a question. Mr Laverick's title is `consumer interest advocate'. As I recall, that is a title that Gabi Hollows on the board of CASA also carries. This question occurs in my mind: why is it that, in the quite technical and complex process of reviewing civil aviation safety regulations, it is appropriate to have a consumer advocate represented, but it is not appropriate to have a consumer advocate represented on the board in the more general process, which involves other issues aside from technical aviation issues such as administration of the organisation?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a core contradiction in the minister's position on aviation safety issues. He has taken a very strong position—and I think a commendable position—with respect to the disasters that have occurred and the fact that aviation safety regulation by the former Civil Aviation Authority was clearly at fault in that it should have been much more stringent, much less mindful of commercial interests and much more mindful of the interests of passengers and of the safety of the travelling public. But, in contrast to that, the minister has strongly identified himself with the very strongly deregulatory approach being pushed by Mr Smith and by AOPA as an organisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The significance of this is nowhere better seen than in the comments of the coroner in the Monarch inquiry, Mr Peter Gould, where he actually attributed a significant degree of responsibility for the lax administration of the Civil Aviation Authority to its former chairman, Mr Dick Smith, for the so-called pro customer approach or the slack regulatory approach that the CAA had taken. There is an
        <break page="4885" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         inherent contradiction in these positions, and at some point that contradiction is going to hit the minister in a very hard way. He is running with a deregulatory, affordable safety agenda pushing particular issues that ultimately will diminish the degree of aviation safety in this country, but at the same time he is making—appropriately—a strong play on issues such as the report we have before us today.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will conclude with a couple of references to the statement that the minister has made today on the detail of the report. He repeats his call for the board of CASA to resign. He notes that the non-executive board members have not, to the best of his knowledge, addressed any industry meetings or conferences, which is hardly the basis for condemnation. I think there is a question mark as to what extent that really is their role. He states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There is a need for strong leadership, and a knowledge and understanding of the industry by board members to enable them to keep ahead of the bureaucracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        That again raises the question: is it their role to second-guess technical advice or technical decisions made by the technical experts in CASA? I think not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister also implies that the board of CASA is somewhat to blame for the things which led to the Seaview and Monarch disasters. Quite clearly, it is not because it was not in place at the time when those disasters occurred. He then said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there are many fine and capable people within CASA who are desperately awaiting the right leadership and vision from the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, effectively implying that this is all the fault of the new board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. All the minister gives us, both on 25 June and today, as evidence in support of this is vague statements about the culture in the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and with no supporting evidence about what is currently occurring. There is no doubt that change is required and that change is occurring. I have full confidence in the CEO of CASA, Leroy Keith; I know the minister has confidence in him. Why he sees the board as such an obstacle to that process of change, I do not quite understand.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most extraordinary thing about all of this is that last week in the media we were promised that we were going to have the world's greatest aviation safety statement this week and that all sorts of incredible things were going to occur. Yet all we have had today from the minister is simply the recycled attack on the CASA board, which is entirely off the point, and the reiteration of the Program Advisory Panel process with respect to the regulatory review. That has already been announced and explained to this House.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is particularly peculiar in this response is that there is actually one very significant point of the Staunton recommendations with respect to the broader questions of aviation safety regulation, because the terms of reference were amended in about May 1995 requiring a much broader consideration of the general administration of aviation safety by the commission. Its response has been to recommend further inquiry on a whole range of issues with respect to aviation safety regulation including: the lax attitude to the importance of breaches of civil aviation safety regulations; the practices such as overstating of flying hours by pilots; the adequacy of pilot training; the significance of sole pilots being allowed to fly in spite of very limited experience; the adequacy of the maintenance release systems; and the structure of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we do have a recommendation which deserves some serious consideration, although there have been, as the minister mentioned, a number of inquiries, including the plane safe inquiry, that suggest that broader examination of these things is required. That also raises the question of why he can condemn the board of CASA—which was not in control and not in office at the time these disasters occurred—and what knowledge and what information he has on which to base his condemnation of that board and his cowboyish attempt to force them to resign over some months when his own inquiry, which he and I both commend, is saying that further examination is needed of these general questions about the future of civil aviation safety regulation and how CASA should operate.

       That this House censures the Treasurer for the embarrassment he caused Dr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, United States of America, by disclosing the contents of a confidential conversation on a highly sensitive matter; for the damage he has caused thereby to Australia's international reputation and credibility with senior decision makers; and for his subsequent persistent and deliberate attempts to mislead the public as to what he had done, in clear breach of his duty under the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is no wonder that the government has used its numbers today to delay the bringing on of this matter and to ensure that the debate commences in a relatively empty chamber. It is no wonder because the behaviour of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the United States last week has to be one of the most egregious and indefensible pieces of misbehaviour by an Australian minister in living memory.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       So much has been effectively admitted by the Treasurer today when in his first answer in question time, in his humble, chastised, pale and pasty mode that we last saw after the Premiers Conference debacle, he conceded that it had been inappropriate for him to comment on the subject matter of his discussion with Dr Greenspan and that it would not happen again. It was evident also in the Prime Minister's dash for cover in question time today, maintaining his record of effective silence on this matter that persisted through last week.
      </para>
      <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is the case that no parliament could possibly rest content with this matter without proceeding to a motion of this kind, because what we have seen in the last week has been extraordinarily highly censurable behaviour in at least three ways: first of all, in breaking faith with Dr Greenspan, an official of the utmost significance, on an issue of the utmost sensitivity in breach of all rules of protocol and practice in international discourse of this kind, in a way causing immense damage to our credit, our reputation, our credibility and our access to senior decision makers not only in the United States but elsewhere—a folly that was compounded, of course, by the failure to apologise to Dr Greenspan, if indeed there has been a failure to apologise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not surprising, I suppose, that the Treasurer ducked and weaved, as did the Prime Minister, on this issue today, because if there has not been an apology to Dr Greenspan that only compounds the offence already committed. And if there has been an apology, of course, it makes absolute nonsense of the campaign of denial that has been maintained right through the last week that nothing was done or said of any public damage to Australia that needed that sort of response.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second matter at issue here is the initial denial of the Treasurer that he had said anything at all on the subject of Dr Greenspan's views, dismissing any such report as fanciful. Thirdly, after the tape was played, making that defence inoperative, he embarked on the extraordinary course of denying that he said what the tape makes clear he said on at least two further major issues. We have seen a move in the last few days from an initial appalling indiscretion to an appalling exercise in dishonesty, combined with a further appalling exercise in dishonesty and untruthfulness based apparently on a deluded assumption of invulnerability that he could get away with it.

         Australian Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        front page article on 2 October, making it perfectly clear that the Treasurer was disclosing Dr Greenspan's views on a crucial issue
        <break page="4887" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         or series of issues relating to the setting of the United States interest rates. The impact of that
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         report was immediate. It was picked up by an AP&amp;hyphen;Dow Jones reporter. It was flashed around the world and resulted in an immediate surge, sustained over several days thereafter, in the international bond market. The impact was described, for example, by Mr Haralabopolous, the Chief Economist of GIO Australia, in these terms:

        Not only was this news in Australia, as Mr Costello tried to tell us, as reported on the AAP wires last week, but there was a flood of international responses to this disclosure. We were told that there was a flood of calls to Australia's Washington embassy by traders keen to confirm their accuracy. We are told by the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         International Herald Tribune
        </emphasis>
        that bond prices rose in direct response to those comments. We are told similar things by the Knight&amp;hyphen;Ridder report of that day. We are told that in a whole series of reports in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Wall Street Journal
        </emphasis>
        and other outlets, including the CNN web site, available internationally, which led with the brilliantly credible headline for Australia `Aussie gaffe stirs markets'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What was the reason that these comments, this report, had so much impact? The reason is not hard to discern. It is because the utterances of Dr Greenspan are watched as closely as those of the Pope. It is because, at the same time, Dr Greenspan is normally as inscrutable on these issues as the oracle of Delphi. He is in fact famous for a line that he uttered once to the United States Senate when he said to the senators, `If I have said something you can understand fully, then I probably made a mistake.' This is the way Dr Greenspan conducts himself in the public domain. He is not someone who believes in transparency; he is not someone who believes that it is appropriate for a central banker to lay out in the public domain every dimension of his current thinking on the issues that matter to his interest rate decision making.

         Under those circumstances it is an extraordinarily significant matter for Dr Green span's views to be put into the public domain in this way. That, Treasurer, is simply in international affairs what you don't do. When you come out of a meeting with a senior figure of this kind—

        It was not unexpected, as a result, that the reaction in the international sphere to this disclosure by the Treasurer was as severe as it was. The US Federal Reserve was very self&amp;hyphen;disciplined in its response. It maintained what was an icy&amp;hyphen;clear view by saying simply that the communication was a private matter and that Dr Greenspan did not comment on private meetings. They left it at that but the message was unmistakable and I do not think that anybody, even the Treasurer, mistook it.

        Others were less constrained in the way they expressed themselves. At question time I quoted from David Blitzer, the Chief Economist for Standard and Poor's, who was saying that this was `not the thing to do if he wants his telephone calls returned', and there would be `a huge storm if the United States Treasury Secretary had done anything like that'. We heard on the airwaves Mr Josh Fineman, the Global Markets Economist with Bankers Trust, saying:

Even Mr Kennett said, with the economy of expression for which he is sometimes famous, `The world now knows that Peter Costello is Treasurer of Australia.' And indeed they do! The editorials were absolutely devastating so far as the Treasurer was concerned. The

        In all of this we have seen a lot of speculation about the motives which might have led the Treasurer to go down this spectacular track, none more damning than the speculations of that person normally very sensitive to the role the coalition and the Treasurer play, Mr Michael Pascoe.

          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         on 4 October when he referred to `this disastrous bit of big noting'—by a Treasurer who cannot help himself. Whatever explanation there may be for this appalling indiscretion, whether it was big noting or whether it was just naivety, whether it was ignorance of the protocols that attend these meetings or whether it was anything else, there is no doubt about the damage that has been done to this man's credibility and to Australia's credibility and reputation in any dealings we may want to have with world leaders in the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then we moved from the indiscretion to the denial of it, the dishonesty. His first reaction was to describe the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         report as fanciful. It is all there, spelled out, in the Dow Jones report of 2 October. It said that Peter Costello had called `fanciful' reported remarks that were attributed to him and made about US monetary policy. Mr Costello, when the Federal Reserve confirmed that he had met with Mr Greenspan on Monday, repeated a number of times that such a report was fanciful. He said, `I don't comment on US interest rates,' and when read a portion of the text of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         report, he said, `That's fanciful.' That particular defence did not last long because a tape had been taken of the meeting and Mr Costello not many hours afterwards was comprehensively sprung with the tape recording of the exchange. Let me put it on the record. It went as follows:

         Then again the further denial that he was not saying anything about Dr Greenspan's views. He was simply recording his own assessment. Then again we had, as was put on record in question time today, the exact quotes from that particular initial media briefing making it absolutely clear that he was doing absolutely nothing of the kind. One denial, two denials, three denials. The cock is now crowing for you, sport, just as it did for your biblical namesake before you. Three strikes and you are out in baseball.

He built to the crescendo of his speech, which was the cheapest imitation of Lloyd Bentsen I have ever seen. Do you remember the Lloyd Bentsen put down: `Mr Senator, you are no John Kennedy'?

       But let us try to get to the crux of the argument, because it can be dealt with very quickly. The guts of the argument from the opposition is that on sensitive matters of monetary policy in the United States you should not talk. As I said earlier, if that were in fact your charge, why do you get up and invite further comments right throughout question time? Why would you, except to try to keep flogging a dead horse? As I said in question time, I readily accept that you can put various interpretations on comments, and

       I was over in the United States and I decided that I would keep a reality check on all of the press. On 2 October the thing that was thought to be important in the United States was the National Association of Purchasing Management, which reported that its competent index of manufacturing activity fell to 51.7 for September, a lower reading than many economists had anticipated. As was said in relation to that, the National Association of Purchasing Management index of manufacturing activity was expected to come in at 53. It fell to 51.7 in September from 52.6 in August. It was said that a reading above 50 often signals an expanding economy; a reading below 50 signals a contraction.

       After his last foray the Treasurer is `the loaded dog'.

      <para>
       Never could there be a more apt description. I urge the Victorian Premier to read this short story and see whether the description fits his view of the Treasurer. The dog in the story runs around creating mayhem all over the place—just as you did when you broke the confidentiality of Dr Greenspan's comment—and, at the end of it all, the story concludes:

You have not had the decency yet to apologise to Dr Greenspan. How are the posts overseas dealing with this circumstance? The fact is that Australia's reputation is diminished and you are responsible for doing it. This rests fairly on your shoulders and it has come about because of your arrogance and your cockiness. You are sneering at those who criticise, you are not prepared to face up to the responsibilities of office and, in the process, Australia suffers.

        —The only thing to come out of this pale imitation of a censure motion will be a renewed flurry of branch stacking in the seat of Holt, because the current occupant of that seat is on his way out. That was the poorest, most ordinary performance, on the most serious type of motion that can be moved in this chamber, by the member for Holt and Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). Talk about devaluing the censure—they have written it out of the proceedings of this place as a serious weapon of censure by the opposition.

        tactics—sadly, too much. But we never, at our worst moments, during our worst days, conducted a question time as they did. It was obvious that they ran out of questions. They could not even call for divisions. They lost the opportunity on two occasions to call for divisions—the most simple task that an opposition could possibly have. Then they did not even have a censure motion or a motion for the suspension of standing orders prepared. They were busily writing it out during the one and only division.

       They are a disorganised rabble, and that is reflected in their presentation of policy—as much as we know what it may be. We give them the opportunity to ask 10 questions a day during question time and they are still unable to prepare for it. They come in with only a handful of questions and wait until question No. 4 or No. 5—this very grave matter which must occupy the time of the national parliament—to ask the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about this incident. That is how seriously they take it.

       There are some winners from the extraordinarily poor performance of the member for Holt today. Firstly, there is the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin). I do not know whether anybody noticed him sitting back there, but I did, because he is the next member for Holt. He wants to shift from the seat of Bruce, which is marginal and very likely—if I might be slightly overconfident, certain—to fall to the Liberal Party at the next election. As far as he is concerned, the member for Holt, former Senator Evans, cheated him out of the seat of Holt when his seat of Corinella was abolished in a redistribution in Victoria prior to the last election. He is grinning very broadly.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The other winner, of course, is the member for Hotham, the aspirant for the deputy leadership of the opposition and, soon after,
       <break page="4897" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        the leadership of the opposition. He is the next shadow Treasurer; of that there is no doubt. He has all the bluster, the bluff and the overconfidence reminiscent of Paul Keating; not the shadow Treasurer. He should receive the accolade of being a Keating impersonator. So there is no doubt there will be a fundamental realignment in the leadership of the other side before very much longer. It is obviously reflected in their performances in the chamber.

       One cannot help wondering, given their inept tactics, so blatantly incompetent, whether or not the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham, with his designs on the shadow treasurership and eventually on the leadership of the opposition, is running dead. Is this all part of his grand plan to embarrass the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? If it is not, he is still achieving his same objective.

       Perhaps it was similar to a problem he had when he visited Berlin in 1989 when he decided to detour to a monument on his way to the airport. He got caught in a traffic jam which threatened to make him miss his plane. He leapt out of his Mercedes, strode down to the vehicle carrying his staff, which was caught two cars behind, and roundly abused the uncomprehending German driver for not keeping up. The list goes on. He might like to advise the House what he said to a Pakistani television crew in 1990 when they asked him for a comment after he arrived at Lahore airport—at the end, admittedly, of a long, hard day. There was similar sort of language, an obscenity and a blasphemous comment, to what he said to the South African guard.

       His performance on the international stage is something for us to be genuinely embarrassed about instead of this completely false charge against the Treasurer. Has anybody mentioned this to you out in the electorate in the last week or so as you have been wandering around? How out of touch does the Labor Party have to get before they finally wake up and realise what the concerns and expectations of the Australian people really are? They do not relate in any shape or form to the US bond rate. They relate to the issues we are tackling as a government on a day-to-day basis: economic growth, micro-economic reform, industrial relations reform and the like, all of which have been blocked in the Senate.

       Who is doing that? Who is reducing, eliminating, the budget deficit over three years as demanded by the shadow Treasurer? The government, of course. Who is frustrating us and blocking us in the Senate? To a large extent, the Labor Party. The day after the budget, the shadow Treasurer again repeated the gist of those remarks when he said on the Peter Couchman program on 3LO:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The budget deficits were getting too big again, they had to be brought back, but that was a medium term task that we believed could have been accomplished with infinitely less pain over a three year period.

       He said this only 24 hours before the government had delivered its budget achieving exactly the target the shadow Treasurer was setting for his own side of politics and for the government of the day. What credibility does he have? No wonder there is a complete

       That is what you would expect from somebody with relevance deprivation syndrome. He has run up the white flag. Everybody knows it. His branches know it; they are being stacked. The member for Bruce knows it. The member for Hotham hopes it to be true and will encourage it in whatever way he can. He was a senior cabinet minister for 13 years and within weeks of going into opposition he caved in. So much for his commitment to the Labor cause. How does he explain his timidity, his failures to engage in public policy debate in this country to the grassroots, the rank and file of the Labor Party? They have been good to him—very good. He swanned all over the world on 120 to 150 overseas trips, whatever it was, on government business, of course. He owes the Labor Party, but he does not address their fundamental concerns, let alone their hopes and aspirations for the future. He comes into this place with trumped up charges against the Treasurer who was able to do in his first budget what no Treasurer since John Howard in the Fraser administration was able to do.

       For all the bluff, bluster, exaggeration and overblown rhetoric of the member for Hotham, the fact is that this is a nonsense censure motion moved so early in the life of the opposition as to render all following censure motions irrelevant and meaningless. This opposition are desperate. They completely bungled question time. They think they have a minister on the ropes. We come in expecting the Labor Party to show their full strength, their full political wit and have some idea of their strategic ambitions. Instead, we got meandering questions from a former senator who is still unable to reduce his questions to 50 words. We are still getting these one minute or 1&amp;half;&amp;hyphen;minute questions which are self-answering or even rhetorical. In any event, they are totally ineffective. It makes you laugh.

That attacks the fundamental basis on which the Main Committee was established—namely, that it would deal with non-controversial matters. Embedded in standing orders 270 and 276 is the fact that one voice is sufficient to send the matter back from the Main Committee to the House.

       A couple of years ago, in 1994, members of this House established the Main Committee for particular and limited purposes, quite clearly, on the basis of recommendations made expressly by the Procedure Committee which were clearly adopted by this House when it received the report and when it adopted the standing orders.

       To avoid unproductive consideration of controversial bills in the Main Committee and to minimise time being taken up at the report stage in the House, the guiding principle for the selection of bills should be that only bills on which there is potential for agreement to be reached should be referred to the Main Committee.

       The House so embraced that comment from the member for Watson that they immediately gave him an extension of time. When the then Prime Minister came to the House in February 1994 and presented the then government's suggested changes to the standing orders to effect the Main Committee, after the appropriate procedures had been gone through, the Procedure Committee doing a report and the presentation of the Procedure Committee report to the parliament, the then Prime Minister in presenting the report said in respect of the Main Committee:

       He went on to say:

       In respect of the Main Committee he went on to say:

       Our attitude is basically to give it a go.

       But to give what a go? To establish a subservient committee, the Main Committee, which would deal with non&amp;hyphen;controversial matters.
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        How did the standing orders embed that principle? The standing orders embedded that principle by the first proviso, standing order 270, and then by standing order 276. Standing order 270, the first proviso, says:
       </break>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Provided that a bill or other order of the day may be returned to the House for consideration at any time during its consideration in the Main Committee by agreement to a motion which may be moved without notice by any Member (no seconder required) "That further proceedings be conducted in the House" which motion shall be determined without amendment or debate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Standing order 276 goes on to say:
      </para>

       Every question in the Committee shall be decided on the voices and if any Member dissents from the result announced by the Chair, the question shall be recorded in the minutes as unresolved.
      </para>
      <para>
       So what did the House have in mind when it established the Main Committee? The House had in mind a chamber that would deal with non&amp;hyphen;controversial matters, in which one voice—one member—could move the motion and, by the recording of that voice, have the matter sent back here. Why? It was because the parliament only ever intended that the Main Committee deal with matters that every member of this parliament regarded as non&amp;hyphen;contentious, that every member of this parliament conceded, agreed and thought it was appropriate to send to the Main Committee to debate and discuss it, to free up time in the House for other, generally controversial matters.

       </break>
      </para>
      <para>
       In its subsequent paragraph the committee said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The committee does not propose any change to the standing orders to increase the range of business referred to the Main Committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why? It was because everyone believed that the Main Committee was acting and operating appropriately. The submission presented to the Procedure Committee by the then opposition manager of business, the now Leader of the House, did not even refer to the Main Committee, such was the general satisfaction with and acceptance of the basis upon which the Main Committee had been established.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       How was that process of dealing with non&amp;hyphen;controversial matters, items on which every member of this chamber agreed, embedded? It was embedded in the capacity of one voice, one member—one voice of conscience or one voice of dissent—to go to the Main Committee and refer the matter back here because a conscience view of a member of parliament dictated that it was not appropriate to be conducted in the Main Committee, as he or she took the view that it was a controversial matter. How does the motion by the Leader of the House by way of suspension seek to attack that? Paragraph (5) says:

       What is the sleight of hand? It is to override the clear and precise intent of the first proviso of standing order 270, combined with standing order 276. If you want to override, attack, destroy and undermine the entire basis upon which the Main Committee rests, if you want to destroy or seek to destroy the foundation upon which the Main Committee rests, you cannot come into this House in respect of one particular bill and try to do it by sleight of hand. If you want to do that you must come into this House and move a substantive motion by way of amendment to standing orders to change the basis upon which the Main Committee is constituted.

       If the House believes that this paragraph is not out of order then what can the Leader of the House come to this chamber tomorrow and seek to do in precisely the same way? We might discover that the convenience of the Leader of the House sees a motion to suspend

       The fact of the matter is that section 1 of the constitution says:

       The Main Committee was initially set up as an experiment by the House of Representatives to facilitate efficiencies in the way it undertook its business.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The member for Perth referred to a number of extracts not only of speeches of Dr Blewett and the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) but other sources. I refer, for instance, to a speech delivered on 6 February 1994 by the then Prime Minister when foreshadowing the Procedure Committee report. He said:

       The procedure committee report dealt with three main areas:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       . first, the handling of legislation—particularly the need to free up chamber time for proposed consideration of legislation by providing a main committee or second chamber, for handling routine and uncontroversial bills.
      </para>
      <para>
       In no way could the euthanasia bill be regarded as routine and uncontroversial. We have all been inundated with correspondence indicating the intensity of debate in the community

        on that proposed legislation. It is perhaps one of the most controversial and intensely felt proposals that I have seen in this parliament not only in my very limited lifespan here but also from my immediate recollection.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In addition, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the member for Swan at that stage, in presenting amendments to the standing orders, again stressed the fundamental premise when on 10 February 1994 he said in respect of the amendments regarding the Main Committee:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       make it as simple as possible, with a quorum effectively requiring in place only a chairperson, one government member and one non&amp;hyphen;government member.
      </para>
      <para>
       He noted that the use of that description was deliberate. I will say something about the quorum requirements presently. He also said:
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       If the main committee is to work as envisaged by the Blewett committee and by the government, it ought to have before it legislation which is effectively non&amp;hyphen;controversial but which does require a bit of detailed attention from the House, in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Again, I trust there will be cooperation in the debate on the euthanasia legislation but that debate will be very intense.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       To continue to underline the significance of the point that I am making, in addition to those examples referred to by the member for Perth, I refer to comments by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) when, on 10 February, he said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We are worried about the proposal for a main committee. This could mean a further reduction of the importance of the role of the House of Representatives in the government of this country.

      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
       Unfortunately, despite assertions that the government is here to restore or foster representative democracy, its actions do not match its words. This is a classic example of where the government will be demeaning the significance of the House of Representatives, which we are all in now, that is connected to the Australian public by way of media networks and of course by virtue of the Australian public being able to come in here and sit in the galleries. The main chamber simply will not access the Australian public or, stated in reverse and more correctly, the Australian
       <break page="4906" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        public will be shut out of this debate if it is referred to the Main Committee.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I underline the point even further by referring to a comment made by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he was in opposition. He made the comment with respect to the Blewett committee proposals on a radio broadcast on 3 June 1994. With respect to the Main Committee, he said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       My approach is very much trial and error, wait and see. We agreed in principle with a second Chamber; we are prepared to cooperate with the Government to try and make it work. If it does work, then that's good. If it does allow for more intense debate in the main Chamber, if it means that the major issues are debated in the main Chamber, if it results in a higher quality of debate in the main Chamber, that's better.
      </para>
      <para>
       The motion proposing to send the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee does precisely the opposite. It does not allow for the more intense debate in the main chamber. It literally is shunting the debate off. I, for one, have not as yet formulated my views as to how I will vote on the euthanasia legislation. I certainly want to pay very careful attention to that debate and it simply will not be possible if I have other matters to attend to here in the House of Representatives. These are matters which were considered quite clearly when the Main Committee was established through the standing orders.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In addition to paragraph (5) of the motion, which was referred to by the member for Perth, clearly the thrust of what the government has in mind is also underlined by paragraph (4), which purports to amend the quorum requirements which are set out in standing order 272.

         ate mechanisms and debate. For instance, standing order 272 provides that the quorum of the Main Committee is three—being the chair, one government member and one opposition member. Paragraph (4) of the motion seeks to, in a backdoor fashion, amend that by saying that the quorum is three, certainly, but of the chair and two members; there does not have to be an opposition member.
        </break>
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Clearly the purpose of the original requirement would have enabled the opposition to, aside from relying upon standing orders 270 and 276, ensure the debate returned to the House; it could simply have abolished the quorum by leaving the Main Committee. That will no longer be possible as a result of paragraph (4) of the motion. As mentioned, this is in addition to what is being proposed in paragraph (5).
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The unworkability of paragraph (5) is clear on its face. The member for Perth indicated that there is a possibility that the Main Committee may continue to sit even when the House does not sit. On one argument, paragraph (5) would require that to occur, because it says that the Main Committee continues debate on the bill regardless of any unresolved questions. Arguably, that is a direction to the Main Committee to continue sitting whatever. In that context, it is again clearly contrary to the purpose of the standing orders and, for that reason, out of order.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I refer, Mr Deputy Speaker, to standing order 274, which enables the chairman of the committee to suspend the committee to enable a member to attend a division. Paragraph (5) arguably would preclude that occurring, because it is a direction to continue rolling on in the Main Committee come what may. In standing order 282, if any sudden disorder arises in the Main Committee, the chair may on motion without notice by any member forthwith suspend the sitting and shall report the disorder to the House.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Arguably, again, paragraph (5) of the motion deprives the chair of that opportunity or means of enforcing discipline because paragraph (5) can quite clearly be construed as being a direction to the Main Committee to continue the debate come what may.
       <break page="4907" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        Indeed, one infers that is the intention of the motion, because the government does not want debate in the Main Committee interrupted as a result of any action by the opposition. So, for these reasons, the motion proposed by the manager of government business is out of order.

       As was indicated in comments by the then opposition members, now government members, they were very concerned that the establishment of the Main Committee might diminish both the standing of the House of Representatives and the substance of debate proceeding in the House of Representatives. That clearly is the convention which was developed in the establishment of the Main Committee, that convention being that the Main Committee is only to deal with uncontroversial matters which were referred to it with the consent of both parties. Indeed, as the member for Perth rightly pointed out, standing orders 270 and 276 ensure that to be the case.

       The point I was making was that this is a private member's bill. In the normal course of events, the opportunities for members to debate a private member's bill are very limited indeed. Under those circumstances, and given that this is a matter of national debate and interest to many people, the government felt that it was appropriate that there be time provided for any member to speak on the issue. To facilitate giving members this opportunity to speak, the government's proposal is that the matters be first discussed and debated in the chamber for an hour and a half with three speakers a side. From the government side there would be essentially the mover of the motion, a second member who would presumably speak against the motion and the third member being the member for Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), having a specific interest on behalf of his constituency. Likewise we would expect the opposition to be able to put together three speakers who would canvass the issue. The issue would then be referred to the Main Committee.

       We understand that something like 45 members have indicated their intention to speak. I dare say that, as the debate is undertaken, there may well be more who wish to speak. The government in this budget session has a series of legislative proposals for which it has a mandate from the Australian people. We have tried to essentially compromise the government's legislative program with the right of members to speak on this issue. There has been a lot of airing of views about the Main Committee, and I refer specifically to the fifth part of my procedural motion. Those views have suggested that, being the second chamber, only secondary bills are dealt with there and that debate in the Main Committee does not enjoy the same visibility as debate in this chamber.

        The Main Committee has come a long way since its inception under the previous government in 1994. There has been bipartisan cooperation in maximising the benefits of the second chamber in a sensible, constructive manner. Very important bills are dealt with in the Main Committee, including the annual appropriation bills which were first referred to the Main Committee in 1995 under the former Labor government. Indeed, the appropriation bills for 1996-97 are at the present time being considered in the Main Committee, allowing the many members who wish to speak the full opportunity to do so. Honourable members would appreciate that, from the government's point of view, the first coalition budget in 13 years is a rather significant issue.

        This procedural motion will allow the government to program the debate subject to the demands of its legislative program. Let us not lose sight of the reality that it is a private member's bill, which, under normal circumstances, could not expect to receive an airing such as is proposed by this motion. Moreover, the private member's business selection committee did not allocate any time for the second reading debate on the euthanasia bill, and accordingly without the passage of this motion the bill would not be debated at all. Accordingly, this motion facilitates rather than restricts debate on the bill.

        I make the point that this is providing people with an opportunity to be heard that they would not otherwise have had. It is private member's business, not government business. We are not restricting debate. We are allowing debate. We are providing for debate. The Prime Minister made it very clear in his public statements that, on an issue of national importance, raising the very grave issues that this legislation does, members are entitled, and the public at large would expect the parliament, to address the issues regardless of the differing points of view that people may have.

        We did encourage the proponent of the bill to seek agreement and there was some agreement. That agreement is not now forthcoming and, under those circumstances, the government has taken the view that to discharge its obligations and the commitments it gave it was necessary to set up a procedural motion to protect the right of members to so speak. That is simply all that we are doing. We are providing 10 minutes per speaker. Again, that was discussed at the time with the opposition members. It is consistent with the time provided generally for second reading debate of private members' bills during private members business time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The motion also varies the quorum arrangements for debate on the bill to require the presence of the chair and two members and, in so doing, it drops the normal requirement for one government member and one non&amp;hyphen;government member to be part of a quorum.

        However, that is not the issue at the core of my ruling. The question is whether or not it is competent for this House to seek to suspend the standing orders which this House itself put in place for the operation of that committee. It would seem to me that standing orders 399 to 401 make it abundantly clear that the House does have the capacity to amend or suspend its standing orders for the operation of that House if it chooses to do so. Whether or not that is wise is a matter for debate by the House, but my ruling is that it is competent for the House to decide whether or not it wishes to suspend standing orders. That is the reason I have made that ruling. Having made that comment, I will accept the motion of the Leader of the House. The question is that the question be now put.

         —There has been no more dishonourable assault than this on the integrity and processes of this House in the nine years in which I have been a member, and I suspect in the memories of all members of this House. Let me say to members that not only do we believe that this would have been an offence against the standing orders—a matter which has been resolved by the vote—but also, in my mind,
         <break page="4913" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          there is a very significant constitutional question of whether the processes that are proposed for adoption will take this matter beyond the legitimate capacity of this parliament to legislate.

        Section 40 of the constitution of Australia provides that questions arising in this House shall be determined by a majority of votes. The process that has been proposed by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is that the Main Committee debate shall continue regardless of any unresolved questions. That means that in that place, which purports to be this parliament in action, there will be no votes. A parliament which has no votes is not a democracy. It is not a parliament under this constitution. So we have a full frontal attack on one of the fundamental tenets that this House is obliged to uphold by the prime law of this country—the constitution of Australia. The dignity and respect of members is so undermined that I believe that each and every member of this House ought regard this with abhorrence.

        We have heard some people suggest that this is a convenient way of dealing with a controversial measure. What absolute nonsense! This is one of the most significant and controversial measures ever put before the parliament. What about the attempt to make a distinction in this debate between matters that are brought forward by private members and by government?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have the government saying that they will give priority in this parliament to their legislative program and, because this is merely a private member's matter, it will be shoved into a back room with no attention, with a quorum that has been reduced to three to hear debate on one of the most contentious bills that has ever been before this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not unique that private members bring in controversial bills. McKenzie&amp;hyphen;Lamb brought in the Family Law Bill. That private member's bill again divided members not on any basis of party line. That debate was had in the House and in the Senate. It was not shoved off to some room where the people of Australia are excluded. Most importantly, it was not put off to an environment where the concerns and wishes of members participating
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         in a debate count for nought. If it is lawful for this parliament to suspend the right to vote in a parliamentary debate, it is lawful in this parliament by a simple majority, through a government member, to exclude any debate on any issue of substance.

        What more contemptible process could emerge? The second chamber was established in such a way as to make sure the power of this House was not removed. There can be discussion in that chamber, but whenever a controversial matter arises it must be brought back to this House so the House can vote on it. That is to be overturned. This parliament has had plenty of opportunities in the past to debate controversial matters brought forward by private members. What is this case of necessity that is to be made out?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Is there any urgency facing the government's business? Let us look realistically at the government's legislative program in the Senate. The Senate has before it some 61 packages of legislation which the government seeks to give priority to. There are 25 budget and 36 non-budget related measures. Even with the cooperation which has been extended by the opposition in an unprecedented way—that is, allowing two extra weeks of debate in the Senate—and forgoing all the rules that the previous opposition insisted upon in relation to allowing debate in the same session of parliament, there is no realistic prospect of these measures coming before the parliament.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Would that chamber treat its members with the same contempt that the Leader of the House is proposing to treat members of this House with—that is, to suggest that members of that chamber would not be heard by their colleagues in this debate? This is one of those rare debates in Australian political history where I believe at least a substantial number of members of this parliament would be interested in following the debate.

         Most of the debates in this place are set piece debates. We know the outcomes. The government proposes legislation and its members are bound by a caucus. The Labor Party also binds its members by a caucus. The outcomes of those debates are predetermined. With the difference in numbers between the parties, the Independents will have no signifi cance in terms of the outcome. There may be an element of theatre in the debate, but for practical purposes we know the outcome before the debate starts.

        That is not the case with this legislation. I have no idea how this debate will emerge and who will vote for what position. I believe there are a number of members—and I have spoken to a number of them myself—who are waiting to see how this debate emerges before they determine their views. How can they do that in this situation? This afternoon I went to the Main Committee during the censure debate in this chamber. In cooperation with the government we permitted debate on the appropriation bills to move to that place. We did that for the convenience of the government. Not one member objected to that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The quorum for that chamber is three. When I was in that chamber there was not a quorum. There was no government member there. They adjourned for 10 minutes and then I had the respectable audience of three. The whole focus of that chamber is, as every member knows, to euthanase debates, to bury debates, to put them into the darkest recesses. Why can you do that? You can do that because it is convenient for the House. Not one member dissents from that idea.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second chamber was introduced in a climate of some concern for the then opposition. The then opposition said that we must be wary lest this be abused. What an irony that the abuse has been brought on by the Leader of the House. What an irony it is that the opposition has allowed its members a conscience vote not only on the substance of the matter but also on all matters associated with it—procedural and otherwise. It is ironic that the government still insists on holding a caucus over its members when it seeks to rort this institution and undermine the fabric and foundation of this institution.

But how will I hear that; how will I know that; how will there be any colour to this debate; and how will it matter to the Australian people?

        This is a matter which both sides regard and recognise as being of fundamental importance. It is truly a matter of life and death. What are we seeing? We are seeing debates on the flags bill and other trivial matters, which are of no significance in the national interest, being proceeded with in a farcical way in the House while this contentious and controversial bill is removed from the spotlight of public attention. This will take away the capacity for members to play a responsible part in parliamentary debate, to listen to what their colleagues say and to take part in one of the few debates that will actually be conducted seriously and in which every member will be examining their conscience, making decisions on and speaking according to their hearts.

        The one issue on which the Australian people wish to see their members responsibly living up to the charter that they have imposed on them by giving them their trust as members of this parliament is going to be shunted off and subsumed in an environment where there is no adequate reporting of those debates and where the normal coverage of this House simply is not available. This offends against every convention.

The sponsors of this legislation must now know—my having referred to this now—that there is at least more than an arguable case that, even if this legislation passes, it is subject to constitutional challenge.

        Those people on that side who are lining up to say that they are interested in a conscientious vote on conscientious grounds but who are supporting this repellent abuse—this precedent—that diminishes the rights of individual members of parliament are going to find themselves actually diminishing their capacity and putting at risk the very legislation they are sponsoring. I am appalled by this and believe that it is one of the most fundamental abuses that has occurred. As an individual member of this parliament, I have always taken a great sense of responsibility for my contributions—good or bad. However, because I am not one of the principal protagonists in this debate, I will participate in it in the secrecy and the confines of the Main Committee room, in an environment where those matters are not subject to vote and where democracy has been excluded.

        My reaction to much of the substance of the speech by the member for Denison was that he must never have been in the Main Committee. I am reminded that he went up this afternoon. The member for Denison was horrified to find that you have to have a quorum of three in the Main Committee. In fact, the Main Committee is one step ahead of this chamber in that sense, because if there is not a quorum of three in the Main Committee and if that quorum does not include at least one government member and one opposition member then it is automatically suspended.

        The reason that this motion is framed so that other divisions cannot be raised up in the Main Committee is to give people full opportunity to debate the bill. It is to facilitate the bill. It is so that people cannot wantonly and mischievously keep on aborting the debate up in the Main Committee. There were good reasons for putting into the initial standing orders what went in in relation to the Main Committee. We have had a bit of experience of the Main Committee since then, and not as much goodwill has reigned at all times as we might have hoped. On the whole, it has been fairly successful.

        The member for Denison picks out one, the Flags Bill, and refers to it with derision. We will remind the member for Denison what he said tonight about the Flags Amendment Bill when we are debating that bill. We will remind him of his derisory attitude tonight towards that bill. The simple fact is that the budget and the government's legislation must go through this chamber in good time, this session. A large amount of it must be dealt with also by the Senate in good time. That is the government program.

        We are talking about the precedence that is being given to a private member's bill and whether its debate should be in this chamber. The government has the House of Representatives sitting for an extra week, over and above the program we already had, to enable us to get through the budget session legislation. The government is the government; it is going to get its legislative program through—and it must, logically, give precedence to its own program over a private member's bill. But it is not shuffling the private member's bill out of sight. It is not saying, `We won't give it time.' There would be no sittings of the Main Committee to debate this bill if the government did not want the Main Committee to sit to debate it. The government is making provision to enable us to have all of those debates, including what would normally have the lowest precedence, that is, a private member's bill.

          —Welcome to the standing orders of the House of Representatives. If you did a comparison of the amount of legislation before parliament and the number of members of parliament then, you would get an indication of how those bills got debating time. Not only that, you should also do a comparison—if you are going to start comparing our parliament with parliaments of 20 years ago—of the use of the guillotine. The big argument in favour of the Main Committee was that we hoped it would do away with the need to use the guillotine, so that members could get to debate all the bills they wanted to and have the due amount of time.

         There are still times when the program comes under pressure at the end of the session where we may voluntarily agree to reduce the length of our speeches from, let us say, the 20 minutes we are entitled to under the standing orders to approximately 10 minutes. These things are done by agreement. But the fact is that if you go back and look at how many bills were guillotined under the previous government, particularly in previous parliaments—

         —The fairness of the coalition government's family tax initiative was brought home in today's release of a report from Gillian Beer of the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. I referred to the centre's director, Ann Harding, in my earlier contribution, reflecting on the conclusions of some of her earlier work that families were far more vulnerable under the previous Labor government and that a far greater proportion of families were ending up in poverty statistics.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The centre's Ms Beer found that lower income families will gain the highest percentage increases in income and most of the benefits from the family tax initiative, with 40 per cent of the benefits going to families in the bottom 30 per cent of the family income distribution. In other words, the coalition's `cash for kids' measure favours the families in `Dunkley by the bay' who need it most. Ms Beer points out that well over half of the $1 billion worth of spending on the family tax initiative will be received by families with taxable incomes of less than $38,700 a year. A majority of families in `Dunkley by the bay' earn below this figure.

        Clearly the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) is a little upset about how apparently good this family tax measure is for average families in Australia and he does not like to hear about it. So I will just commend to him the report from the University of Canberra. Perhaps it is very good reading for the member for Isaacs.

        I guess the interesting contrast is how we are making solid ground on improving the tax situation for Dunkley's families while those opposite are slipping and sliding around. It is clear from what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said today that half of Labor's frontbench either have a favourite new tax or a tax they would like to increase. The interesting contrast is that the coalition is helping families in Dunkley while Labor still thinks it knows best how to spend the income that is available to Dunkley's families.

         —The government today have been trumpeting the fact that the two family tax initiative bills before the House underpin their initiatives to assist the lot of the Australian family. Of course, the coalition made great play during the election campaign of the wondrous things they would do for the family, including the families of Dunkley, and of course those in the neighbouring electorate of Isaacs. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) explained in his second reading speech, these bills will—according to him—give effect to the centrepiece of the government's election commitment to Australian families, that being the so&amp;hyphen;called family tax initiative.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am sure the Treasurer deliberately used the word `centrepiece' because there are a few other initiatives affecting families which spring from the government's budget for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would rather that we and the Australian populous at large did not focus on, which goes to prove, as I am sure any magician will tell you, that this is nothing more than a great conjuring trick, a great magic trick, shamelessly perpetrated upon the Australian electorate.

         As we address the bills this evening, in which the government appears to be giving something to Australian families with one hand, the debate on this year's appropriation bills in the Main Committee clearly demonstrates that it is taking away from Australian families with the other hand, with some glee. I quote from the Treasurer's second reading speech:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The government recognises that providing an economic and social environment in which families can achieve their full potential is crucial to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society.
        </para>
        <para>
         Further, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Providing financial assistance to those families with the greatest need is an investment in that economic and social environment.
        </para>
        <para>
         I am sure those are fine sentiments—there is a lot of glib rhetoric such as we heard today from the Treasurer in question time—and I can assure the House that whenever the government genuinely seeks to improve the lot of the Australian family it will always receive the wholehearted support of the opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These bills propose measures to recognise the cost of raising dependent children through the income tax system. But many of my colleagues who have spoken today have pointed out in some detail that only a very small proportion of Australian families will benefit at all from the measures which the government proposes. There are many deserving families and hard working Australian families who live in areas such as Frankston North in Dunkley who will miss out on any so&amp;hyphen;called family tax initiatives altogether.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) so lucidly pointed out earlier in his contribution to this debate, when closer scrutiny is paid to the figures in this year's budget, it becomes clear that the $147 million allocated for the family tax initiative is far more than offset by the massive increase in general taxation revenue for that financial year. Of course, individuals will pay some $5.5 billion more in tax in this financial year, of which $1.8 billion can be attributed to bracket creep—meaning that for every dollar received by the government through the family tax
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          initiative almost $13 is removed through that insidious process called bracket creep. This is yet another of the government's nifty conjuring tricks.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This side of the House has always been happy to support any measures under which families are better off, but the measures that are outlined in this document cannot be considered in isolation. The Treasurer also said in his second reading speech:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The family tax initiative is a clear example of the government's commitment to giving families greater choice—

         I emphasise those words `greater choice'—

        <para font-size="-=2">
         and in how they juggle work and family responsibilities.
        </para>
        <para>
         He went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Each family is the best judge of what it needs, and the government's program of reforms reflects that approach.
        </para>
        <para>
         When you consider that amongst the government's program of reforms which the Treasurer referred to are increases in HECS fees, an increase in charges for pharmaceuticals, the downgrading of the public health system, reduction of funding for legal aid, the scrapping of most labour market programs, cuts to child care and, in particular, the abolition of a large part of the dental health program, which had such a significant impact upon working men and women in Dunkley, only then can you begin to understand exactly what the Treasurer meant when he referred to giving families greater choice. That is what he said: he referred to giving families `greater choice in how they spend their hard&amp;hyphen;earned cash'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Treasurer referred to choices for Australian families, but the choice is to pay more for a whole range of basic services or to go without. That is the choice they are faced with. I am sure that is not the choice he was referring to in that budget speech but that is the choice that many people are faced with. The truth of the matter is that families, even those who may gain some financial benefit from the tax measures in these bills, will
         <break page="4924" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          receive no choice at all. As I have alluded to, many will miss out on basic necessities of life—and I cite dental health care and the opportunities for further education for their children.

         The words of the Treasurer in his second reading speech provide evidence that the coalition government's so&amp;hyphen;called family policy stems not from the homes, the workplaces, the communities or the lives of ordinary Australians but rather these sentiments find their genesis in the driest of the dry economic rationalist textbooks and theories.

         In my electorate of Isaacs we have the suburb of Cranbourne. As I said in this place before, it is part of the city of Casey, the fastest growing municipality in Australia, and could be described as being fairly typical of middle, rapidly growing Australia. The government would have us and the good people of Cranbourne believe that the tax and other initiatives that the Treasurer referred to during his second reading speech are aimed fairly and squarely at those Cranbourne residents and that they will be so much better off because of them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us look at some fairly objective and fairly informed local commentary to see what prospects these reforms hold for the people of Cranbourne. I can do no better than quote the district commander of the Salvation Army, Envoy Derek Linsell, who on 5 October last year hosted the then Leader of the Opposition on a tour of Salvation Army facilities in Cranbourne.

         We can see some very worrying signs. The member for Paterson might not be able to see those worrying signs but on our side of the House we can see them. We realise that we will always have poor people. We acknowledge that. There will always be people who are worse off than others, but the beauty of Australia in the last 10 or 15 years has been that we, Labor, put a safety net in place. That is the answer to your question. The danger right now is that that same safety net will disappear.

         In conclusion, we do not appreciate the disingenuous nature of the government's rhetoric in its support for the family, particularly when in its first budget it has made the lot of the average Australian family so much more difficult. It will not take long for Australian families, as has been demonstrated in a recent by&amp;hyphen;election in Queensland, to see through the government's charade, once they become aware of the government's lack of understanding and compassion for their needs and their struggles. I commend the bill and the amendment by the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) to the House.

        I am speaking tonight, of course, of the family. This government has recognised the pre&amp;hyphen;eminent place of the family unit in Australian society. While the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) might have been giving the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) a bit of a rough time, I was quite surprised that the member for Isaacs was 14 minutes into his address before he mentioned the two bills—the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill.

        It seems to me that he wanted to skirt the key issue, and that is that some real and genuine aid has been delivered to the middle and low income families of Australia. This government has recognised that the family is the core social unit of our society and has made it a priority to relieve the financial pressure on low and middle income families bringing up children.

        This government has recognised that just because hardworking average Australian couples with their 2.3 children, their mortgage, their school books, their school uniforms, their car repayments, their registration and the food on their table do not jump up and down and make a lot of noise does not mean that they do not deserve to be this government's No. 1 priority. This government has made them their No. 1 priority. We articulated that in our headland speeches. We articulated that in our election promises. In this measure we have delivered.

         We have delivered to them a family package that will put extra money in their pockets in real terms. More than that, this government has delivered a tax package which will reach families who need that money most. Before I outline the measures and initiatives which the government will deliver to families, let me take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on a short trip down memory lane to the time when the Labor Party—the party supposedly with a reputation for representing the battlers of this country—turned their backs on those average parents of whom I speak, those same families of Australia. As painful as it might be for those opposite to listen to this, just bear with me for a moment.

         What happened under Labor? Under Labor, household debt rose over $200 million or an equivalent of nearly 70 per cent of household disposable income. Under Labor, home loan repayments rose to 27 per cent of medium monthly family income, up from just 19 per cent under the Fraser government in 1983. Under Labor, sales tax revenue rose from $9.2 billion in 1992-93, the year before the Keating government took office or the last term of the Keating government, to $12.95 billion in 1995-96. That is a staggering increase of 40 per cent over the full three years of the last term of the Keating government.

I would have thought the $1.8 billion would have applied broadly across the whole spectrum of government initiatives. But, if we take up that $1.8 billion, what about this measure here—and that was just one aspect of Labor taxation—that over a short time took $3.7 billion from the Australian battlers?

          —Under Labor, the PAYE taxes for small business were increased to bimonthly payments. In 1993, the Keating government delivered tax cuts with the greatest proportion of savings to people earning $50,000 per year—a figure which at the time was 67 per cent higher than average weekly earnings. As Ross Gittens so aptly put it in the

          As I was saying, in quoting Mr Ross Gittens at the time, Labor's philosophy seemed to be to aim those cuts at the top end of the middle range. During this period, the lower middle income earner has been the most disadvantaged. As recently as the 1995 budget the best Labor could do for families was a $4 increase in the guardian allowance for sole parents, a $5 increase in rent assistance and some vague reference to `measures to help families in crisis and through difficult times', as the

          I suppose you could say that this legacy of Labor has been a pretty sorry tale. It has shown that the previous government had no soul. In contrast the current government does have a soul. It is looking to the bread and butter issues that Labor so wilfully neglected. Is it any wonder then that at the last election the blue&amp;hyphen;collar workers deserted the Labor Party in droves? Is it any wonder when the Labor Party had deserted the battlers trying to make an honest living and raise a family? Is it any wonder that middle Australia will continue to desert them in the face of a tax package from this government that offers real benefits of a substantial nature—money in their pockets? The government has not and will not betray middle Australia.

          I was interested to hear the member for Isaacs say that very few Australians will benefit from these tax measures.

           The family tax initiative will deliver to Australians in two different ways. Part A will provide assistance through an increase in one parent's tax free threshold of $1,000 for each dependent child. Assistance will be available to families whose combined taxable income is up to $70,000 for one child, plus $3,000 for each additional child. These benefits will be available through the Australian Taxation Office. They are also offered with the flexibility of being able to be claimed either during the income tax year through reductions in PAYE deductions in tax or when lodging a return at the end of the financial year.

           Part B of the family tax initiative provides further assistance to single income families—including sole parents—with at least one child under the age of five. The initiative increases the tax free threshold of the breadwinner by $2,500. This assistance is available where the taxable income of the breadwinner is less than $65,000 and the annual income of the non-working spouse is less than the income cut-off for the basic parenting allowance, currently $4,535. Here again the $65,000 threshold is increased by $3,000 for each child after the first.

           You can see that this measure has been clearly and unambiguously enunciated by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and I commend him for his work. Certainly one of the strengths of this tax initiative is its simplicity and clarity. There is no deception, no sleight of hand, no smoke and mirror tricks like those which we saw so often during the Keating budgets. What you will get in the coalition budget is a tax initiative which has been delivered in full and will provide genuine assistance for families.

           Unlike the old style Keating&amp;hyphen;Dawkins&amp;hyphen;Willis budgets, this budget does not rely on deception and rhetoric to trick the public into thinking that they are really better off.

            combined taxable incomes of less than $70,000, with an additional $3,000 added to the income threshold for each additional child. When you start translating that into some examples, you see that a family with one dependent child on a family income of less than $70,000 will be $7.70 per fortnight better off.

           It must be remembered that under the coalition government a dependent child includes all dependent children up to the age of 16 as well as dependent secondary school students up to the age of 18 years. In keeping with the Howard government's commitment to making the tax system more sympathetic to single income families, the second aspect of the tax package initiative focuses exclusively on this group.

           In real dollars and cents, the second part of the tax initiative will be worth an additional $19.20 per fortnight to those people who are eligible. A family with four dependent children which meets both part A and part B criteria will receive total assistance of $50 per fortnight. I might interpose here that that would be in addition to health insurance rebates which might return to that family anything up to $9 a week or $18 a fortnight. So that family I quoted in the last instance could be up to $68 a fortnight better off as a result of the combined measures.

           I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will probably find it difficult to believe but this government has delivered still more benefits to families. The family tax assistance initiative which I have outlined is available to all families with sufficient taxable income to benefit.

           In conclusion, I think this emphasises the generosity of the government across a whole range of sectors. I am surprised that members of the opposition have not looked at the detail of this and have been all too willing to be doctrinaire about it. The member for Isaacs talked about the Treasurer being the driest of the dry. I wonder whether he and his colleagues have lost sight of average Australians and have become the doctrinaires of the doctrinaire.

         —These bills which seek to implement the family tax initiative purport to be of benefit to Australian families.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These bills, to my way of thinking, are a classic example of the way in which this government has approached a whole range of policy areas. Its whole approach is based on the premise of give with one hand and take back with the other. We have seen produced here tonight figures which show how much families will apparently benefit, how much they will earn, as a result of these initiatives. What they do not show, and also what the material presented earlier by the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) does not show, is what is being taken on the other hand: what families are being given with tax breaks on the one hand are being taken away in a whole range of other areas.

         higher child&amp;hyphen;care costs and greater difficulty finding affordable places for babies and children with special needs, increased costs of supporting children who are students and no longer eligible for Austudy  and increased costs supporting unemployed children under 18 who would otherwise have been eligible for a minimum rate of youth training allowance or sickness allowance. So the taking hand of this government I would have to say is much busier than the giving hand.

        It is not the case, as the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), said, that the smoke and mirrors tricks do not apply. They certainly do apply here. What I want to concentrate on tonight is particularly those families who are using child care. Over half a million children in this country are in Commonwealth funded child care. Child care is of critical importance to a great number of Australian families. An overview in a recent EPAC task force report stressed the importance of `child&amp;hyphen;care services for Australian families and the importance for government to get child&amp;hyphen;care arrangements right'. Under Labor, we had the growth of a world-class system of child care that was high quality and affordable. Most importantly, it was introduced to meet the needs of working women. We recognised that women cannot work if there is not adequate child care.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Tonight I want to go through five important things about this budget and child care and what it really means for families and explain how, as a result of these changes to child care, the family tax initiative goes nowhere towards meeting increased child&amp;hyphen;care costs. The operational subsidy for community based long day care has been abolished `to encourage services to become more efficient and cost competitive with the private sector'. This is the level playing field argument of the economic rationalists from the other side. It is also the argument that conveniently forgets that community based long day care provides services such as more places for babies and children with special needs, and extended opening hours, just to name a few of the things it does.

        It is the case that some private sector services do provide these services but, on the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         whole, the community based services provide more in these areas because of the operational subsidy. This operational subsidy equates to $14 a week for a child over three and $21 a week for a child under three. Fees for community based long day care are likely to go up by this amount. The alternative to raising fees is cutting services. I just want to read from a little piece—

        I want to quote from a community based long day centre called Scallywags in Bathurst which I visited recently. What they put forward to me were alternatives to fee increases: first, no longer provide cooked meals for the children; second, reduce or cease to provide care for the under two age group; third, reduce the numbers of staff or their hours; or, fourth, re-evaluate the after&amp;hyphen;school program and incorporate these children into the long day care program, which would put an age limit on the number of children who could come.

         Community centres are, of course, more likely to be found in rural and remote areas as well as in low income areas. As part of the smoke and mirrors trick, this government is making much of the $8.3 million that they are providing to help community based centres manage the loss of operational subsidies. But, once again, it is $8.3 million on the one hand and $100 million taken away on the other.

In fact, today I have received 38 letters from families with children in Alice Springs who use community based long day care. They certainly do not for one minute think that the family tax initiative is going to compensate them for the large number of children who are completely dependent on community based long day care in Alice Springs. Secondly, there are the number of children who no longer will be able to access places because of the absolute removal of community based long day care.

I was saying that the demand for child care in this country will not be met as a result of the changes in this budget because 5,500 places that were part of Labor's goal of meeting the demand for child care will no longer be met because of this budget. I quote the words of the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, who said:

         The disappointing thing for families in New South Wales is that a significant number of the places were going to go to high need areas, including western and south western Sydney.

        <para>
         The third point I want to make is that, if you do not qualify for this much trumpeted family tax initiative that gets completely wiped out by the increased costs of community long day care, your child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate is going to be slashed by a third. The introduction of the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate by Labor recognised that the cost of child care is a work related expense and that it can be a significant disincentive for women thinking about taking up employment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Like other tax concessions for work related expenses, the rebate was not means tested. Despite a specific promise not to touch this rebate—another broken promise that we have from this government—what we have seen in this budget is that the government has in fact applied a means test to the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate.

         Fourthly, changes to child-care assistance, which many parents know as fee relief, mean that all parents will have higher out-of-pocket expenses for child care. The fee ceiling has been frozen, but the minimum fee will continue to increase thereby squeezing the amount of fee relief they might get. The income cut&amp;hyphen;offs for families who have more
         <break page="4932" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          than one child in care have been reduced, meaning that anyone with more than one child will pay more. The $30 a week of income for each dependent child, which was not taken into account to work out how much fee relief you got, will now be taken into account. You will now have to pay the full costs of any child care you use over 50 hours a week.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us have a look at an example of what these changes to child&amp;hyphen;care assistance actually mean for a family. A couple on a combined income of $35,000 a year—say, he is a mechanic on $25,000; she is a sales assistant—with two children in care for 50 hours a week will be paying $29.16 a week more for a community based long day care centre. How much do they get from the family tax initiative? Some $7.70 a week. So they are a lot worse off under this budget. This family tax initiative is certainly not going to compensate for the increase in their child-care costs. There are many thousands of other children and their families who are going to affected in this way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us just remember what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) actually said during the election campaign about child-care assistance and the family tax initiative. He said that there would be a family tax initiative, but he also said that a Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party government would maintain the system of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance. But what is going to happen under this budget is that 330,000 families will pay more for child care because of these changes—much more than they are going to get from this family tax initiative.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fifthly, parents who use long day care or family day care can now choose to have their child&amp;hyphen;care assistance paid directly to them rather than to the service provider. Child&amp;hyphen;care centres will no longer have the certainty necessary to employ quality staff who provide children with the continuity of care that they need—a very serious matter for families.

         I do not want to labour too much the volume and tone of the letters starting to arrive from families protesting at the attacks on child care, but I thought I might just hold up some of the colourful things sent by young children that have arrived in the post today,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          such as these letters from Jacob and family, Nash and family, Melissa, and a number of other children. You can see that the children themselves have put together some very colourful letters trying to get me, people on our side of the House and, I am sure, those on the other side of the House to really try to understand the effect of the combination of the family tax initiative with these very serious increases in fees for child care.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason the smoke and mirrors are really starting to emerge is that these details have not been clear to parents.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is called a family budget with its family tax initiative as its centrepiece, but I would have to say that families—particularly families with children in child care—are just starting to see this budget unravel. The Prime Minister has tried to woo families with this family tax initiative, but as they start to add up the numbers we can see that the small benefits it will give families on the one hand will be taken away on the other. The bonus of the family tax initiative will largely, for most families, not offset the costs that families will face as a result of the rest of this government's cuts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Prime Minister said in the election campaign that this was going to be a government for all of us. What he really meant, particularly when it came to families, was that it is for families where one partner is at home caring for children and not for families where both parents work. Let us make this particularly clear. This is a very important point in this debate tonight. This family tax initiative is a direct transfer from families using child care to families where one person is at home caring for children. What it says loud and clear to working women—and we are now in the majority, in case those opposite have not worked it out—is, `Don't work or we will penalise you; we will take away your child&amp;hyphen;care assistance.' That, I think, is the full extent of the coalition's attempt to solve the
         <break page="4933" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         Families should not be dazzled by the dollar signs in the family tax initiative. It is the case that if your family depends on public health, public education or child care, or if you have somebody at TAFE or university, or a family member in a nursing home, or if you are trying to find a job, you just will not have those extra dollars, the $7.70—which will not go very far against all those increased costs—for very long, let alone have the time to enjoy them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might just draw attention to fact that it is the case that we know that this will not be the end of the cuts to child care. We have seen in the EPAC child&amp;hyphen;care task force many of the proposals that we know the government is considering, and we have no doubt that there will be further cuts to child care in next year's budget; further cuts to the impact of this family tax initiative.

         It is a very serious matter when the voters in the federal seat of Lindsay are now having a unique opportunity to show the government a cautionary sign. Today I was sent a copy of the flier that the Liberal candidate has just put out on child care. She does not mention a few facts, which I might just put on the record, particularly as they take away from the family tax initiative. This budget actually takes $500 million out of child care. It delivers increased fees for parents. None of these things were in her flier. All parents with children in community based child care—of which there are a very large number in Penrith—will be paying $20 a week per child more.

That concerns the disastrous Super League decision handed down by the courts last Friday. I do not think this is just a battle between two entrepreneurs and billionaires in Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch. Indeed, this is a battle between the history of the game and the public ownership of it, versus the private domination of this game by an individual.

        It is not just a matter of Friday's decision being un-Australian because what it says is that it is okay for a few greedy individuals to withdraw from their contracts, their honour of the game and their commitment to their communities, clubs and supporters in the interests of the dollar. I think it goes beyond that because it goes to the use of our leisure time and the way in which a great many of the fans wish to see the game go ahead.

Super League future club Penrith relies upon the use of Panthers Stadium or Penrith Park, as it was then. In 1988 it refurbished the ground with a $500,000 grant from the state government. Further, it got $350,000 from Footy Tab funds.

        What we have seen in sport in general which will impact on the quality of life of the people we in this parliament should represent is more and more funding at the elite level, at the risk of funding at the lower levels.

        It is symptomatic that this is occurring at the same time as the push of the dollar is trying to knock over a number of AFL clubs. The Sydney Swans have been very successful in their move to Sydney, but I certainly support the right of members of clubs such as

What we are seeing is the development of a real people's movement in support of their local communities and that tradition, and against the profit motives.

As evidence of that I give the fact that the Newtown Jets, the mighty club, are premiers for 1996 in the Metropolitan Cup in Sydney.

Some of the main symptoms are an inability to concentrate; memory disturbance—perhaps a couple of those might be appropriate for some members of this House—spatial disorientation; chronic sore throat, often with recurrent flu&amp;hyphen;like illness; tender and swollen lymph nodes; muscle pain; headaches, which often are very severe; and non&amp;hyphen;refreshing sleep.

        Current research suggests that a dysfunction of the immune system and the central nervous system are involved. The complexity of the illness means that the prognosis can be very difficult to predict. Some patients will make a slow and gradual progress over several years to a full recovery.

It is only Labor that fights these things. It is only Labor that does the decent things for the Nepean Hospital and the Liverpool and Campbelltown hospitals in my electorate.

        One of the greatest medical breakthroughs in recent times has been the discovery of the benefit of umbilical cord blood. Treatment of serious blood diseases such as leukaemia rely on the transplant of blood stem cells, which
        <break page="4937" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         are the ultimate grandparents of all blood cells. These stem cells are very rare and are found in high concentration in bone marrow.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because of the difficulty in isolating stem cells, whole marrow is used for transplants in the treatment of leukaemia. This procedure is difficult for many reasons. Firstly, finding a compatible match is expensive and at best has a one in four chance of finding a suitable donor. Then, if a suitable match can be found, the risk of rejection remains high. Patients have to be prepared for the transplants with heavy doses of chemotherapy and radiation to suppress the body's immune system and to help reduce the possibility of rejection. A bone marrow graft typically involves a team of seven medical staff in an operating theatre. Tragically, all these distressing procedures are more often than not being endured by very young children.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All this suffering will soon be a thing of the past. The discovery that umbilical cord blood contains the essential blood stem cells in large numbers brings new hope to thousands of people awaiting bone marrow transplants. A cord blood graft can be done by a single nurse and does not have the difficulties of finding a compatible donor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Tragically, at present over 50 per cent of children with cancer have no matched bone marrow donors. At present there is no cord blood bank in Australia and the cost of searching for and transporting suitable product from the USA currently stands at around $28,000 per person, far out of the reach of most Australians in desperate need of this procedure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Cord Blood Bank has been established at the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital to collect, store and freeze stem cells from babies' umbilical cords to be used in lieu of marrow transplants. Under the guidance of Professor Vowels AM, the Director of the Department of Haematology and Oncology, and the Rotary Club of Northbridge, the aim is to establish a cord blood bank of 5,000 frozen cord blood collections within three years and to make the stored blood available without cost nationally and for a fee internationally. Once a cord blood bank is established with 5,000 donors, the running costs
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         would be minimal, as only regular donor replacements and replenishments would be required to maintain the 5,000 blood collections.

This major commitment from the coalition government, a government which has shown great integrity and compassion, will now allow this dream to become a reality.

         That community based child-care centre in Midvale is in the vicinity of the electorate of the Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). More of the Shire of Mundaring is in her electorate than in mine. I know that very many members of families from that particular child-care centre have attempted to wait upon her office to get some indication of hopefully a change in the government's attitude in this respect. Very many people in the community generally have waited upon government members, government ministers or former government members in this respect.

         When I was checking the details of local authorities, I was frankly surprised to learn that the local authority which has the largest number of community based long day care centre places in Australia is the City of Penrith. The total grant to the City of Penrith local council for the 17 long day care centres that the City of Penrith operates is $738,056.80. It is proposed that that operational subsidy be withdrawn. The calculation that is being done on behalf of the City of Penrith is that, if that operational subsidy were withdrawn from 1 July 1997 and the direct cost were to be transferred to families through child-care fees, there would be an increase of between $20.35 to $23.50 per child per week.

         I am told that, when families in Penrith became aware of the massive slug and the

          massive increase that the government's decision in the budget in respect of community based long day care centres would have on families, a rally of thousands of local family members marched upon the erstwhile member for Lindsay, Miss Kelly, trying to find the mythical shop where Miss Kelly allegedly works to make the point to her that this is a massive burden which the government is proposing to place on families in Penrith and on families throughout Australia.

         The figure is quite staggering. The council of the City of Penrith has 17 long day care centres. The operational subsidy is over $738,000. This government and its candidate at the Lindsay by-election propose to place that burden on families in Penrith, to their great cost.

I stand simply so that there is no reflection on the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth)—who, as I left the meeting following you, said she was supposed to be in the Main Committee. I said, `Don't worry, Trish, I will be there to cover for you,' not realising that she had a 4.30 p.m. responsibility. I arrived, imagining I was to follow the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). I have, in fact, unwittingly caused this delay in the Main Committee, and the delay should not reflect unfairly on Ms Worth.

I might say that I adjourned to 4.40 p.m. to ensure that there was adequate time for a quorum to be present because, if I had reoccupied the chair and a quorum had not been present, I would have been forced, according to standing orders, to adjourn the sitting of the committee until tomorrow.

         —In the amendment proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), there are a number of references to the impact that the budget measures would have on those who make Australia their country of settlement. The main burden of this budget is, of course, on cost recovery from that sector, but the damage goes deeper because it is compounded with changes to settlement policies which run quite counter to the national interest and also to the interests of those who have made Australia their home.

        If I begin with the direct budget measures, I suppose an overall summary of the budget would be to say that it takes something over $1 billion from the area of immigration and immigration support, whilst it boasts of spending some $64 million over four years: a net reduction of expenditure in this area of something of the order of $950 million. There are boastful announcements in the budget of trifling additional expenditure, but they are overwhelmed with new charges.

        The government says it will spend an additional $17 million on English language programs over four years, but it is going to slug users of those services over twice that amount during the same period. That is a tax on the coalition's commitment, which they proudly boasted before the election would ensure that all migrants would have the opportunity to gain effective communication. The rise proposed to each individual from $2,205 to $5,500 is in fact a deterrent to new settlers learning what the coalition called, before the election, a common language which is the glue of a cohesive nation.

        The government is planning to raise an additional $16.5 million in migrant health service charges whilst cutting back access. The family reunion program, which the government promised to reject, is cut; yet the costs for visa and other filing applications will yield over $37 million in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The cost of visitor visas is up 200 per cent, the fee for application for change of status to permanent resident is up 120 per cent, and even the fee to become an Australian citizen has increased.

        Spending on multiculturalism, which was formerly the responsibility of the now defunct Office of Multicultural Affairs which was formerly in the Prime Minister's Department, is more than halved. The commitment to work with the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia—FECCA—is at least in doubt. With respect to FECCA, the policy of the government would appear, certainly to most observers, to be no more than that of intimidation. The budget for FECCA has not been resolved. On two occasions now the organisation has been told that decisions relating to its funding are being postponed pending further consideration and further reviews, and the organisation still has had no advice as to whether or not it will have its funding at the end of this year. The minister, in fact, has
        <break page="4945" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         announced a review which only commences its work in December and the budget for the organisation runs out at about the same time.

        The government, at a time when the subject of immigration and the implications for Australia of choices being made by this government are at the forefront of every newspaper, every editorial, every columnist, is holding an axe of funding over the principal body that speaks for ethnic Australians. It is not resolving that and I regard that as a complete travesty and a failure of this government to act in a way which is honourable.

        Mr Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, boasted of adding multiculturalism to his portfolio. In his charter of responsibility on multiculturalism, he has said nothing on this across all portfolios, a practice observed by previous governments. There is nothing in the budget that refers to the way in which the interests and concerns of people from different cultural backgrounds are going to be recognised and respected in the different works of the various agencies. To me, the failure to produce such a document is a stinging indictment of this government's claim to speak for all Australians.

        With regard to the $10 million promised before the election with respect to racial vilification education, only $5 million is committed, with the rest to follow a `review'. But nothing appears in the forward estimates, which means, of course, that the government is set to break yet another election promise. With respect to a racial vilification campaign, spending $5 million on that is akin to spitting against a hurricane when the Prime Minister has sat mute for so long while the whirlwinds of racial intolerance are fanned. His conspicuous silence remained to such a degree that people of goodwill, even on his own side of politics, felt the need to speak out, and to speak out in terms that can only be regarded as those of the greatest of alarm.

        In short, Mr Ruddock is boasting about spending $64 million while, by gutting, slashing and ramping up charges—and add the recoveries intended to be made, particularly by the extension of the waiting period for two years and a number of other measures announced by the government and implemented in this budget—he will grab something over a billion dollars.

        The government proposes that new settlers not have access to a whole range of education, labour market and social security support. They have made, in recognition of the damage that this will cause, a token additional contribution to emergency relief organisations—private charitable organisations—to pick up the broken pieces that their policy recognises will follow from that heartless approach.

        It is not only heartless, it is irresponsible. It is irresponsible because, if one looks at the time when people make a success of coming to this country, forming a new future, building the roots that enable them to go on and make their family's and their own success in this country, the first two years are the critical periods. If there are savings to be made, project them forward. But the first couple of years when people first arrive are inevitably going to be periods when people are most at risk of finding themselves in difficulties. If Australia is unable to provide for them the kinds of opportunities necessary to make effective settlement, to help them find educational skills if their skills do not prove to be adequate, to help them into labour market programs if their hopes are not met by employment—or help them find some emergency relief if their circumstances do not prove as they hope—then we are building up problems for the future. We are building up a large store of problems for future generations by what is a short&amp;hyphen;sighted and penny&amp;hyphen;pinching approach.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the areas, of course, where the impact is most to be felt is in the area of English language. Successive governments have expanded services available to new arrivals to this country to make sure that people do acquire effective English language skills so that they can make effective settlement. In its pledge before the last election, the coalition criticised the failure of the former government to expand those services adequately and indicated it was pledged to additional funding and to make certain that those services were more readily available to, as they put it at that time, ensure that the glue that makes for our social cohesiveness holds.

         But what do we find in the area of English language programs? What we do find is that in its first budget, the Howard government has announced a 250 per cent increase for access to English language classes under the adult migrant education program. But the fee will rise from $2,205 to $5,500 at 1 January 1997, with an interim rise to $4,405 at 1 October of this year. That has simply put the program out of reach for many migrants.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister, Philip Ruddock, fools no&amp;hyphen;one with his announcement of additional funding of $17.6 million over four years. That was a pledged amount the minister claims that was delivered on in this budget. By the time the first instalment of that money is paid in 1 July 1997 the Howard government will have collected $11.6 million in user charges from the same program, up from $2.8 million in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. What you see just in that short period of time, before any money is paid out, is that a collection of $11&amp;half; million will be made and then the additional fees that are being charged will more than double, on a recurrent basis, the new expenditure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The language in the media release by the minister gives rise for concern about the future of the program. He speaks of consultations with migrants, service providers, state and territory governments and the wider community. It seems that this is setting up a preamble for what are now ambiguously called reviews, which are intended to bring to an end programs which the government feels less than comfortable with.

         Apart from migrants from English speaking backgrounds, many skilled migrants with much to offer our economy will be severely disadvantaged. Again, it is not the individual disadvantage to the particular new arrival that we ought to be most concerned about, notwithstanding that we should all, I think, have a compassionate response to people who have made such a wrenching decision to come from another place and to make their new home in this country as a permanent member of our community. I suspect there is none more traumatic, none more complex than the decision to actually leave the land of one's birth and to move to a new country to intend to become a permanent resident of that country and to face so many great changes that inevitably confront you.

         The measures that are intended by this government to set up brick walls to those who come here to enter the work force, making access to English language programs more difficult, will lead to consigning many to despair and long&amp;hyphen;term dependence on social welfare. The simplistic justification of full cost recovery ignores the real benefits that such programs produce. The adult migrant education program has a solid track record of success and would be directly responsible for ensuring many new settlers' successful entry to the work force. And, again, the real cost of this bad policy will be manifest in future years.

         It is certainly possible, and ought to be possible, to contemplate a different outcome from this, especially if considered with many other measures proposed by the Howard government. We ought not to use mechanisms of this nature to seek to deter people coming to Australia. The Prime Minister today said that the government remained committed to non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory immigration policies. It hardly makes sense in that environment to create barriers of this nature which plainly will disadvantage people who lack fluent English language skills to make successful settlement. It consigns those now in this country and those to come to great difficulty in making that successful transition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might also, in the little time that is left to me, reflect on the nature of the changes to the program itself. The government has recently introduced regulations which propose profound and unprecedented changes to the way in which Australia will proceed in the selection of those who come to this country. There is relatively little difference between the two parties in terms of the size of the intake. Pandering, I believe, to a sentiment that exists in the community, the Prime Minister has couched his description of that intake as a slash in the migration program, and the Deputy Prime Minister said that the government had taken steps because the program had been out of control. The truth is that the program of the current government is about average for the previous term of the Keating government which, in its own term, was the lowest post&amp;hyphen;war migration period in Australia's history.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we have no significant argument about numbers between us, but we do have very significant arguments about the way in which the program is being manipulated. Some people, I think, are already making suggestions to accommodate outcomes which are intended to make it less possible for people from some parts of the globe to come to this country; outcomes which have been designed and manipulated in that deliberate manner. Others are more charitably saying that it simply has that accidental effect.

         But whatever the account of that is—and that debate will happen in the discussion about the regulations and in wider forums than this—I think that I should focus on one particular savage decision of the government, and that is with respect to spouses. With no evidence other than the lead&amp;hyphen;out of anecdotal stories of abuse of the spouse arrangements, the government has proposed that from henceforth, the right of Australians to marry people of their own choice will be abridged. It has never happened before.

          And to the extent that sporadic and occasional abuse occurs, I have assured the government that we stand ready with them to act against it.

         What the government is proposing to do is to cap spouse visas. That is to say that, at a particular time, no more Australians will be permitted the privilege of bringing their marriage partner to this country. I regard that as outrageous. And the greatest condemnation of that actually comes not from me, but in the words of the now Minister for Immigration (Mr Ruddock). When legislation which first allowed capping of any visa categories came before the parliament, what he said, with respect to a specific decision to make it plain that that capping could not apply to spouses, was:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Minister has agreed to two specific amendments. One was to exclude the immediate family category—that is, spouses, dependent children and aged parents. I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through a year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia—no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. We have saved the Government great agony had it persisted in that area.

        <para>
         Of course, it was never the government's intention whatsoever to persist in that area. The amendments were moved to make absolutely clear that no party in this parliament would tolerate that abuse. And now the government in which Mr Ruddock is a minister comes before us to do what he has condemned as unconscionable. It is a disgrace.

         —The member for Denison has further suggested that the reduction in numbers—which has bipartisan support, which has been recognised by the opposition as being a responsible view to take of our present immigration policy—will in some way have racist overtones and lead to an emphasis on migration from one area of the globe rather than another. Let me equally refute that sort of allegation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        All that the government has done in relation to immigration in these budget papers is to pick up what has been the call from the former government, in a bipartisan sense, to reduce the number of migrants freely coming into Australia—not to reduce a particular category. If that were the proposal I would be indignant in my opposition. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, I know and I believe every responsible member knows, that all the government seeks to do is to offer a fair and internationally defensible immigration policy.

        For that reason I also take issue with the member for Denison. In his opening remarks he has suggested that the two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period proposed for migrants who come into Australia, which will make it more difficult for them to access Commonwealth benefits, is in some way an unfair measure—as if the government were proposing to take new migrants who come into Australia and deny them access to all benefits without forewarning.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The simple reality is that every migrant coming into Australia beyond this budgetary period knows that they will come in to a two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period. All that the government has said is that the responsibility that every new Australian will face is the responsibility of making provision for their settlement in Australia for a period of two years. It would be very difficult in my electorate, and I suspect in any other electorates across the nation, including the electorate of the member for Denison, to find electors who are offended by that.

        I have a large migrant community in my electorate; an electorate which is made up of a number of horticultural crops which are labour intensive and which for that reason have attracted people with a relatively low capital base and a willingness to work. Within my migrant community there is overwhelming support for the proposal that people should wait two years before being able to access these sorts of Commonwealth benefits. Given that my migrant community supports it, you can be sure that most people across the nation feel this is a responsible step and most certainly do not see it as having any of the racial overtones implied by the member for Denison.

I want in my opening remarks to say that, given the time that has been spent on these bills in the chamber, the action of the government is entirely appropriate.

         There has been a significant deterioration in the state of Australia's fiscal position over the past seven years.

The 1996&amp;hyphen;97 Budget represents a sensible and well balanced commitment to the Government's objective of achieving a balance in the underlying Budget over the course of the economic cycle. It is likely to boost business confidence, support lower interest rates, and provide the foundation for ongoing low inflationary growth.

         There can be no doubt that the deterioration in public finances has been partly responsible for this development. In this context, it is simply not acceptable, after four years of solid economic growth, that Australia should have been running an underlying deficit of over $10 billion.

         The simple reality is that as independent a source as the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, has said that there is no more urgent need facing this nation than addressing the underlying debt and removing, so far as possible, the $10 billion deficit.

         Around this appropriation debate there has been a great deal said about the partial sale of Telstra. Much of this will be addressed later in this chamber and, of course, in the House of Representatives chamber as well. But the simple reality that seems to escape all economic commentators is that the government's enthusiasm for the partial sale of Telstra is entirely motivated not by a proposal to find $1 billion or $1.2 billion to spend on the environment but by a desire to find $7 billion to address our overseas debt and to reduce the overseas debt by something like 10 per cent. What the now opposition cannot escape is that when they came to office overseas borrowings in Australia ran at something like $23 billion, and when they left office overseas borrowings in Australia ran at something like $185 billion.

And in order to trim those government borrowings by 10 per cent and so make the economic objectives of the government more achievable, we need the partial sale of Telstra. That is the motivation that has been lost in the nonsense that has been run about using the Telstra moneys for the environment when, in reality, as a member of the government, I want that partial sale to reduce my overseas outlays and so give me an opportunity to realistically reduce interest rates within Australia.

         What does this budget do? We need to recognise that one of the things that the budget does is to effectively reduce the proportion of GDP that is going to the government.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Total outlays for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 are estimated to be $129 billion or 25.2 per cent of GDP, compared with $126 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, or 26.1 per cent of GDP. What the government can claim to have achieved while

         That is no mean feat.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to that, the government has done something about what foreign ownership is effectively undoing in Australia. In 1989, when the previous government was in power, there was something like $53 billion poured into Australia to acquire Australian assets. In 1996, when the previous government was no longer in power, $190 billion had been poured into Australia acquiring Australian assets for foreign ownership. Some of that was the result of policies of the former government. The government, for example, sold such facilities as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and so, effectively, injected one way or another additional foreign ownership into Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Critics will say, `But surely the proposal of the now government to partially sell Telstra will also inject additional foreign currency into Australia.' There is some truth in that, but the previous government sold those resources without—as my statistics illustrate—reducing the debt. The Howard government commits itself to using the resources of the partial sale of Telstra solely for the reduction of debt. That is a significant difference. We are doing something about pruning our outlays and unless we prune those outlays—the point made by the National Farmers Federation, and reinforced by Mr Bernie Fraser—we will bequeath to our children an impossible economic situation.

That will cost more money. That puts some of his irrigators at risk as the total capacity of the Hume Dam is run down.

         I have focused on those remarks because there is a complication that is a largely related one also occurring for South Australian irrigators. Not many people in this chamber will be aware of the fact that, for South Australian irrigators, Lake Victoria—which provides the sort of effective safety valve on water availability for South Australia—has also been run down, because wave action has unearthed Aboriginal burial grounds along the edge of the lake.

         The running down of Lake Victoria—which was done responsibly, to allow for the re&amp;hyphen;covering of those Aboriginal burial grounds with coarser soil at a cost of $1 million, which was provided in the budget—has had, as with the Hume Dam, a long&amp;hyphen;term adverse affect.
         <break page="4952" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          While Lake Victoria has been run down, 67 years of having Lake Victoria at a particular storage level has meant that water has penetrated the sandhills around the lake, probably for some kilometres. That water is now running back in, so that what is collecting in Lake Victoria is water that is much more saline than any irrigator or any domestic user can tolerate.

         The government—or, more accurately, the Murray&amp;hyphen;Darling Basin Commission—finds itself in a delicate balancing act to meet the reasonable demands of the Aboriginal community to have these burial grounds preserved and, at the same time, to ensure that South Australian irrigators do not have a head of saline water awaiting them. I make those comments because, under this budget, money is provided to the basin. As the Hume Dam is run down, the storage of Lake Victoria—not only for South Australian irrigators but also for New South Wales irrigators—next year may also be at risk, unless the Hume works can be accelerated and there is adequate rainfall to fill that dam.

          —As the member for Indi interjects, it also involves the town water supply and of course, ultimately, Adelaide's water supply. That is important because, as you will all appreciate, the South Australian irrigators are guaranteed a water allocation which comes from Dartmouth, Hume or Lake Victoria as the case may be; so that, while South Australia may be guaranteed that allocation, any shortage of available water in New South Wales and Victoria further exacerbates the problem of the guarantee that New South Wales and Victorian irrigators have. I make these comments to point out the importance of the budget to addressing the whole question of national debt and the fact that the budget has not ignored those principal environmental issues that need to be addressed in the national interest.

I also wanted to comment on the enthusiasm the government has shown for the reform of AQIS and for Australia's quarantine measures to ensure that, within Asia, we have a guarantee that whatever vegetable, horticultural, meat and livestock products are provided come with a blue&amp;hyphen;ribbon guarantee and, equally, that we are secure in the knowledge that any products imported into Australia will not bring with them the pests and diseases that would put at risk our reputation as a clean and green producer.

         —One of the more surprising features of this budget is the extent to which post&amp;hyphen;election revelations were accurate about the condition of the Commonwealth deficit for last financial year; that is, 1995&amp;hyphen;96. Forward costings that were then released demonstrated that the previously concealed effects of expenditure into future years inevitably meant that Labor's legacy would see even more copious bleeding of budgetary red ink unless severe measures to staunch the flow were taken immediately.

        While the coalition undoubtedly knew before and during the last election campaign that Labor was fudging by concealing the true position, the previous government has given its new successor the near perfect cop&amp;hyphen;out in the eyes of the public.

        The danger for all Australians is a perception by the government that, despite its broken promises, it can do exactly what it likes into the future, thereby fulfilling prophecies of arrogance which will match that of its predecessor.

         —Last financial year, revenue from all sources, before asset sales, totalled $121,660 million—up from $44,795 million in 1983, when Labor first took office. For this year it is estimated to be $130,160 million, an increase over last year of $8,500 million. That increase on its own would have been nearly enough to balance this budget had it not been for expenditure growth locked into current and forward expenditure by Labor.

        As it is, it seems to have turned out that the government will get away politically unscathed with breaking its undertakings to not increase taxes—as in fact it has, with Medicare and the superannuation imposts. The `read my lips' tax undertakings are apparently dismissible as not being `core' promises. Labor is equally, if not more, culpable because it provided the excuses now being employed by the government. On behalf of all decent, trusting Australians I say, `A plague on both your houses'.

        It is hard enough to do the job of an elected representative, without being tagged by mere association as an inveterate liar. It is uncontested conventional wisdom that the tax grab on superannuation funds was pounced on at the last moment, given the government's change of heart about the fuel tax rebate.

        One can only wonder whether the parliament's virtually unanimous support for an increase in the Medicare tax to buy firearms from the public encouraged the government to go one per cent further, albeit selectively. Why this government continues the charade that encourages the widespread belief that the Medicare so&amp;hyphen;called levy meets the cost of funding Medicare is beyond comprehension. Because it is a tax on income the levy should be integrated into the more progressive income tax regime. It would also be one way of simplifying the tax system.

         Both tax hikes in the budget expand the opportunity for future windfalls to revenue by way of bracket creep. It must be a source of despair for government in times of low inflation that the previous bounty from bracket creep is diminished. Perhaps the government realises that, by creating unindexed income brackets where none previously existed, as in the cases of new imposts on contributions to superannuation and Medicare, new growth taxes are there for the taking. But where does it stop? The superannuation funds were already a milch cow under Labor. Now that the coalition has made its initial bid for the lucrative spoils and has set a precedent, what logical impediment is there in the way of a future government of any persuasion to, say, lower the threshold, firstly, to be set at an unindexed income of $70,000 per annum in the case of the super tax? As it is now no longer to be a matter of principle that a particular level of income should be a determinant because the precedent has been set, it becomes a question of how much can be raised rather than whether further income tested imposts can be levied.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The same concern about the behaviour of a future government surrounds new ground to be broken by partial income testing of the Medicare levy. It is now a pretty safe bet that in the lifetimes of most in this parliament the income threshold in this budget to apply to both the superannuation contribution and the Medicare levy tax hikes will be lowered, or become multi&amp;hyphen;tiered, along the lines of present day income tax brackets. It is a safe bet.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Furthermore, without indexation of the threshold applying to these groundbreaking new tax measures, new elements for growth of revenue by way of stealth, in the form of bracket creep, will have been created. The costs of complying will be considerable but, no doubt, they will be calculated and revealed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the relevant legislation. These increases, or new taxes, present further incursions into the household component of domestic savings, albeit to the advantage of public sector savings.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Treasurer has been scathing in comments about the deterioration of the levels of domestic savings under Labor, and with good cause. Yet there is absolutely nothing in this budget which will lead to increased private savings in the near term. The reverse is true. The two measures just mentioned are prime examples.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It might be instructive if the government looked at some of the measures which it could tackle to meet what so far is merely its rhetorical concern. That the plummeting household savings occurred over a period of high inflation and revenue growth induced by income tax bracket creep, in large part, is no mere coincidence. Automatic indexation of the excise on petroleum products was also a factor, along with some pretty hefty imposts on the same commodities by state governments. More insidious, but nevertheless a huge drain on private savings, have been deliberate policy decisions which have brought forward the collection of a whole range of taxes and the associated compliance costs.

          —On the pretext that as many income related taxes should, as near as achievable, be collected on a basis equating with pay&amp;hyphen;as&amp;hyphen;you&amp;hyphen;earn collection, huge private savings were transferred to the public sector, the proceeds of which Labor then blew like a drunken sailor. The budget surpluses of the late 1980s were as much a product of the earlier collection of taxes as of raiding Commonwealth funding for the states. The most notorious example is provisional tax, the uplift factor added, which removed permanently a hard core

         Also contributing to the decline in household savings was the credit card mentality boosted by high inflation which permeated society generally. State and federal governments led the way by example. After all, if governments do not have to occasionally balance the books and spend less than raised, why should mainstream Australia? On top of all that were new imposts, such as fringe benefits and capital gains taxes, which raided domestic as well as business savings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So little has been tackled in this budget which will improve what the government itself acknowledges to be totally inadequate levels of domestic savings. Looking at the bigger picture, even commendable relief from capital gains taxes otherwise payable by the proprietors of small unincorporated businesses will be insignificant. Nor will the business sector in general contribute, in the foreseeable future, to the restoration of domestic savings to anything approaching historically desirable levels, some seemingly heroic assumptions about economic growth forecasts in the budget papers notwithstanding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The collapse of the contribution of private sector businesses to domestic savings has gone hand&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;hand with the raising of new taxes and the earlier collections of existing taxes over the past 13 years. As with household savings, this is no mere coincidence. New taxes such as fringe benefits and capital gains imposts figured even more prominently in depleting the level of savings by the business sector. Even imputation of dividends, accompanied by an arguably offsetting reduction in the income taxing of companies, forced the earlier collection of part of what was formerly payable on company profits in the form of dividends in the hands of shareholders. It brought it forward. Escalating compliance costs, which do not add anything to government coffers—quite the reverse in fact—also played a part in depleting business sector savings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the wake of what has taken place, and what the government proposes in this budget, any improvement in the levels of domestic savings becomes just another impossible dream. Even if the budget is brought into surplus over the life of the present parliament, it will only result in containment of the federal government's borrowings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the end of March, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Commonwealth had eaten into domestic savings by borrowing a total of nearly $108,000 million, most of it in Australia. Its appetite and profligacy more than doubled to reach this record high over a paltry three years, the past three years. While the new government can rightly claim its predicament is Labor's fault, it might also, in the interests of transparency, make it clear that it is in no position to do more than contain borrowings to around present levels.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such a prognosis might also throw some light onto the prospects for reducing our overall international indebtedness. No matter what gloss anyone might care to put on it, the net national debt could be around $200,000 million at the end of this government's first term—assuming there is no early election. It is no consolation to know that that figure could be halved, to manageable levels if, by waving a magic wand, the government's own borrowings could be eliminated overnight. But that is a measure of the significance of those government borrowings.

         The reality is, however, with balance of payments deficits still running well in excess of $1,000 million a month, any fiscally responsible government faces pure hard slog. Whatever the spin doctors in either the government or opposition may say, this budget represents a very
         <break page="4957" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         To put concerns about forecasts into some perspective, the three&amp;hyphen;year plan to bring the budget into underlying surplus is accepted as immutable. The underlying balance estimates call for the deficit last year of $10,317 million to reduce this year to $5,649 million and in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 to reduce to $1,548 million, and for a surplus in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 of $957 million.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Major deterioration of either the revenue or expenditure assumptions, or both, is more likely than an improvement in either or both. This is because forward estimates for the current and ensuing years are at the end of the scales most favourable to the desired outcome. For example, estimated economic growth over the three years, essential to projected revenue forecasts being met, could hardly be higher, and historically they are unattainable at this time in the economic cycle, which is arguably on the wane.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, while the short term—that is, 12 months or thereabouts—assumption for inflation seems reasonable, estimates of wages growth are possibly optimistic over both the short and medium term. Most regrettable of all, the human tragedy of unemployment is unlikely to be alleviated over the government's first term as it grapples with Labor's legacy. The Treasurer has predicted that there will be no improvement over the short term. More likely, unemployment will get worse before, or if, it gets better.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To summarise, forecasts for economic and incomes growth, as well as for unemployment, are, if anything, on the sides which promote the best possible budget outcomes, both for this year and ensuing years. Normal prudence in any other field of endeavour would require best&amp;hyphen;case and worst&amp;hyphen;case scenarios and mean averages to be adopted as the bases for forward planning.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Like those before it, this budget and the accompanying rhetoric present the rosiest possible picture. A more responsible approach might be to present both worst&amp;hyphen;case and best&amp;hyphen;case forward estimates and outcomes, and not just the latter. More prudent still would be projected outcomes based on the averages of the highest and lowest in an expected range of movements in the rates of economic growth, employment, wages and the like. As it stands, the risks associated with the key forecasts which underpin assumptions about budgetary outcomes over the next three years are, to use the vernacular, all downside risks.

         One of the more pleasing features of the budget is the government's reaffirmation of an election promise to legislate for a `charter of budget honesty'. When the next election is called, Treasury estimates of the then current condition of the budget, along with forward estimates, will be published. The sort of nonsense witnessed in the past, when governments changed hands and new administrations blamed their predecessors for concealing independent estimates, should not be possible in the future. The voting public will not then have to endure so many broken promises, excused because the incoming executive did not have an accurate picture of the state of the Commonwealth's accounts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Although adoption of a charter will have the effect of the opposition not announcing detailed policy until an election is under way because its promises cannot be costed either in quantum or for effect, that is also not necessarily a bad by&amp;hyphen;product. More honest campaigns should ensue. If so, it will not be easy to break promises post&amp;hyphen;election because of some real or perceived misconception about the true state of our fiscal condition.

Those three major commitments were made prior to the election. Those three commitments, I believe, have been well and truly addressed in this year's budget. I wish to speak to those three points.

Members of the opposition have been attempting to portray those who created this budget as hardened conservatives, in some way out of touch with the needs and aspirations of mainstream Australian society. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.

Of course, we could have devised the most lax, expensive and extravagant budget in this country's history. We could have maintained a policy of fiscal irresponsibility, which was becoming something of a tradition for the Labor government.

If delivering a budget that lays a foundation for a more stable and secure Australia means criticism from those interest groups, so be it.

        Once again the government is accused of presenting a slash and burn budget which neglects its social responsibilities. It is hard to understand the logic of such accusations when the government has met its election commitments in areas such as superannuation, involving an 18 per cent rebate to individuals who make superannuation contributions on behalf of spouses with low incomes; low incomes, not high incomes. For example, the government will allow banks and other financial institutions to assist low income earners by providing retirement savings accounts; these will benefit from the same taxation benefits as other superannuation products. Furthermore, the government is assisting these same low income earners by increasing the threshold of employer contributions under the super guarantee charge from $450 to $900 per month. This measure helps those who need the money now and were unlikely to benefit from the small super contribution.

Let me state categorically that they will not. For example, the removal of the operational subsidy for community based long day child-care centres effective from July 1997 simply addresses the imbalances between the community sector and the private providers of child-care services. The subsidy was introduced in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s to assist the community and since then there has been an explosion in the number of places provided by the private sector.

        Young families that are facing the burden of buying their first home will be extremely sceptical of claims by the opposition that this is an uncaring and unsympathetic budget. What young families will be quick to notice is how the government's fiscal responsibility and readiness to tackle the nation's debt will gradually lead to an environment in which interest rates will come down and the country will approach the level of certainty. Young families will be certain that their children will be able to grow up in a fair Australian society; a society which will have achieved a degree of sound fiscal responsibility. In fact this fiscal responsibility is already demonstrating itself. Since the election we have witnessed a drop in home interest rates delivering to mortgagees a saving equivalent to approximately $80 per month. I certainly expect this trend to continue and, as the economic forecasters indicate, there could very well be a further drop between now and the end of the year.

Our approach focuses on individuals and their needs, not on programs or program objectives. It is a person's need that is far more important as to whether or not money will be expended and in what form that money will be expended, not whether or not a specific program in itself should be justified. We will help people when they need it. Labor's approach to impose a 12&amp;hyphen; to 18&amp;hyphen;month delay on receiving labour market assistance was a major mistake.

        One hundred and eighty seven million dollars will be provided over the next four years to assist the transition from school to the workplace. I consider this particular program to be one of the most exciting initiatives in the budget—one of the unsung aspects of our budget. The school to work program will ensure that young people are not left stranded once they have left school.

         —I must say that aspects of this first budget by the conservatives in 14 years are very disturbing. My view can be summarised in saying that this budget is short on fairness and full of prejudice. It is a budget that has been driven by opinion polls. It is a budget that this government has at every opportunity gone out and sold by attacking the soft targets. Never before have we seen in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to a budget ministers making announcements in the manner in which they have done. In particular, we saw the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) give a doorstop

        The tragedy was that on the same day that he announced that there would be some $470 million over four years cut from the ATSIC budget we had an announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, that the miners and the farmers would retain their diesel fuel rebate. The diesel fuel rebate in its totality offers concessions in the order of $1.2 billion per year to the miners and the farmers—more than the whole of the ATSIC budget. You see, it is sending the wrong signals. The indigenous community are prepared to suffer cuts that are fair, that are equitable, that are across the board, but these cuts to the ATSIC budget are none of that. They are targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged section of the community, while at the same time the more privileged sections of the community are spared cuts.

        In this budget we have the defence sector immune from spending cuts. The cuts should be across the board. The pain, if it is to be borne, should be borne equally. But this government has picked the soft targets and has fed into people's prejudices. Instead of learning from the mistakes of history, this government seems to be compounding the mistakes of history. It is worth quoting the words of Pastor Martin Niemoller, a Lutheran minister who was a critic of Hitler and the Nazis.

        The great tragedy is that this is not what the people were promised prior to the last election. They were promised that if John Howard were elected to the prime ministership he would have them feeling comfortable and relaxed by the year 2000. They were promised that this would be a government for all of us. The government for all of us quickly became a government for only some of us.

        The cruellest decision that this government made in the budget in relation to indigenous people was what it did to the community development employment program. John Howard talks about mainstream Australia. The Prime Minister says, `This is what the majority of people think.'

It has evolved into a scheme in which over 27,000 indigenous Australians voluntarily forgo their rights to Job Search Allowance (JSA) or New Start Allowance (NSA) to participate as employees in 262 CDEP projects throughout Australia for a wage that is approximately equivalent to JSA or NSA entitlements.

The red tape and the accountability that ATSIC has to observe are just double standards compared to what we ask of the rest of the community. The guilty parties in terms of the lack of services going to the indigenous community are state and territory governments. Where is the accountability for those governments in terms of providing essential services that we, the rest of the community, take for granted?

        The policies over those 20 years involved, in many cases, doling out money without looking for achievable goals and without determining that what we need is outcomes—not just spending and telling people to take the money and go away. We really have to look at the history, certainly of the government that he was part of—a member of the backbench, I think, at that stage—during that 13 years, and, in particular, we also have to look at the overall history of Aboriginal spending.

        To say that we have to look at it is not to say that we have any predisposed ill view towards Aborigines. It is an absolute outrage and an insult to suggest that we, on this side of the House, do not have compassion and caring towards that very disadvantaged sector of the community. But, in so far as ATSIC is concerned, any organisation that spends $140 million of its something like $800 million budget on administering itself, in an area where money is as scarce as it is in this area, has to be looked at carefully and there has to be a thorough examination of whether or not that sort of money can be spent in really uplifting the lives of Aborigines on the ground. In that respect, and in principle, I support money going in at the bottom and not money going in at the top. That is all I wish to say in relation to some of those remarks by my honourable friend.

        The budget, in my view, has been accepted widely in the community as a good budget. It is a budget that has had to take hard decisions, but it also is a budget of forward thinking in relation to some particular areas of interest that I have, notably the training initiatives and the focus on moving towards the expansion of vocational education in schools, and, in particular, the recognition of the need for greater apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. It is interesting to note that $187 million is going to be developed.

        In my own electorate of Dickson, the Pine Rivers High School has already, to some extent, been a beneficiary of the new focus towards developing, enhancing and expanding this latent opportunity. When a school like Pine Rivers has expensive machinery sitting idle between the hours of 3.00 p.m., after school finishes, and a reasonable hour for training, something like 10.00 p.m., and on holidays and weekends, and we have people out there who need training, it is absolutely incumbent upon us to try to utilise that equipment after hours. We must use it, as well, obviously, in relation to training in schools. The after hours use, which is part of the program that Minister David Kemp mentioned in parliament recently, is going to be taken advantage of in this particular area, and I applaud the direction of the government in that area.

        It is also important to realise that difficult decisions had to be taken in the overall budget context. The expenditure side of the equation had to be carefully looked at. However, in doing so, we must not be too blinded in looking for the black figure. There are groups of people out there—and I know this from representations that have been made to me in my electorate—who are largely being forgotten.

        These people have worked for something like 30 years in the Australian Public Service or perhaps in industry.

They are gradually shunted around on the train tracks and then put into a shed and left there, forgotten. However, these people are not forgotten by me. In this time of budgetary restraint we must not forget that there is a human factor involved. We must not forget the people who have these skills and this wisdom. Just because they are in their mid or late 40s and sometimes 50s does not mean they should be on the scrap heap. I do not accept that at all. We must always come back to the human factor.

        In that respect, I also have a criticism of those who are in work and their concern for those who are not in work. For a number of years, former Labor minister Clyde Cameron heavily criticised the 17.5 per cent loading on annual leave. He pointed out that it was intended for shift workers who received particular allowances which were built into the nature of their work. When they went on holidays, this allowance was designed to assist them to have a reasonable annual leave. That allowance then drifted right across the economy, and I recall Clyde Cameron speaking about the fat cats who got it as well.

        Both during the election campaign and since, a number of working people have said to me that they do not really need this. I question the notion that that is a non&amp;hyphen;negotiable, bottom line condition that could never be negotiated away in relation to what we are looking at in terms of rationalising workplace agreements and so forth. In this day and age, when people are out of work to such a degree, can we afford to have that luxury when, apart from the hardliners, most people would not really insist on having that loading? And yet now it is being built into the structure. I question that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I really wonder whether we should be starting to look at that, because it is obvious for all of us to see that there is a disparity between those who are in work and those who are not in work. Those who are not working are trudging around looking for work and those who are in work are doing very well, thanks very much. Some would say, and I would say, that in some cases they are doing too well at the expense of those who are not in work. It is easy to be critical of the trade unions' position on this, and I am sure the honourable member opposite will not accept this point of view. Once a member is out of work they generally cease to be a member of a union and as far as the union is concerned it is not terribly interested in him or her once they lose their job. I think that culture is to be deprecated, that once they are out of work the union is not particularly interested in that person.

        I also wanted to mention another area that concerns me about the budget, and that is the area of foreign aid. I believe that it is unfortunate that the ratio of aid to GNP has now dropped from 0.34 per cent to 0.29 per cent—the lowest percentage that we have ever contributed to foreign aid. Unfortunately, we have a populist view that has recently gained currency, where we have a member of parliament saying there should not be any foreign aid. I have had people say that to me in the course of my travels in the electorate, but I ask them, `Can you imagine your children with no basic services, lucky to have a crust of bread in their mouths every day, with no sanitation and no roof over their heads? Can you imagine that situation in your own children's case? Can you then say we should not have foreign aid?' They always come back to reality when you put that scenario to them.

         Unfortunately, we have this populist line that we would be a lot better off as far as our country is concerned if we did not have foreign aid. With a little bit of thinking about it, you come back to reality. It can be put this way: Australians have a history of helping their neighbours. That is part of the Australian ethos—to help your neighbour. Who is your neighbour? Is it just the bloke next door or the widow down the street? Is it someone in the other suburb? Or is it the neighbourhood of the whole community, and that is the world community, not just the community beside you.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To suggest that your neighbour is only that person living very handy to you is, in my view, to have a very narrow mind on this issue. I hate the use of the word `racist' because it is bandied about so easily. If a person has a different view to you then they are a racist. But when you think about it, to actually say, `Let us look after our own backyard and not worry about them,' isn't that really discriminating on the basis of race? Isn't that the purest form of discrimination on the basis of race? That means saying that our near neighbours are the ones we should look after and those others are not really our neighbours. Why? Because they are not living close, they have a different colour skin or their eyes are differently shaped to ours.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think we have a duty to the world community to look after those who are in dire need. The figures show that 20 per cent of people have 85 per cent of the world income and the poorest 20 per cent of those have only 1.4 per cent of the world's income. When you look at the statistics, how can a cut in the aid budget be justified? I do not cavil at the idea of trying to ensure that aid is better distributed and more wisely directed, but those who espouse that populist view of cutting out aid should question whether in the long run we are not going to be worse off. Aren't we going to be seen in the eyes of the world to be a miserable and selfish country? At the same time, by denying people the assistance that they need, we are perpetuating and entrenching more strongly the gulf between rich and poor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I emphasise in particular the wise use of aid, that is, the provision of the pump to pump out the water, or the provision of seed. The development of the infrastructure within the communities is going to help them in the end to improve their position. That is really what it is about. It is not about just throwing money at the situation, it is about providing solutions, providing education. There is a welcome increase in the aid budget for basic education and primary health care. In that respect I support the government's approach because education is one factor that is very important in ameliorating this problem.

         On the other side of the coin, the marginal decrease in funds for Africa and the decrease for south Asia is very disturbing. It is something that we cannot ignore. It is something that we have a duty to do something about. It is a duty of common humanity what we are talking about here. It does not do us any good to put it in the language that was put in the budget papers of, `Well, we really have to solve our own problems first'. That is an appeal to the most basic instincts. One could accept the cut without comment but to have a cut with that sort of self&amp;hyphen;justification is unacceptable and I do not agree with that sort of approach. In my view, the overall cut is a very sad one in the circumstances and it is a sad comment on our society.

         Overall, the budget is about correcting endemic debt problems at the national level, and that is to be applauded. Those hard decisions have had to be taken. In the long run one can say that Australia will be better off because of those decisions. The budget sets a path for recovery. However, there are areas of concern that we must never lose sight of and they include the human element, the unemployment element, and the aid element that I have just mentioned.

         —I enter this debate following on from my colleague, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), at a point where he referred to assistance for Aboriginal people. As a former Labor minister for Aboriginal Affairs and as one who held a portfolio for six years I want to say that I was deeply distressed and concerned by the statements made by the present Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) who, although he described the taking of Aboriginal children away from their parents as horrible, went on to say that some Aboriginal children had benefited by that experience.

         —At the time of the bells ringing, I was expressing my concern about the statements made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. When he was appointed I said that he needed time; he needed time to get over the complexities of what is probably one of the most difficult portfolios in government. The statement that he made has led to a continued loss of confidence and loss of respect for the minister; that statement will come back to haunt him. He should modify and retract those statements because there are people living in the Aboriginal society whose lives are still, irrespective of whatever education they may have had, dysfunctional. They will never overcome the pain and the burden of those actions of separating them from their families. This was an inappropriate statement and it is a matter, I hope, that the minister will, either immediately, or in time, correct.

        I am concerned that, because of some of the aspects of government policy, Aboriginal leadership across Australia is increasingly losing confidence in the government. We are heading down a track where we could easily see massive confrontation, with Aboriginal people believing that there is no hope for them, and no hope for their future in this society so long as the government continues with its present policy. That is a situation which would adversely affect all of us.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other aspect that I want to touch on very quickly is some of the remarks that were made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in her maiden speech. It has taken this nation, under a variety of governments, some time to get to the point where one can honestly say that there is no element of racism involved in our immigration policy. Wherever you come from—it does not matter whether you are seeking family reunion, whether you are trying to come here as a skilled person, or how you are trying to enter—the tests are exactly the same.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have to take issue with the honourable member for Oxley, certainly at a very personal level, because of the quote that she made of the late honourable Arthur Calwell, the founder of our immigration policy. She took—as it was possible to take, given his time in politics—a sentence to claim some support and express some admiration for an attitude which he expressed as minister at a time when he had just come out of a war in which many Australians had died and many families were suffering as a result of the near Japanese invasion of Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Calwell was well aware of the prevailing sentiment in Australia, as was the then leader of the Liberal Party, Robert Gordon Menzies. There was a generational attitude. In my own party—and I was present at the conference that overturned the white Australia policy—one could accurately predict the vote on the ages of the delegates. I do not think it was much different in the Liberal Party. And the fact is that we have come a long way since people were excluded on the basis of colour or creed. I would refer those who are interested in pursuing this matter to the very important publication by Professor Jerzy Zubrzycki, who made a study of Arthur Calwell and the origin of post&amp;hyphen;war immigration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason I feel very deeply about this is because, if one ever had a political mentor and political father, Arthur Calwell was mine. I was a pallbearer at his funeral. Three things happened at his funeral, but I will only mention the two which are relevant to this debate. Firstly, the former Prime Minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, who had lost his ability to walk, turned up outside St Patrick's Cathedral in his car. He sat there and paid tribute to his political opponent, personal friend and colleague. As the hearse passed, Robert Gordon Menzies lifted his hat, and then he left.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing that occurred on that day—and I refer this to the honourable member for Oxley—is that the only community in Calwell's electorate of Melbourne which closed its shops and trade while the funeral was taking place was the Chinese community. That was because Arthur Calwell was not merely their representative, he was their friend. When he left the ministry and was in opposition, he chose to use his time by learning another language, and the language he chose to learn was Mandarin.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He laid the basis for our immigration policy. The face of Australia we see today owes a great deal to his energy, his foresight and, indeed, the hard role he had to play. He had to deal with the issue of Japanese war brides. He had to deal with complex issues in a community where there was still, as I said, pain and suffering caused by the war.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Zubrzycki said that, on 2 August 1945, the then Leader of the Opposition, Robert Menzies, pledged his party's support, choosing to underscore Calwell's statement. Menzies said:

         We may have only those next 25 years in which to make the best possible use of our chance to survive. Our first requirement is additional population . . . These are grave words which I believe to be entirely true . . . My pledge to the Minister is that, if a choice has to be made between a policy of extreme caution and an adventurous policy which accepts risks because great results are involved, then let us have a more adventurous policy.

         Any person applying to come to Australia comes here on the basis of facing the same uniform test. Therefore, it is a matter of concern to me—and I think to many of my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House—when a newly elected member, one of our number, says that one group in the community should be excluded. She says that they should not be considered as potential citizens of Australia. Why? She makes no apology for it—it is because they are Asian.

         As a concept, that is a reflection upon all Australians of Chinese origin who have made a great contribution to this nation. Is she saying that if she had had a serious heart condition when Dr Chang was alive that she would not have been operated on by him because he was Asian?

         In Queensland recently, there was a significant art exhibition of Asian art and culture.

         After the war, if they were Italian or Greek, there were some fairly fanciful names used to describe them. And as these people became part of our community, I had given to me, when I was minister for immigration, an article written in one of the Sydney tabloids. The heading was: `Australia being Latinised'. What had the Italians done? An enterprising reporter had actually been in that part of Sydney where Italian settlers had bought houses. But worse than that, they had actually opened restaurants and, worse again, the menus were in Italian. And Australia was being `Latinised'.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have heard from the member for Oxley that Australia is being `Asianised'. It is palpable nonsense. It is ignorant nonsense. And words hurt. I have in my electorate a significant Jewish community, many of whom were victims of the Holocaust. No&amp;hyphen;one could have foreseen the fact, and Adolf Hitler, whether we like it or not, was democratically elected. What did he do? All the economic problems that then faced the German people were blamed onto one group: the Jews. And what started as words of hatred which were picked up, led to Kristallnacht and to the persecution of that group and, ultimately, to the Holocaust and the destruction of those people.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not saying that is what is contemplated here, but what I am saying is that there is no place in this parliament, no matter how vigorously asserted, or how ignorant the person making the statement is, where you say that you now introduce into your immigration policy a set of standards by which people are excluded on the basis of their country of origin. Australia has moved beyond that. And the kind of allegations that are made by the honourable member for Oxley have no place in this parliament. I do not argue with her right to say them, but they are palpably wrong and immoral.

It was a reference to racism and racist attitudes being shown towards Asian people. And who was quoted? The honourable

         There is one other matter that I feel I should raise, and I can understand the enthusiasm for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He is a political stayer and, as a political stayer, he fought his way through to the highest office in the land. But, equally, this view that he has that somehow his elevation to office has brought a new sense of freedom, and that political correctness—whatever that means—is no longer the order of the day, and that political correctness means that you have to support what are the prevailing views in this society, is wrong. I do not believe that this position was ever part of the Hawke or the Keating governments. And as one who has been in politics some time, I am bound to say that most of that time I would have been regarded by the governments of the day as being politically incorrect.

         I started at an early age of 18 stuffing letterboxes in Richmond and Hawthorn in the anti&amp;hyphen;communist referendum.

         I am bound to say that at the recent protest at Mururoa I was joined by a number of my parliamentary colleagues from the Liberal Party, and I was pleased to see that their presence has now made me politically correct. Equally, I found myself in the situation where I was opposed to the conscription of Australian youth for the war in Vietnam, and that also led to strong allegations that one was disloyal, one was not prepared to stand up to fight the threat of communism. I remember seeing pamphlets in my community saying: better stop them there than have them come here, with a big red arrow not coming out of Vietnam but actually coming out of China. That was a politically incorrect position. It was a minority position in the beginning and ultimately, of course, we were proved right.

         It was the same with apartheid. I remember seeing my fellow citizens being brutally bashed in a legitimate and proper democratic protest on the occasion of the South African rugby tour game taking place in Melbourne.

History has caught up with us and our views have been proved right, and the evidence now being given in South Africa shows just how right it was.

         So this view of political correctness depends upon how you see it. The fact is that in our political life the culture in this parliament has changed. After the Vietnam War I was a lone voice speaking on behalf of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to herbicides. For three years I was pretty much a lone voice because the government did not want to know about it. Experiments that have taken place in America over the last five to 10 years have proved that those concerns are right and that there is a clear correlation between some of the conditions of the children of Vietnam veterans and Vietnam veterans themselves and their exposure to defoliants.

         —Like many on the coalition side, I am a person who is very pleased to be in government after 13 years, but also equally pleased to be associated with this budget, the first Howard&amp;hyphen;Costello budget of the coalition. I know a lot of commentators have said that the budget is strong but fair, and as I go around my electorate and other electorates this has been echoed by the people that I have spoken to. Over the last 13 years they have faced the Labor Party and also faced the neglect of the former government for Australian families who they have purported to represent, who seem, particularly the middle income group, to be going further and further down, getting further and further behind. But at last they have seen some hope in this government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Farmers have also been affected over the last 13 years. Certainly, they had to face droughts and low commodity prices, but the actions of the previous government did not help them. And to small business, who are really the backbone of the economy, it seemed that every time they turned around there was some more tax and more red tape. As I went around the electorate before the last election, and the one before that, small business people were saying, `We are getting older and older, we are working harder when we should be starting to take it easy, and we have a business here which is really our superannuation but no&amp;hyphen;one in their right mind would want to buy.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They were really feeling the brunt of the policies of the previous government. So they were delighted when the coalition was elected and more delighted when they saw the policies put forward by the government. But they are starting to get a bit edgy now because we are having some problems getting those measures through the Senate, even though we have a very large majority in the House of Representatives and, I believe, a mandate from the people to have that legislation passed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Like so many people in the community, I am both angry and disappointed that the Labor government's legacy to this great nation has been a mountain of debt in excess of over $100 billion. It seems to me that Labor governments have this reputation of being large taxers and large spenders, and you need the tax if you are going to spend. I notice the paper put out by one of the senators which says that income in taxes and charges in 1992&amp;hyphen;93 was $95 billion and it had increased to $124 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. That is a rise of 30.9 per cent—and all that money has been spent. If we move to loans, it was $32 billion as at 30 June 1991, it rose to $100 billion at 30 June 1996—and that is all gone. Assets sales over four years—Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank et cetera—totalled $8.68 billion. All that is gone.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The worst part of it was that infrastructure investment in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s was eight per cent of outlays, was down to 4.7 per cent when Mr Keating was appointed Prime Minister and this year—1995&amp;hyphen;96—is down to minus 0.3 per cent. That is a tragedy for our nation and is really something we have to act on very quickly. Of course, it was not only the Federal government that had a problem. We saw what happened in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia and it is starting to happen in Queensland. As I said before, it just seems that when you have Labor governments they like to spend big so they have to tax in a large way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The interest on the debt in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget will cost more than is allocated to defence, education and industry assistance. I am also fairly upset that the coalition has had to start its
        <break page="4975" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         first term trying to claw its way up from the bottom of a deep financial hole dug by the mismanagement of successive Hawke&amp;hyphen;Keating governments. Faced with a budget deficit of $10.3 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, the government has had to embark on a firm fiscal strategy to eliminate the budget deficit in order to secure the financial future of the nation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition has been forced to make some tough and difficult decisions with the goodwill, understanding and cooperation of the Australian people. I must say that, despite the coalition having to take some strong actions, the Australian people—certainly the ones I have spoken to—on both sides of the political fence have said, `It is about time governments were honest with us and told us where we stood. We don't mind bearing the burden as long as we are going to get somewhere at the end of it.' That is the attitude that I have seen in many people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The majority of people have accepted that it was imperative for the new government to take stern fiscal action. The majority of people accept that everyone has been asked to shoulder the burden. They accept the pain, knowing the government's budget strategy to reduce debt will secure a better future for all Australians and for future generations. Some of the people who have come into my office have complained about the problem they are going to face, the cutbacks in their area. I have asked them to consider the situation and said to them, `Do you want to bear some of the short term pain now for the future as an Australian, or do you want to be an Australian who just doesn't care about the future, doesn't care about obtaining work for your children and your grandchildren, the quality of life and the standard of living?'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While most people I have spoken to have not been happy about it, they have agreed that that is the way we ought to be going. All they ask of their government is honesty and they want fair play. They do not want to have one section of the community bear all the load. They want it to be spread right throughout the community. Our government would have been quite irresponsible if it had failed to take firm but fair action to turn around the Australian economy after a decade of economic vandalism. That is what it was that put us in that situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Failure to take this tough, unpopular fiscal decision at the correct time would have condemned the Australian people to a continuing period of rising deficit and debt into the next century—this has been said many times before, but we should keep repeating it; we have to do something and that is why we have to get our legislation through the Senate—it would have exposed them and their families to a bleak future, and applied pressure to interest rates and to jobs growth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Despite the economic mess inherited from the Hawke&amp;hyphen;Keating administration, the Howard government has been able to deliver in full on its key election promises. First of all, it has delivered to families, and families are the cornerstone of our great nation—we know that. We really had to do something for families, which seemed to be falling further and further behind. I do not know, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I know that you would have been aware of this as you went around your electorate—how some of those families survived. People who were earning what once was a really good wage, say, between $30,000 and $40,000 per year, with a few children, were finding that they were slipping back further and further. They were wondering what in the heck was going on and what was causing this. The Howard government has looked into this situation and is trying desperately to help these families.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our young people who are unemployed are being trained and retrained and retrained—for what? There is no real training and no real jobs. The Howard government is trying to do something about this.

       <break page="4976" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have mentioned small business. They just thought that they would have to keep on working until they were carried out in a pine box. There was no way they could retire because no&amp;hyphen;one wanted their business and that is their superannuation. And, of course, there are the elderly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know the Labor Party finds it painful to come to grips with the fact that the first Howard government budget has been a winner, as evidenced by the strong support of the Australian people and the majority of media commentators and economists. The Labor Party's pathetic attempt to attack certain sections of the budget and to resort to a campaign of scaremongering clearly illustrates just how out of touch the Labor Party continues to be with the Australian people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the key promises of the Howard government was the $1 billion family tax initiative, which is being delivered in full, restoring hope and reducing the tax burden on families with children. We have kept faith with the Australian community by keeping our promise to look after the poor and needy by maintaining and enhancing the social security safety net. The people who benefit most are those lower and middle income families with children, a group which, as I said before, was neglected by the previous government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Single income families with several young children will benefit between $40 and $50 extra each fortnight. This will certainly relieve some of the economic pressure. There will be assistance through the taxation system, while low income families will be able to claim the family tax payment through the social security system, paid fortnightly with their family payment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that members on the opposite side of the House would be concerned about what is happening to families in Australia. We have had inquiries into the Child Support Agency and family law. Much needs to be done there; I have spent a great deal of time in my office and I would say the major issues would be the Child Support Agency and family law. This is one of the problems we face in Australia and, I suppose, why our budgets blow out: family breakdown. We have to look seriously—both the government and the opposition—at this problem and see where we are going with it because I do not think we can sustain it too far into the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Small business, which is at the heart of rural and regional Australia, has been given a much needed economic boost in this budget. Small business, as I said before, suffered enormous economic setbacks under Labor policies, which produced record business closures and bankruptcies. I mention the rural sector because if you go to many towns—not even outback towns but regional towns—you will find the shops boarded up and closed. There are many reasons for that and we cannot blame just the economy. It is modern transport and certainly there has been tremendous pressure on those businesses in rural and regional areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The budget has restored incentives for small business; incentives aimed at creating an economic environment in which that important sector can confidently expand and create real jobs and get Australians back to work and be part of an exciting and innovative government program to revamp the nation's traineeship and apprenticeship schemes, which will offer significant working opportunities for young school leavers.

        (1) The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 was introduced by the previous Government without adequate consideration to the administrative burdens imposed by the legislation. For example, in New South Wales the Health Insurance Commission predicted 25000 claims in the first year. In the first three months alone almost twice that number of claims were received. To address the backlog the Health Insurance Commission has put processing staff on overtime and engaged additional (temporary) staff.

        (2) Yes. Amending legislation, supported by all parties, was passed in the current session of Parliament. The amendments to the Act introduce provisions which enable an insurer to release 90 per cent of the compensation amount payable to a claimant, provided the insurer pays over to the Commonwealth the remaining 10 per cent and that the HIC receives the completed Notice of Charge.

However, because the M2 is privately funded it has not been declared part of the National Highway System and is therefore ineligible for Federal funding.

        (1) There is no requirement of employers to take any action with the Jobseeker Diary. The Diary is simply a record of the customer's job search which will be used by the Department to assist in determining whether a customer is satisfying the activity test. Employers will not be required to fill in entries in the Diary.

        A nominal benchmark ranging between seeking 2 and 8 jobs per fortnight was set, based upon the size of the Region's labour force. The greater the labour force, the higher the benchmark. This was then adjusted up or down depending upon the level of unemployment in the Region. Regions of low unemployment were scaled up, high unemployment Regions were scaled down. Regional Managers may adjust their benchmark up or down to take into account regional factors that may not be evident in the data used to derive the benchmark. For example, a major employer may open or close or there may be seasonal influences such as fruit picking and the like. ABS employer data was also supplied to Regional Managers to assist them in assessing the state of their local labour market.

        Following discussions I held with industry in May and June this year, I established two joint Industry/Government Working Groups. The first Group considered the potential economic impact of cooked chicken meat imports as well as any transitional adjustment measures which might be considered. While recognising the difficulties of assessing the economic impact without historical data, the Working Group has estimated that imports could represent from 2% to 5% of total Australian chicken meat consumption.
