                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Strengthening and Modernising Licensing and Other Measures) Bill 2024, with what is called the Customs Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2024. This bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to modernise and strengthen the customs licensing regime and makes amendments to streamline administrative processes, including through the digitisation of forms. The customs licensing regime encompasses depot, warehouse and customs broker licences. The bill also amends the AusCheck Act 2007 to allow for the disclosure of security identity card information to an officer of customs for the purposes of the Customs Act. The Customs Licensing Charges Amendment Bill modernises and streamlines the calculation of depot licence charges alongside the primary changes to the Customs Act by the bill. Amendments to the Customs Licensing Charges Act 1997 will strengthen licence fee compliance by aligning licence renewal payments requirements and calculations across the customs licensing regime. The charges bill will also rectify deficiencies in calculating depot licence renewal fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, these bills introduce a range of sensible changes to simplify and streamline the cross-border trade environment to ensure Australia remains globally competitive, building on the previous coalition government's simplified trade system—STS—reform agenda. That simplified trade system work which was done by the previous coalition government has been incredibly important for driving down the cost of trade, and my hope is the government will continue to drive that STS work and make it a focus and a priority. It needs to work across departments, and coordinating cross-departmental reform can be incredibly challenging unless it's driven by ministers in a very coordinated fashion. My hope is we will see that from the government so that the simplified trade system work—very important micro-economic reform—can continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The customs amendment bill is informed by the recommendations of the review of customs licensing regimes. It was a review that was conducted by the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection in 2015. The scope of the review was to assess all licensing regimes under the Customs Act, including licensing of custom brokers, depots and warehouses. It's also informed by the Australian Border Force's Operation Jardena, which was established in November 2021 to coordinate ABF efforts in combating organised crime in Australia's international supply chains and identify supply chain vulnerabilities to inform longer term supply chain reform. Measures in the bill address some of the identified vulnerabilities that are related to the customs licensing regime. So important work has been done, and now what we're seeing through this bill is that work, work which was done with two important reviews and other work, coming about in these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to reduce red tape and strengthen the integrity of the Australian customs licensing regime are supported by the coalition because we've done a lot of work that has led us here. In conjunction with amendments to modernise and streamline aspects of the licence administration, the amendments strengthen the eligibility to hold a licence and maintain a licence, which ensures the integrity of goods under customs control and that the applicant is adequately able to report, store and move goods under customs control, in line with the obligations of a licence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in the bill are set out thematically according to each part of schedule 1 to the bill. Part 1 enables the digital transformation of depot warehouse and customs broker forms. Part 2 modernises provisions in respect of serving notices for the customs licensing regime. Part 3 modernises the publishing of notices by the Comptroller-General of Customs. Part 4 streamlines the disciplinary and licence cancellation process for licence customs brokers. Part 5 removes restrictions on the eligibility of contractors to be a nominee of a customs broker that is a company or a partnership. Part 6 facilitates the disclosure of information by AusCheck for a purpose or function under the Customs Act. Part 7 strengthens the fit-and-proper-person test in the customs licensing regime, including updating and ensuring that 'management or control' has the same meaning with regard to depots and warehouses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 8 strengthens the criteria for the grant and cancellation of depot and warehouse licences and strengthens integrity controls, such as by extending the powers of authorised ABF officers to give directions to persons operating in a customs licensed place and matters relating to the conditions attached to depot and warehouse licences. Part 9 streamlines and strengthens licence fee compliance by aligning payment and renewal requirements and enhancing suspension and cancellation provisions for non-payments. Part 10 facilitates the surrender of a licence upon request and removes the requirement to return or surrender licences after or when they are in the process of being cancelled. Part 11 provides for the refund of licence charges only where the licence has been voluntarily surrendered. Part 12 enables digitised forms relating to the loading, unloading and use of aircraft and ship stores and for these stores to be taken on board an aircraft or ship. Part 13 enables digitised forms relating to claims for return of seized goods. Part 14 makes amendments in respect of provisions for warehouses licensed under part 5 of the Customs Act and which are contingent on the commencement of the Excise and Customs Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Administration) Act 2024. The bill was introduced in May but has not yet passed, which up-states the drafting of these provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms benefit government by reducing the administrative burden associated with managing the customs licensing regime and strengthening the Border Force's ability to effectively manage threats of criminal organisation infiltration in the supply chain. These are important reforms, and that's why they're getting bipartisan support. As I've said previously, it builds on work done by previous reviews and what the coalition did through its reforms of the simplified trade system. It's good to see, especially in this area, the work that's being done on digitisation and on further streamlining, because the more we can do to simplify trade, red tape and licensing requirements, the better our trade will be and the smoother the customs processes will be, especially for Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said previously, the coalition is happy to support this legislation. It builds on important work that we did in government, and my hope is that, especially when it comes to the simplified trade system, that very important and hard microeconomic reform work will be continued by the government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Amendment (SMS Sender ID Register) Bill 2024. What this bill seeks to do is something very sensible. I think almost all of us, on some occasion, have received a scam text message that pretends to be from someone that it's not. You might get one that says it's from Westpac, HSBC or Telstra, but it's not. That is what is known as spoofing, where scammers put a false identity in the sender line. The idea is to trick people into believing in what's in that message. This bill seeks to create a register that the telecommunications companies would hold such that, if somebody tried to impersonate Westpac, Telstra or whoever, the telecommunications company would see that it wasn't from that company and would block the message from getting through. It's a very sensible proposal. There are a few issues with the bill, which I'll come to in a second, but generally it is sensible and something we support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a quite significant irony here, though. The Labor Party is putting forward a bill about not pretending to be someone you're not in a text message, when probably the single most famous example of this happening in Australia was perpetrated by the Australian Labor Party. It was actually eight years ago today that this happened, and it was something that became known as the 'Mediscare' scandal. Back then, in 2016, the Labor Party sent millions and millions of text messages to Australians, pretending to be from Medicare, and in those text messages they made various political statements. I have one here. It's from Saturday 2 July 2016—eight years ago today—and it says it's from Medicare. It wasn't from Medicare; it was from the Labor Party. It says: 'Mr Turnbull's plans to privatise Medicare will take us down the road of no return. Time is running out to save Medicare.' So this process is called spoofing, and it's something that was pioneered and championed by the Australian Labor Party—so much so that the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, admitted to it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> published a story, just after the 2016 election, about this text message. The story reads:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The election-day text, which said the government planned to wind back Medicare services, appeared to come from "Medicare".</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is a pretty ironic situation, isn't it? The most famous example of what the government is now, sensibly, seeking to stop was perpetrated by the government itself. Minister Rowland, the Minister for Communications, said, quite accurately:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These fraudsters operate domestically and overseas and use sophisticated technologies to trick innocent Australians …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She's right; they do. And probably the biggest one ever was from the Labor Party, but we won't quibble about that. I'm pleased that the Labor Party is seeking to ensure that it can never again do what it did with such enthusiasm in 2016. It's good that they want to legislate to stop that from happening again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few curiosities in the bill. It doesn't say whether the register will be mandatory or voluntary on the part of the telecommunications sector. That's a pretty important point. I believe the sector is open to it being mandatory and is broadly supportive of this legislation, but it's a pretty important point which is missing from the legislation. It also doesn't set a date for when the register will actually start working. Again, that would be good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government announced plans for this in April 2023—that's 16 months ago—and, as we're often seeing in the communications portfolio, there has been a sort of bureaucratic inertia. It's just layer upon layer of roundtables and consultative committees and, generally, not a great deal happening. In April 2023 the government says, 'We're going to do this'; 16 months later the legislation arrives, but then the legislation doesn't actually tell you when it will happen. That suggests it will not be happening for a little while. That is unfortunate, but it is a sensible piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, we've all been recipients of those text messages. Unfortunately, they often target older Australians and people who might be less familiar with how these scams work, who, unfortunately, can be susceptible to responding to some of these text messages. In my own electorate we have seen a shocking example of this, with a scam involving a scammer pretending to be HSBC Bank. This scam has led to numerous people, just in my own electorate, losing up to $50,000 each. I have very serious concerns about the way in which HSBC has responded, or, more frankly, has failed to respond to that scam. I know that the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA, is looking into this very closely, and I look forward to AFCA seeking a resolution—a resolution which is fair to those people who have been scammed out of very significant amounts of money. In some cases, those amounts equal their life savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really serious issue. It's appropriate that the government moves in this area. It has taken too long, but it's better late than never. The coalition will support this legislation, but it is irony upon irony that the greatest perpetrator of scam texts in our history was the Labor Party, through the shocking 'Mediscare' scam. It's pleasing that, under this law, that will be unlawful in the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional Broadcasting Continuity) Bill 2024. Why is this called the 'Regional Broadcasting Continuity Bill'? The reason it's called that is because the continuation of regional broadcasting has just stopped in Mildura. In Mildura, one of our great centres in Australia, as of yesterday, Channel 10 is no longer being broadcast. Channel 10 in Mildura is a joint venture between WIN and Channel 7, and the companies have said that for some years now the cost of running that business has exceeded the revenue, and that they had been trying and trying to come to some sensible resolution with this government which would enable them to continue to broadcast in Mildura. They said that no such resolution—or, frankly, even an idea—was provided by the government and that consequently they have shut down that service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue about Mildura potentially closing has been on the agenda for a very long time. This is not a new issue and it's something that WIN has discussed over a significant period of time. WIN announced that the closure would occur on 30 June. When did the government introduce legislation related to the closure of Mildura, which was slated to occur on 30 June? When did the government actually introduce legislation to deal with this issue? On 26 June—four days before. That's when the government introduced the legislation. And what does the legislation say? It's quite extraordinary legislation, and I'll come to the detail in a moment. But I have here a letter that was sent to the Prime Minister on 18 June and signed by, it appears, all the television networks in Australia. It has Jeff Howard, the chief executive of Seven West Media; Mike Sneesby, the chief executive of Nine; Beverley McGarvey from Channel 10; John Kelly from Southern Cross Austereo; Andrew Lancaster from WIN; Amy Wilshire from Imparja Television; and Bridget Fair from Free TV Australia. Those executives said to the Prime Minister that the closure of Mildura shows that things are getting desperate for regional television in Australia and that they needed his assistance to keep the lights on—to allow those broadcasts to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They talked about the many pressures facing the industry, but what they pointed to in particular was what's known as the commercial broadcasting tax. This is a tax charged by government to broadcasters and it raises about $46 million a year. Because it's charged based on how much of the airwaves you use, regional broadcasters pay a disproportionately large amount—regional broadcasters, obviously, cover large areas and so they pay a disproportionately large amount of this $46 million. The CEOs wrote to the Prime Minister in good faith and said: 'We don't want to close Mildura and we don't want to close other regional broadcasters. What we need is a three-year moratorium on that commercial broadcasting tax.' Of course, that dovetails with policy that's already been announced by the coalition, and in fact it was announced in last year's budget reply back in May, where the Leader of the Opposition said, alongside the reforms that we would introduce to remove gambling advertising from live sport, we would get rid of the commercial broadcasting tax. So one side of politics said, 'Yes, we are going to do this thing that is so important.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the CEOs write their letter in good faith, on 18 June, and, to my knowledge, have not received a substantive response. On 30 June, what happens? Mildura television closes down; Channel 10 closes down. If you live in Mildura today and you try to flick onto Channel 10—nothing, gone. This bill, which the government introduced four days before the closure of the Mildura service, is the government's attempt to address that issue. It is pretty remarkable what the government is suggesting here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does is basically say, 'If you live in Mildura and you can't watch Channel 10, we have a solution for you: you can get a satellite service.' Okay, but there is fine print which is, to get the satellite dish, you have to pay about $800. Imagine you are in Mildura with no more Channel 10. Many people will access it through digital means, but, if you can't access it through digital, you can't access it through the airwaves, because it is no longer there. So what does the government say to you four days before the thing is going to be shut down? 'Go and pay $800, and buy a satellite dish just for the purpose of watching Channel 10.' Look, Channel 10 has a lot of fantastic programming—no doubt—but how many people are going to pay $800 so they can watch <span style="font-style:italic;">Ready Steady Cook</span>? I don't know, but I suspect it is not going to be a large number of people who are going to be particularly excited—<span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Project</span> fans though they may be—to go out and spend $800 on a satellite dish. This is the solution that this government has come up with four days before the switch-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The network CEOs have very clearly stated there is a solution here and it is to provide tax relief on the commercial broadcasting tax, which hits the regionals really hard. If you are a regional broadcaster, obviously it is a much smaller market than if you are broadcasting into Sydney or Melbourne, so you have much lower advertising revenue, but, through this commercial broadcasting tax, you are paying quite a lot of tax. So the broadcasters are saying, 'Give us some relief from that tax.' This government said: 'No, we're not going to do that. What we're going to do is say, "Hey, people of Mildura, why don't you go and spend $800 on a satellite dish just to watch Channel 10? You don't need it for nine or seven or other channels, because they still work, but Channel 10 doesn't."'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mallee, who is in the chamber, I suspect, would have a better idea on this than me, but, if you did a poll on the streets of Mildura and said, 'How do you feel about paying $800 to watch Channel 10?' there would probably not be a lot of enthusiasm. But that is this minister's solution. Her solution is to say to the people of Mildura, 'You can still watch Channel 10, but we want you to pay $800 for a satellite dish, and you only need it for Channel 10 because everything else will continue to work.' That is just very, very concerning. This is in the middle of Labor's cost-of-living crisis. As we know, many people in regional Australia are on lower incomes than people in metropolitan Australia. Who in Mildura has a lazy $800 to spend so they can watch Channel 10? I don't think there would be many people in that position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of foresight, the lack of rigour, the lack of planning, the lack of strategic focus on the part of this government and this minister means we are in this situation in the parliament four days before the switch-off. And, of course, we're only debating it today. It's actually two days after they switched it off, on 30 June. So two days after it's been switched off we're debating what to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free TV has been quite scathing on this. Bridget Fair, always a very passionate advocate for the industry that she represents, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation merely allows Mildura viewers the option of installing a satellite dish at their own expense to receive the remote area VAST service to replace their Network 10 services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While this gives Mildura residents an option to replace their lost services, it is not a fair or reasonable solution, new satellite installation can cost upwards of $800.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to observe, with great clarity:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In a cost-of-living crisis this is simply not realistic for many Australians just to access the television services that are available for free to everyone else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mallee has been articulating with such passion the situation that the residents of Mildura find themselves in, because this is actually unique to Mildura. Now, the fear is—and the CEOs talk about this in their letter—it might not be unique to Mildura in the future; this could easily happen in other country towns. And is the government's response to those towns seriously going to be, 'Hey, pay $800 to get a satellite dish to keep watching Channel 10'? The CEOs, in their letter, talk about the issues that are arising here. They say that we are now in a position where regional licensees have been forced to start turning off unprofitable licences. The shareholders of Mildura Digital Television can no longer subsidise the losses incurred. They also say—and this is an important point. I mentioned before that, unfortunately, Mildura may not be the last. In their letter to the Prime Minister, the CEOs say, 'Decisions such as those in relation to Mildura and other challenged markets can be expected to continue into the future.' So Mildura is not going to be the last, and this proposal is a three-year relief on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is sometimes hard to understand the positions taken by the communications minister on so many different issues. Obviously, it's the judgement of the minister that we talk about here, given that the minister has put this legislation before parliament. As we've seen today widely reported in the media, this is the same minister who welcomed the NBN price increases of up to 14 per cent in eight months as great news for consumers. This is the same minister who, in response to the eSafety Commissioner's call for a trial of age assurance technology to protect children, wrote, in a letter to the Prime Minister in July last year, that that would be an unnecessary distraction, only to adopt that position some nine or 10 months later. It's part of a pattern of very concerning conduct by this minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of the bill which I should mention is a sensible change to enable broadcasters to use effectively less spectrum when they broadcast, should they choose to do so. That is technically not allowed under the rules at present. So what this bill would do is enable that to occur. This is a sensible thing. It's good for the networks, it's good for the government and it's good for the efficient use of spectrum management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very concerning situation. There are some 70,000 viewers in the Mildura region who will no longer be able to see Channel 10, and the minister's response is, 'Pay $800 for a satellite dish.' It's very difficult to understand. I know the member for Mallee will have a lot more to say about this, given that this so directly affects her community. Unfortunately, this same issue may affect other regional communities in the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">WEBSTER</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional Broadcasting Continuity) Bill 2024. Mildura and the wider Sunraysia region are ground zero for the vanishing future of regional free-to-air television broadcasting, which is in stark contrast to the trailblazing position Labor claimed Mildura held back in 2010—more on that in a moment. The 1 July closure of Mildura Digital Television Pty Ltd and, thereby, the transmission of Channel 10 and affiliate channel content must become a critical juncture for regional television in our nation, and it demands more than a bandaid. Regional Australians need and deserve a comprehensive long-term strategy to secure sustainable regional broadcasting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mildura residents can no longer watch Channel 10 or its Bold and Peach channels on free-to-air television, as Mildura Digital Television has now shut down. <span style="font-style:italic;">MasterChef</span> is off the menu, and Mildura is sadly and undeservedly in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cheap Seats</span>. One constituent who rang my office was quite emotional. No longer will she be able to watch <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Bold and the Beautiful</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad reality of this unwanted first is that, in 2010, the Sunraysia region welcomed the then communications minister Stephen Conroy, who read out the countdown for gathered media as Sunraysia became the first region in Australia to switch from analogue to digital. On board the PS <span style="font-style:italic;">Mundoo</span> paddleboat—a fabulous paddleboat in the Mildura region—Minister Conroy, on loudspeaker over the phone, told technician Rob Kovac at Yatpool to flick the switch to switch off the analogue signal. As the analogue screen flicked to white noise, Minister Conroy then said, 'Today, Mildura makes history again as it becomes the first region in Australia to make the switch to digital-only TV.' How sad that just 14 years later Mildura takes the unwanted first of being the first in the nation to switch off a digital TV signal. Indeed, Sunraysia residents are now the first in the country to cease having access to one of the nation's five major television channels. It's little wonder that the Labor spin doctors have called this bill a continuity bill. The only continuous thing from this government is weakness, incompetence and robbing regions to buy votes in the inner cities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I raised the alarm about Mildura Digital Television's decision when I first heard about it in early May. I wrote to the communications minister, Minister Rowland, asking for assistance or intervention, bearing in mind that some of our older viewers may not have had the TV to access the digital alternative or may not have the digital literacy to do so. The panellists on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Project</span> expressed similar concerns on Sunday night. I also spoke to both WIN, who co-own the Mildura digital TV operation, and Channel 10. In a peculiar arrangement, 10 are powerless to stop their programs from going off air due to a decision by the co-owners of MD TV's affiliates, Seven and Nine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A constituent wrote to me about the loss of Channel 10 locally. She said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a long-time viewer, I am deeply distressed by this decision, as it impacts not only me but also many other residents in the area who rely on Channel Ten for news, entertainment and community connection.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second constituent is right about a cascade of changes that will follow, as we saw with bank branches. Free TV Australia has called for reform to establish a stable, long-term footing for regional television broadcasting. As regional Australians begin to lose access to television services, the availability of local trusted news, local advertising opportunities for regional businesses and Australian content in regional areas are all under threat. Most regrettably, Mallee knows this all too well. Mallee has not one single television journalist or news service presented in the region. I remind the House that that is over one-third of the geographical area of Victoria. On the Mildura Digital Television shutdown, Free TV CEO Bridget Fair told ABC Mildura-Swan Hill: 'This has been a long time coming and the government has been aware of it, so they should have maybe had a bit more time to come up with a plan.'</span>

                    </a>  Yes; four days is all we got. This bill before the House today merely allows Mildura viewers the option of installing a satellite dish—at their own expense—to receive the remote area VAST service to continue receiving Network 10 services. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunraysia </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily</span>, a local newspaper, generously called the minister's bill 'a last-ditch effort to provide access to the Channel 10 broadcast'. Sure, this bill gives Mildura residents what you could describe as a technical option to replace their lost services, but it is neither a fair nor reasonable solution. The cost of a new satellite installation, which is up to $800, is simply not realistic for many Australians, especially in a cost-of-living crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without urgent substantive action by the government, more regional digital transmission areas are likely to cease. Over the past five years, regional broadcasting has been the subject of numerous detailed government reviews, but we still have no plan from the Albanese Labor government to ensure a long-term sustainability of this critical media sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional commercial broadcasters spend millions on local content every year and comply with significant local news content quotas that do not apply to any other platform. In the financial year 2023, they spent $35 million on local news bulletins—$5 million more than the previous year. Regrettably, Mallee voters don't see the benefit of that as there are no local commercial TV news journalists or bulletins. Even so, while Mildura has taken the first hit in this latest round of signal closures, this is about regional Australia because the Nationals stand for regional Australia. All commercial television broadcasters also comply with additional regulatory requirements, such as the 55 per cent Australian content obligation and accessibility requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the public interest benefits they deliver, Australian commercial television broadcasters pay the highest spectrum taxes in the world—known as the commercial broadcasting tax here in Australia. This tax is a significant impost on regional broadcasters' ability to fund content and infrastructure costs. The commercial broadcasting tax was introduced as a temporary measure in 2017 and, as the shadow minister has outlined, should have been abandoned years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Solutions to keeping the lights on for regional TV are squarely in the hands and control of the Albanese Labor government. The coalition did its part during COVID-19 with the Public Interest News Gathering program, or PING, to help regional media, including regional television, to apply for grants totalling $50 million in value to help with staff wages, training technology or website upgrades. The coalition also provided spectrum tax-fee relief for 12 months to assist the regional media sector from 2020 to 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional television now needs direct funding support for markets where services are not commercially viable. Regional and remote communities are now faced with the equivalent of a mobile black spot—call it a 'broadcasting black spot', if you like. The federal government provides funding for commercial telecommunications operators to ensure locals can receive their signal, yet this government has not ensured that regional Australians can continue to have access to high-quality TV services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional broadcasters know their audiences love local news, community stories and sport, and that local businesses need regional TV to reach local customers. Without the government's long-term support, more services are at risk and the social and economic benefits for regional Australia will be lost.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me touch on the role of the ABC. As some members might be thinking, they are there to fill gaps like the one created by the demise of Mildura Digital Television and the Channel 10 signal in Sunraysia. The ABC's resourcing in regional Australia is problematic. One of the upsides of commercial broadcasters is that they get direct feedback on profit-and-loss statements, whether their content is fit for purpose and whether their local regional audiences like what they're broadcasting. If advertisers love your local content, they will advertise. If they hate it, they stop paying the bill. It is the best market-driven way of ensuring accountability to your local audience. Arguably, the ABC lacks that form of direct accountability, so the ABC is not adequate as the fallback solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with Minister Rowland's advisers last week alongside the shadow minister for communications, David Coleman, about the Mildura situation. Despite our efforts, Mildura Digital Television is committed to their closure decision, as we know—it's happened—saying the federal government's commercial broadcasting tax was a major contributing factor. For Channel 10 viewers in Mildura, the signal went off air on 30 June. The coalition is committed to reforming our television arrangements. Shadow minister Coleman and I have discussed policies to support regional broadcasting, including the abolition of the commercial broadcasting tax. In 2023, TV broadcasters were forced to pay over $44 million for this tax that disproportionately affects regional broadcasters, as he outlined. Eliminating this tax will allow broadcasters to invest more in local staff and programs for regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government yet again is robbing regions to buy votes in the inner cities, leaving regional Australia to wither on the vine. The Prime Minister's weak leadership sees the surging power of Meta, Google and social media platforms going unchecked, pushing their content and ideological agenda onto Australians as their primary source of entertainment and news. These foreign giants' unchecked market power is also a major factor in commercial TV's struggle for advertising revenue. Indeed, Bridget Fair, the Free TV Australia CEO, also told ABC Radio in Mildura: 'We've got more competition for eyeballs. Obviously, people are watching streaming and other services, and our services are required to be funded by advertising dollars.' As that becomes more difficult to generate with more competition, it means there will be more challenges for regional television operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has led the way on holding the social media giants to account, establishing the eSafety Commissioner and putting forward reforms to control online content in the national interest, proposing age verification to protect children online. The communications minister has only recently realised the need for action. As the Mildura Digital TV shutdown date loomed, one Mallee resident said: 'Country people need to be able to source information and programs from all free-to-air channels. Surely the government can ensure these things are freely available to not only city but country people. Once again, we are the forgotten electors.' The right to access reliable news, local stories and entertainment should not be a privilege based on geography. The digital divide between city and country must be addressed to guarantee that all Australians, regardless of where they live, have equitable access to the same television services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's neglect of regional Australians is glaring. The needs and rights of regional Australians cannot continue to be overlooked. It is a matter of equity—something this government talks a lot about. The government has a responsibility to ensure that regional communities are not left behind, particularly in an era where information is power. The closure of Mildura Digital Television is a stark reminder of the disparities that still exist. We must ensure that regional voices are heard and that the essential services they rely on are protected and sustained.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  I rise also to speak on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional Broadcasting Continuity) Bill 2024. I do it with a heavy heart. It's the diminishing of regional TV. It's the diminishing of regional choices. And it's another indication that, when it comes to regional Australia, this Labor government just doesn't get it, whether it be WA sheep farmers, irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin or people who live in regional cities who want infrastructure. You can't have a government that just focuses on cities and doesn't care about regions, and, unfortunately, that's what we've got. This isn't a huge example of that but it is an example of that, and it's really disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to support the member for Mallee, who just spoke, and her community in Mildura and surrounds. The loss of any free-to-air broadcasting in a regional area is a poor outcome for the industry, for viewers and for choice. Mildura Digital Television, which carried the Channel Ten signal to 70,000 viewers in Mildura, stopped transmitting on 30 June. MDT, jointly operated by WIN and the Seven network, first went to air in January 2006, but it has run at a loss and the decision was made to wind it up. Without any federal assistance to keep it going, the licence has been handed in. Viewers in Mildura now have to use the 10Play streaming app to watch the shows they previously watched free-to-air—and that's if they have the technology, the know-how and internet bandwidth to stream. Not everyone has that, particularly in regional areas. This bill is a response to the situation in Mildura, but it isn't the long-term solution we need and it isn't the long-term solution to the challenges faced by regional broadcasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this bill do? It amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radio Communications Act 1992 to support continued access to television broadcasting services in regional Australia by permitting viewers to access government funded viewer-access satellite television—VAST—or the VAST safety net when a commercial television broadcaster ceases to provide terrestrial services in a given area. That's the case in Mildura, where the Seven and Nine signals will continue to be broadcast but Channel 10 and its secondary channels will no longer be broadcast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is VAST? Viewer access satellite television fills gaps in regional Australia where there is no reception or there is very poor reception. Anyone wishing to access VAST needs to purchase a VAST approved satellite set-top box and a satellite dish of at least 65cm diameter. The cost is from around $500 for a dish-and-receiver bundle, plus installation. It's a popular service for many grey nomads, but the portable systems with automatic tracking can cost many thousands of dollars. While creating access to VAST in the Mildura scenario means that viewers can continue to receive terrestrial broadcasts for all channels, they face additional imposts in costs and technological challenges. Therefore, they aren't receiving equality of access with other people in Australia—for example, people who live in cities or even in regional cities. Some might argue it's a cost associated with living in rural and remote parts of Australia. But Mildura is a regional city on the Victorian-New South Wales border; it's a significant city and I think its people deserve the same sort of access, the equality of access, to terrestrial broadcast television that other Australians have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for this impost on viewers isn't remoteness or reception; it's a partial failure of the aggregated regional TV market. Continuing to broadcast at a loss was uneconomic for the broadcast licence holder, and hopefully this is a one-off. But, as a parliament, we can't afford to just hope it doesn't happen again to another regional community. It has happened to the member for Mallee. I'm her next-door neighbour in Nicholls, and I have some regional areas that might suffer from this in the future. Or it could spread to Indi. All of us in regional areas suffer consistently from this inequality and the perception that the government somehow thinks we don't count as much as people who live in cities do. Thanks to this bill, the Mildura example now has a name: it's a declared 'service deficient area'. Decoded, that means some of the channels which viewers should ordinarily receive free-to-air will no longer be available for them. I think we should seek to avoid this situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way to do that, the long-term solution, is to make regional broadcasting viable. This bill removes impediments to commercial television broadcasters consolidating their terrestrial transmission arrangements and, in certain circumstances, breaking the one-on-one relationship between broadcasting and transmitter licences. This will allow broadcasters to pursue more efficient and cost-effective transmission arrangements. The industry view is that these are tweaks rather than real reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free TV, which represents regional television broadcasters, has called for a comprehensive four-step plan to put regional television broadcasting on a sustainable long-term footing. What is at stake here is access to services, particularly trusted local news; local advertising opportunities; and access to major sports and cultural broadcasts. That's so important because traditionally in Australia we have come together around sporting and cultural broadcasts—all sorts of sporting broadcasts, such as the Melbourne Cup, the Olympics and the AFL grand final. Some of those, obviously, are on channels that will still be broadcasting terrestrially in Mildura, but Channel 10 had some of those too. So there is an issue with access to sporting broadcasts into the future. Abolishing the spectrum tax is one of the suggested measures to reduce costs for regional broadcasters, and it's a cost-saving measure that the coalition supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have lost so much of what we had in regional television, and I think we need to protect what we have left. Three years after television had launched in metropolitan Sydney and Melbourne, the first regional station started broadcasting. The first to launch was TVT6 in Hobart in May 1960 and then GLV10 in Traralgon in December 1961. That's so long ago that my friend the member for Gippsland wasn't even born—wasn't even watching.</span>

                    </a>  It is; I agree. A few days later, very personal for me, it was GMV6 in Shepparton. I can remember waking up to GMV6 <span style="font-style:italic;">Six's Super Saturday Show</span>. We only had two channels when I was young: Channel 3, which was the ABC, and Channel 6, which was GMV6. You'd watch the cartoons in the morning, <span style="font-style:italic;">Six's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Super Saturday Show</span>, and then at night you'd watch whatever good American TV was imported then—<span style="font-style:italic;">The A-Team </span>or <span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">HiPS</span>. It was part of our childhood, it was great stuff and I really enjoyed it, and we want the same access for young people growing up now. I understand things are a bit different. I have conversations with my kids about streaming. But free-to-air television is still important for a number of families, particularly lower socioeconomic families in regional areas, where streaming is more difficult. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional television is part of our lives, and we're tempted to take it for granted, but we shouldn't. Local content has diminished over the years. Local news has consolidated, and that's disappointing. That has an effect on democracy. We used to have GMV6 News and then WIN News, which would report on local issues, it would report on what local councils were doing and it would report on what state politicians were doing and how they were representing their community. Those services have been significantly diminished, and I don't think that's good for our democracy. Now in Mildura the transmission of a whole network is ceasing because it's financially unviable. That impacts access and choice, it deepens the divide between city and country, and it's exactly why the Nationals continue to stand up for regional Australia, where people deserve equity of access regardless of where they live. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often say in this place that your postcode shouldn't define a number of things—your access to education and to all number of services. It shouldn't define your access to the free-to-air television that people in the cities are getting. We are one country. We used to be more cohesive when we all got around the water cooler and discussed what we saw on the TV last night. I know things have changed, but equitable access to free-to-air television for people across Australia, including in regional Australia, is a really important thing that this parliament should be trying to facilitate. </span>

I'm very pleased I was able to be in the chamber to hear the words of the member for Nicholls. It was enlightening. I think there were two things in particular that the member for Nicholls said that are worth reiterating—first, that free-to-air broadcasting is special. It is special. It is the stable, free and ubiquitous platform that means that people in both metropolitan areas and rural and regional Australia have access to that, and I thank the member for bringing that to the attention of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member also drew attention to the fact that the diminution of services in regional Australia—consolidation, loss of news—has been occurring over a long period of time, which is very true. That's why it is necessary to understand that we are unfortunately in a situation where we've inherited an analogue era of regulation that needs to be updated for the future. We have legislation before the parliament to do that, and, at the same time, we need to appreciate the ongoing commercial decisions and the circumstances in which these regional broadcasters find themselves. But I thank the member for Nicholls for his very thoughtful contribution. I look forward to engaging with him on how regional communications—not only broadcasting but also broadband and telecommunications services more generally—can be enhanced for the benefit of his constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very pleasing to see strong support across the parliament for measures that enhance access to free-to-air broadcasting services in regional and remote Australia. The Albanese government is committed to ensuring that all Australians have equitable access to high-quality television broadcasting services. This bill will make a small but meaningful contribution to that outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The broadcasting sector faces particular challenges in regional areas, as the closure of Mildura Digital Television, MDT, makes clear. This bill responds to two recent developments, raised chiefly by the actions of regional broadcasters, and presents practical measures for regional broadcasting: firstly, the May 2024 decision by the board of MDT to cease operations from 1 July 2024 and, secondly, the April 2024 consolidation by WIN Television of the services it provides under two commercial TV licences in the SA licence areas of Mount Gambier / South East TV1 and Riverland TV1.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to close MDT is a very disappointing commercial decision of the free-to-air broadcasters WIN and Seven Network to close their joint venture, which provided Network Ten services in the Mildura/Sunraysia TV1 licence area. The decision, as I said, underscores the significant structural issues that are affecting the provision of digital terrestrial broadcasting services in regional Australia, which is why the government has introduced legislation to expand access to the Viewer Access Satellite Television, or VAST, service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">VAST is a taxpayer-funded safety net which ensures that Australians in regional or remote communities without adequate terrestrial broadcasting can continue to access free-to-air television via satellite. The safety net supports the provision of free-to-air commercial television to over 1½ million Australians. It is a Labor initiative, and the government has extended funding to continue VAST across regional and remote Australia for an additional seven years to 2030-31.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has moved swiftly to address the two recent issues, which I mentioned, that impact regional Australia. We briefed the shadow minister and the member for Mallee ahead of bill introduction last week so the opposition would be in a position to facilitate prompt passage of the legislation on a bipartisan basis. If the coalition choose to delay this bill or refer it to a committee, that is their prerogative, but I would note that any delay to the passage of this legislation would do the following: it would increase the time that the residents of Mildura are unable to access the option of the VAST safety net, and it will increase the time that WIN is potentially in breach of its licence conditions and other regulatory obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure of MDT reflects the difficulties of operating commercial broadcasting and transmission services in the contemporary media environment, and it demonstrates, as I said, the consequences of a decade of inaction in the way of meaningful media reform under the previous government. The former government, in 2017, declared that their media reforms heralded a new era for the media, yet regional broadcasting remained significantly challenged. To quote a media release dated 14 September 2017, entitled 'A new era for Australia's media', the Prime Minister at the time, Malcolm Turnbull, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government is strengthening Australia's media industry, enhancing media diversity and securing local journalism jobs, particularly in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Flash forward to 8 May 2024, when the shadow minister and the member for Mallee issued a media release about the closure of MDT and, of all things, poked fun at the issues facing regional Australians and the closure of MDT as they did so. This media release entitled 'Sevenwest and WIN tell Mildura "get me out of here"' responds to the closure of MDT with a series of thoughtless puns about various 10 programs. Even now, this unedifying media release remains available on the member for Mallee's website.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have extended to the member for Mallee the courtesy of briefings as well as advice on issues affecting broadcasting services in her electorate, including notification in February this year of an upgrade of services from MPEG-2 to MPEG-4. I will give the member the benefit of the doubt; she hasn't been here as long as some others. She wasn't here for the coalition's repeal of the two-out-of-three cross media rule, unlike the shadow minister. But it does demonstrate that the coalition, or some in it, are not taking this issue as seriously as they should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the closure of MDT has been under contemplation for some time. In fact, I understand the matter was brought to the attention of the former minister for communications in the coalition government, but he failed to engage on the matter. If this is true, this is something that no doubt an inquiry into this bill might bring to light, and I welcome it. By contrast, my office and my department have engaged with MDT several times to discuss their plans. I have engaged with the parties to support an orderly wind-down that communicated the decision to the affected audience and advised them of alternative ways of accessing the 10 service. And, as I said, the Albanese government has introduced legislation into parliament precisely so the residents of Mildura have the choice of accessing the VAST service so they may receive the full suite of television broadcasting services by satellite if they choose to do so. If a resident of Mildura takes up the VAST option, they will have access to a full suite of those services, more than just the 10 services. But consumers do have choice, and many residents in Mildura with an internet connection may choose to watch 10 content over the 10 Play app. Because of the Albanese government's commitment to improving connectivity in the regions, many more residents of Mildura will be able to exercise this option. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to inform the House that an additional 16,500 residents of Mildura are now able to access high-speed broadband, supported by the Albanese government's investment of $2.4 billion to give an additional 1.5 million premises full-fibre access, and that includes more than 660,000 additional premises in rural and regional Australia. This investment is boosting the reliability of broadband services and the productivity of businesses, supporting the way we now work, study and transact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the shadow minister mentioned the commercial broadcasting tax. He said this tax hits regional broadcasters hard. For the record, the commercial broadcasting tax was introduced by a coalition government. It is a Liberal-National party tax, and the shadow minister was a member of the government that introduced this tax. In recognition of the challenges facing regional broadcasters, the Albanese government has already extended and increased the commercial broadcasting tax rebate, which means regional broadcasters pay less tax for the spectrum they use. Under the Albanese government, the rebate for the broadcasting tax has been extended and increased for the first time since the coalition introduced it in 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the opposition have indicated they would remove the CBT. As has been reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> in May 2023 the opposition wrote to broadcasters offering to remove the commercial broadcasting tax in exchange for the removal of wagering advertising during the broadcast of sport. So it would be misleading for the opposition to now claim they are removing the commercial broadcasting tax to support regional outcomes when their purpose was to make up for lost wagering revenue. I think those opposite need to understand that the CBT can only be offset once, and I look forward to the opposition policy on how spectrum will be valued in Australia. I'm sure the telco industry and all of industry will be very interested to understand this too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that isn't all we're doing for the media sector when it comes to significant reforms and, indeed, when it comes to this bill. We have funded the regulator, the ACMA, to intimate a new Media Diversity Measurement Framework. We've introduced genuine media reforms into the parliament to modernise Australia's analogue-era broadcasting laws with the Communications Legislation Amendment (Prominence and Anti-siphoning) Bill 2024, which will support access to free local TV on connected devices and free sports coverage in the streaming era. We've consulted publicly on the News Media Assistance Program, and my department has analysed submissions and is working across government to consider a range of measures to support the sustainability of the sector and media diversity. This is in addition to stable funding to ensure regional Australians continue to receive the ABC and SBS services, as well as community radio broadcasting, after a decade of cuts and uncertainty under the coalition. That's in addition to our funding for the AAP and over 200 regional and local independent newspaper publishers under the Regional and Local Newspaper Publishers program, as well as a journalist fund supporting cadets in the regions. Unlike the former coalition government, who wasted a decade, ignored regional broadcasters and now make light of this service closure, this government takes the issues facing regional Australia and broadcasters seriously. We're working hard to fix the mess that the coalition left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill will make amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act to expand access to the government funded viewer access satellite television service for Australians living in areas where there has been a material reduction in the number of commercial television broadcasting services provided terrestrially. Although we know that these amendments to the Radio Communications Act adjust the licensing framework that applies to broadcasters, there is a strict one-to-one relationship between the broadcasting licences that authorise broadcasting services and the transmitter licences that authorise the use of radio communications equipment. Although this remains suitable in many circumstances, it won't permit broadcasters to pursue more innovative and efficient ways of delivering their services, should they wish to do so. That is why this bill will also address this anomaly and allow the ACMA to declare that a specified transmitter licence is taken to authorise the operation of one or more radio communications transmitters for transmitting the services authorised under two or more broadcasting licences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures will ensure Australians can continue to access television broadcasting services in the circumstances where outdated regulations would otherwise prevent it. This is important for consumers and industry, and it will support the government's objective of providing equitable access to media services for all Australians, irrespective of where they live or what they earn. I call on members to support the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I said when I finished last night that I would be back soon with a different tie—and so it has come to pass! I'll perhaps precis my remarks of last night, given that they were very short. You can do a lot in two minutes, but not do justice to this bill. This new criminal law will ban non-consensual sharing of deepfake pornography. It's necessary as a consequence of the time we live in and the acceleration of technology, particularly artificial intelligence technologies. This new law will make it a criminal offence to share deepfake porn of someone without their consent. It does seem bizarrely unnecessary that such a law is required, if any sense of common decency could be relied upon. But here we are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Digitally created and altered sexually explicit material is a damaging form of abuse and is accelerating. It's most often used against women and girls but it can be weaponised against anyone. There's been an explosion and a proliferation of artificial intelligence and online technologies, which has made this bill urgent. Anyone who is reasonably digitally literate now, so I'm told—just to reassure you, Deputy Speaker Vasta, and the House, this is not something I have direct familiarity with, but we are told that anyone with a modicum of technical ability can now undertake these activities. It is a high-priority reform for the government and is part of a suite of reforms to tackle online harms, and I'm glad to see ongoing, increasingly urgent action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all the many benefits of technology—we can name them and talk about them at length—there are also, apparently, many negatives such as scams, deepfakes and the growing recognition of the mixed benefits of social media and the harms that are occurring. Sexually explicit deepfakes, shared without the consent of the people depicted, are being used to degrade and dehumanise other Australians—especially to target women, to perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and, so the experts tell us, to drive gender based violence; hence action is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of questions. I posted something on various social media platforms a few weeks ago when we announced this, and on the rare occasion you get a couple of minutes to have a look at what some of the—there are always a bunch of silly comments and conspiracy theories, such is the world we live in, but there are some genuine questions people who have an interest in this and are trying to work out what it means are posing. There is a set of questions about what deepfakes are, and it's worth recording this: deepfakes, as this bill provides, are images, videos or sound files, often generated using AI, of a real person that have been edited to create realistic but false depictions of them doing or saying something they did not actually say or do. Deepfakes can create, as we're seeing across the world, entirely new content or manipulate existing content using a large number of photos or recordings of a person. The risks of abuse are growing as the tools to create deepfakes become more accessible. That's the general definition of deepfakes. But this bill doesn't cover all deepfakes; it just covers sexually explicit deepfakes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question, which people, perhaps peculiarly, with various different intents may ask and have asked, is: will this bill cover sexually explicit deepfakes of famous people or just of people they know? The answer to that is that it will cover both. The new offences cover where a person shares a sexually explicit deepfake of a real person either knowing the person has not consented or being reckless as to whether they have consented or not. This is regardless of who the real person is and whether—this is really important—they're personally known to the offender, to the person sharing this deepfake material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a number of comments I saw, people were asking, 'Will this cover electoral fraud or other kinds of scams?' The answer is no. This bill is particularly and solely focused on the non-consensual sharing of sexually explicit deepfakes online. It will only apply if the deepfakes are sexually explicit. There is, of course, a set of broader concerns, and we're seeing them play out in various elections around the world now—and no doubt it will be an issue for us in the next set of elections we face in this country. It is a set of broader and legitimate concerns in our democracy about the use of deepfake technology. It's not just politicians; those who want to undermine trust in our institutions can deploy this technology across all spheres of our society. But this is not what this bill is focused on; it is focused on sexually explicit deepfakes that are doing so much harm, particularly to young women and girls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is then the question: does this bill cover the mere creation of deepfakes? The answer to that, which some may be a little confused by, is no. It's not actually the creation; it's the non-consensual sharing that this bill criminalises. The offences in the bill apply to the sharing of non-consensual deepfake sexually explicit material online. Where the person also created the deepfake that is shared without consent, there's an aggravated offence which carries a higher penalty of up to seven years imprisonment. So an aggravated offence is there; if you create and share without consent, there's a higher penalty. But, arguably, just the creation alone is not something that the Commonwealth can criminalise. It's important to ensure that the new offences are legally robust and that they have a sound basis in the constitutional powers of the federal parliament. The Commonwealth's power to legislate does not extend to the mere creation of sexually explicit adult deepfakes; presumably, that's something the states and territories would have to deal with. There are state and territory laws that may well apply to the creation of deepfakes in different ways in the different states and territories, but the Commonwealth does have the constitutional power to deal with sharing of non-consensual material over telecommunications networks and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Criminal Code currently criminalises the sharing of private sexual material online. But the definition of 'private sexual material' is potentially limiting and doesn't explicitly extend to artificially generated material, such as deepfakes—hence the legal grey zone, with regard to which this bill makes absolutely clear. The bill proposes to repeal the existing offence related to private sexual material and replace it with a new offence that applies where a person transmits the material using a carriage service—one of those traditional Commonwealth heads of power—and the material depicts: a person who is, or who appears to be, 18 years of age or older; a person engaging in a sexual pose or sexual activity; or sexual organs—or, if we're going into great detail, the anal region of a person or a female's breast—and the person knows that the person depicted does not consent to the transmission of the material, or is reckless as to whether the other person consents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I touched on one of these items before, but the bill introduces two aggravated offences which apply increased penalties to the offence in two circumstances: firstly, before the commission of the underlying offence, three or more civil penalty orders were made against the person for contraventions of relevant provisions of the Online Safety Act 2021; and, secondly, where the person was responsible for the creation or alteration of the sexual material transmitted. The government argues—and I hope that every member of the House agrees—that these amendments are essential to ensure that offences can apply both to real material, such as unaltered images and recordings, and to fake or doctored material that has been created or altered using technology such as deepfakes. The new offences, just to be clear again, will not cover private communications between consenting adults or interfere with private sexual relationships. We don't seek to criminalise consenting human sexuality with this; it's the non-consensual sharing of deepfake material that's of great concern to the Australian people and to the parliament—and particularly to parents, who are grappling with the impacts of this technology and the use, abuse and misuse of this in relation to teenagers. The offences will only apply to material depicting, or appearing to depict, adults. The Criminal Code continues to criminalise the use of carriage services for child abuse material, including child abuse material generated by AI. But of course there are various definition issues, so this complements the existing laws in relation to child abuse material.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very happy to keep talking, but I might check at this point, given we have six minutes to go, if we have another speaker. We do. Great—I always love hearing from the member for Forrest!</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  As has been said, the coalition supports the intentions behind the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024, as would, I think, every member of the House as we deal with some of the multitude of risks that we see online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that there will be serious and damaging consequences to people through AI generated sexual material; it knows almost no bounds in this space. There is a proliferation of artificial intelligence that creates just extraordinary possibilities. It is, in some ways, so useful, but it comes with enormous risks, particularly when we're talking about young people. The risk we are dealing with here arises from that intersection of AI with its tremendous capability to generate material that actually appears to be real. But this will bring an extraordinary capacity to inflict real harm by distributing sexual material online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've delivered hundreds of cybersafety presentations to young school children, and teenagers as well. I've listened to what they've already had to deal with, with their faces—without the AI piece, just their faces—being replaced on other bodies and used in a sexual way. The harm that has caused them and the distress it has brought to them and their families was done even without AI. So in this space, the non-consensual sharing of deepfakes and sexual content is extraordinarily dangerous in my view. It's dangerous to the individual, and dangerous more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this bill will replace some of the existing laws. We certainly took these laws very seriously when in government. Technology has constantly changed and will keep changing. There was a real need for our Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images ) Act in 2018. We really needed that very effective civil take-down capability. One of the most common things for parents who ring my office—because they know of my work in this space—is that they want material removed very quickly. That's the first thing: they don't want it shared, they don't want it to go viral and they're panicking. Often, if it's a young child, that's their greatest worry—and the risk of that child being bullied as a result of that content being online, or being out there when they don't know about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a lot of work in this space previously, but I am concerned about the current bill and the removal of the current definition of 'consent'. Currently, the law says explicitly that consent means 'free and voluntary agreement'. But government has actually removed that definition. There are just a few issues with that—given the real focus on the need to keep people safe and what will happen in the AI generated world. How will the courts adjudicate the consent rule if it's not clearly defined in the legislation? That's what we're going to need, and that's what those who seek to use these laws will need: very clear definitions. The courts will need those as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have also announced a real plan to lift the minimum age for kids accessing social media from 13 to16. It is a top priority for us and it's very important that this is the case. Members have recently heard Meta giving evidence at hearings, where there was a claim made that there's no damage being done to young people on their platforms or in this social media space. Well, from my years of doing this, let me tell you that I have seen a significant deterioration in the mental and emotional health and wellbeing of young people because of what's happening online and on social media. So I don't swallow that for a minute. Every one of those social media platforms creates a harmful place for young people—even for adults as well—and certainly could in the deepfake non-consensual sharing of sexual images. Ever since the inception of online social media platforms, the creators and executives in charge of these platforms decided—apparently, because of what we've seen since—that it was perfectly fine to expose our very young children to what I see as, and it really is, a free-for-all in an online paedophiles' paradise. That's what this is. That's what they have done. Who would have thought there'd be a platform that allowed our children to be groomed online by sexual predators and exposed to extreme and violent pornography—because that's what's happening—and to be exposed randomly to billions of people of all ages on the internet? But that's what the platforms allow. It is part of these platforms' business model and is what is available to very vulnerable young people—</span>

What better way is there than to travel 7½ thousand kilometres away to Taiwan and compete in an international tournament hosted by the Chinese Taipei School Sport Federation? That's exactly what Coomera Anglican College from my electorate of Forde did recently. The team, led by coach Frank Goldfinch, assistant coach Christiaan van Peppen and manager Anthony Hall, included a talented roster of 12 players, in years 9 to 11. The students participated in the opening ceremony and attended a gala dinner, where they performed their college war cry. A representative of the school said: 'This journey allowed our athletes to engage in diverse cultural programs and ceremonial festivities, broadening their horizons both on and off the court. The boys had the time of their lives, made new friends and experienced another country's culture. The experience has considerably contributed to their personal and athletic growth.' What an incredible experience for these students to undertake. It provided them with a chance not only to compete at a high level but to experience what sport has the great power to bring right across the world. Congratulations to everyone involved. </span>

Anyone who dined at Chan's restaurant knows what a fine host he and his wife, Jenny, have been. You are always treated specially, like old friends and members of their family. But this era has come to an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">James Chan in every way is an Australian success story. He has worked hard, treated people fairly, won the respect of all and served his community. James's community service was recognised in 2014 when he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. The citation for his medal reads 'For services to the Chinese community of Greater Western Sydney'. The citation is true and accurate but, I would argue, perhaps too narrow. This is because James's influence, generosity to local charities and contributions extend far beyond Western Sydney. I think here particularly of James's involvement for years as a chairman of the Australian Chinese Buddhist Society. I wish James, Jenny and their children, Beverley and Anthony, every best wish for the future. The restaurant may close, but our friendship won't, nor will James's ongoing commitment and service of his community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  The Growing Regions Program has been a disappointment for Mayo. When first announced, we were disappointed that large swathes of the electorate were no longer eligible. Raising the rural and regional classification of the electorate with the minister fell on deaf ears. Our disappointment was compounded when we learnt that not only was much of the electorate ineligible but only 40 out of 311 suitable applications were successful, with only one very deserving application in Mayo. The total value of the 311 suitable applications exceeded $1.4 billion, of which the 40 successful applications comprised just $206 million, leaving an underspend of $93 million. Considerable effort, time and money is invested by councils and community groups when preparing applications for government grants. I appreciate it's not possible for every application to be successful. But I do feel for the unsuccessful applicants, who must now reconcile that their applications were unsuccessful despite being deemed suitable by the department and despite money actually being in the bank for it. I congratulate the Penneshaw Foreshore Upgrade Project as the only successful application in Mayo, and I do hope that round 2 efforts afford better outcomes for Mayo. I must say I'm pleased the minister has said that she will roll over those $93 million, but that's $93 million that could be now spent in regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Last month I had the absolute pleasure of attending the Australian Philippine Association of the Illawarra's 43rd annual June ball with the state member for Wollongong. We celebrated the 126th anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Philippines with the Filipino community in Cunningham. We also celebrated the 78th anniversary of Philippine-Australian bilateral relations. The Australian Philippine Association of the Illawarra would not be what it is today without the incredible dedication and hard work of one of their founding members and president, Lilia McKinnon, their secretary, Erna De Los Reyes, and their amazing management committee. Lilia and Erna have played a huge part in shaping and nurturing the organisation, with their efforts being instrumental in the growth and influence within the community. Their passion to preserve and celebrate the rich Filipino culture in the Illawarra can be seen through their warm and welcoming personalities, making all members feel like they are part of the family. Their tireless efforts in organising events celebrating cultural diversity and promoting Filipino heritage have improved the cultural landscape of the Illawarra region. The Illawarra is a vastly diverse area, and the Filipino Australian community has contributed to the multicultural community that I am so proud to represent. I would like to thank Lilia, Erna and the Australian Philippine Association of the Illawarra for the amazing work that they do.</span>

Alan's perseverance and joy throughout the project has been such a testament to the goodwill and talent of so many Australians that I have decided to name this great space after him. It's been a pleasure to host Alan as he restored this piano to its former glory. I look forward to welcoming more of the community into the Bonner office and seeing the potential of this space fully unlocked and appreciated, just like my piano. We've already had some booking requests come through, so I encourage interested groups to secure their spot. If you are interested in using the Alan Burge Community Room, please send me an email. I know it will be a versatile resource for many.</span>

I was so impressed by their good behaviour, intelligent questions and general interest in the role of politics and parliament in our society and, in particular, our electorate of Macarthur that I thought they deserved a speech about them. All their questions were terrific, and they offered an insight into what the leaders of tomorrow are thinking. Some stand-out questions were: Can you help ensure public schools get more funding? Can you help get more green spaces and play spaces for our community? Can you do better for our environment? A particular favourite of mine was: can you tell Woolworths to make their paper bags much stronger? All of these questions I strongly agree with, particularly the Woolies bag question, which received strong applause! These questions show that they understand the issues that are affecting their households and their wider communities, and I'll continue to raise the issues that they spoke about with me in parliament and with our leaders. I encourage my colleagues to make the time to meet with their schools, if they're visiting parliament, and to take the time to hear what their students and staff have to say.</span>

For voting to recognise the state of Palestine, which is technically meant to be Labor's platform. Since Israel's genocidal invasion of Gaza began, what has Labor done? It has signed weapons contracts with blacklisted Israeli weapons companies, paused aid funding to Palestine for 48 days, refused to take any actions against Israel as it carries out a genocide in Gaza.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about some of the facts. Thirty-seven thousand Palestinians have been murdered, 72 per cent of them women and children. Eighty-five thousand Palestinians have been wounded. One million Palestinians are at risk of death by starvation as a result of Israel's engineered famine. It's genuinely incredible that not a single Labor member in this place apart from Senator Payman was able to stand up, speak on behalf of Senator Payman and say, 'We defend her, and we defend the decision she took, because it was one of principle.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  As a former disability support worker, I remember the days when the NDIS didn't exist for people with disabilities. I can tell you that the NDIS has literally changed lives, giving choice, independence and control back to people with disabilities. When I was running for parliament, I heard time and time again from mothers, fathers and carers just how important the NDIS is to everyday survival. My husband works in the disability sector, and I have a stepdaughter with a disability. I talk about the value of the NDIS within our family and the importance of the reforms in place to ensure that those in need receive the funding they need to get the support they need. I know that, like Medicare, it is an essential safety net, and I will always fight for the NDIS.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People with disabilities can trust this Labor government to protect people with disability and reform the NDIS to be even better. The government is doing a lot of work to make the NDIS better and more sustainable after nine years of neglect by the former Liberal government. An extra $468 million in this year's budget will get the NDIS back on track. Importantly, $213 million will fight fraud and stop unscrupulous providers. This is on top of the $732 million provided in last year's budget. Thank you for getting NDIS back on track.</span>

Conway grew up in Wellington Point and joined the Army in 1947, just a month after his 18th birthday. Over the next decade and a half, he served with distinction in Korea, in the Malayan Emergency and in Vietnam as part of an Australian Army training team.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1964, Warrant Officer Class 2 Conway was attached to the US Special Forces at Camp McBride at Nam Dong. Just before 3 am on 6 July, a Viet Cong battalion launched a coordinated attack on the camp. As mortar rounds crashed down, Conway was among the first to act. He made a 30-metre dash to a forward mortar pit. As he entered the pit to make his defence, Conway was shot and mortally wounded. He was 35 years old.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following his passing, the South Vietnamese posthumously awarded him the National Order of Vietnam—their highest award. Conway was initially laid to rest in Saigon and then reinterred in Singapore. In 2016, his remains were repatriated to Australia, and he was laid to rest with full military honours in Cleveland Cemetery in my electorate. Conway now rests peacefully in the red soil of the Redlands, his Bayside home far away from the jungles of South-East Asia. As we mark six decades since his passing, we remember the sacrifice of the subsequent 522 Australians who died in the Vietnam War. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Today, I would like to rise to recognise a magnificent young girl and brave hero during an emergency in my electorate of Robertson: Ms Olivia Bird. Olivia came to the rescue of Ms Diana Johnston, who suffered a fall on 15 May. Early on that morning, Ms Johnston tripped on her driveway as she was leaving the house. Ms Johnston was badly injured, spraining, bruising and lacerating different parts of her body. She was unconscious, lying on her driveway in the cold while others passed her by. Luckily, though, young Olivia saw her from next door and quickly ran to her aid, calling out for her parents to help. While Olivia's parents attended to Ms Johnston, she reassured her that she would be okay, saying that she would look after her until the ambulance arrived. Olivia was by Ms Johnston's side the whole time, being a calm voice and a very, very brave person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to say that Ms Johnston was eventually discharged from hospital 15 days later. Ms Johnston believes that if it were not for Olivia's quick thinking and selflessness she would have been in more pain and suffered more serious injuries. Thank you to Olivia for being a true hero of the Central Coast and, indeed, Australia.</span>

While Labor eventually opted to retain and slightly amend the coalition's stage 3 tax relief, they've diluted the effect through their callous cuts and incompetence. Under Labor, food costs are 11.4 per cent higher. Rent costs are 14.2 per cent higher. Electricity costs are a whopping 21.5 per cent higher. The cost of schooling is up by 10.9 per cent. Health care is up by 11.1 per cent. The NBN is up, insurance is up and gas is up. Mortgages are up by as much as $24,000 a year more than what they were under the coalition, and that's $24,000 for the average mortgage holder after tax. That's $2,000 a month after tax. Who has that sort of money?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  When I was growing up, Fridays were a really important day. Not only was it the last day of the week for school before the weekend; it was the day that my dad would arrive home, usually at half past seven or a quarter to eight. He'd walk in after dogwatch—or nightshift, for those who aren't familiar with what that means—in an underground coalmine and he'd put a pay packet on the table. I can always remember that Mum would tear it open, and she'd count it. Then she'd look at the little computerised print on the pay packet. I can remember looking at it too as a young girl, thinking about gross, net, hours worked and overtime.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">People don't get paid that way anymore. They tend to get a direct deposit into an account. You might have it emailed to you or you might need to log on to look at your pay slip. While I know that people don't get paid in pay packets anymore, we're still talking people getting more money in their pay packet. In Paterson, people are getting more money in their pay packet thanks to the Albanese Labor government. Actually, they're getting, on average, $1,500 more per year in their pay packets. Indeed, 75,000 taxpayers in my seat of Paterson, in the Hunter, will receive a tax cut. There will be more in their pay packet thanks to this government. I am absolutely happy that we are giving Australians the opportunity to get better jobs. They're earning more and, importantly, they're getting to keep more of what they earn in their pay packet every week.</span>

We will rise together to condemn the graffiti on our war memorials that we've seen in the previous few days. Why do we do that? When you go to our war memorials, you will notice a simple thing: just their name. There's no rank. There are no honours. There's no party politics, race or religion. It is their name. We remember and honour their name because if we don't then what they did will be forgotten.</span>

He said, 'Wherever you can, say his name.' So, when people graffiti those war memorials and write things like 'complicit in genocide' or 'from the river to the sea', they dishonour not only their names but what they fought for and who we are as a nation. We are seeing far too much division. We're seeing a narrative that displays us as heroes or villains, when the true places for heroes are those war memorials. And they dishonoured them. We need to find ways to unite us as a nation, and the most important way to do that is to honour the people who fought and died for it. We utterly condemn the graffiti that was put on those war memorials.</span>

This tax relief will help working people, will help families and will help business owners just like Jen and Dan. These tax cuts are just one of the many ways the Albanese Labor government is helping Australians with the cost-of-living pressures.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise today to celebrate the incredibly talented young minds that I met in the 2024 Whitsunday STEM Challenge. Now in its seventh year, I was blown away by the hundreds of regional primary and high school students from the Mackay, Whitsunday and Isaac regions that come together to showcase their science, technology, engineering and maths skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whitsunday STEM Challenge builds students' critical thinking skills and encourages them to solve complex problems and collaborate in teams, all while participating in competitions, including F1 in Schools, Pedal Prix Super Series, RoboCup Junior and drone competitions. Students work in teams to design, build and code their robots to compete in various competitions, including soccer, drone-rescue operations, choreographed dance competitions and even darts. The F1 in Schools competition is the world's largest STEM competition, and is a test of speed and innovation for students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got the chance to chat with and compete against the national champions in the F1 in Schools competition, and I must say that I didn't stand a chance. I'm always blown away by the innovative young minds that I meet when I go to these competitions. I can tell you this: our future looks bright with these kids at the helm.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Some great news for coal workers—yesterday, hundreds of labour-hire workers at Batchfire's Callide mine, at Biloela, in Central Queensland, received some great news from the Fair Work Commission, with the first order under the new same-jobs same-pay laws being issued. This order covers over 350 labour-hire mineworkers employed by WorkPac at Callide. It means their pay must be lifted to match the rates under Batchfire's enterprise agreement covering permanent employees from 1 November this year. This is great news for employees, who will now receive between $10,000 and $20,000 extra a year in their pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 60 per cent of the operators at Callide were labour-hire employees. This pay rise will have a strong impact for so many in that local community. A huge congratulations to Grahame Kelly, Tony Maher and Mitch Hughes from the mighty Mining and Energy Union on getting the first order done and dusted. The labour-hire loophole is officially closed. This will be the first of many such decisions that will deliver extra pay to workers all over Australia. We've already had the Mount Pleasant site in the Hunter get rid of all labour-hire positions, making those positions permanent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour hire has a legitimate role, but it should never be used to undercut rates of pay. This is just another way the Albanese Labor government is delivering cost-of-living relief for workers right across Australia.</span>

And what does this government offer to fix it? A bowl of Labor spin and a dog's breakfast of half-baked policies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While mortgage holders, renters and pensioners wrestle with whether they eat or heat, the Prime Minister and Treasurer gaslight Australians with spin on how great they've actually got it under Labor. 'Inflation is coming down,' they say. 'Real wages are growing,' they say. 'Energy prices are coming down,' they say. 'Tax rebates will miraculously fix family budgets,' they say. The fact is the Albanese government has botched vaping laws, industrial relations, the energy rollout, water buybacks, the national vehicles emissions scheme, live exports, age verification, and let's not forget detainee releases under direction 99. The most disturbing aspect of this government apparently committed to transparency is the imposition of non-disclosure agreements on any stakeholder lucky enough to actually be consulted.</span>

They've been pounding the corridors of parliament trying to convince crossbench senators of the need for a more robust Senate inquiry process and calling for a more thorough examination of the volumes of evidence presented to the House Standing Committee on Agriculture during its hasty inquiry.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A total of 13,000 submissions were received by the committee, but only 668 were considered and published. Unpublished submissions included deeply personal stories on how this decision would affect families, businesses and the wider rural community. This is why we need a proper Senate inquiry, one that was promised by Minister Watt—yet another of Labor's broken promises.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night the Senate narrowly voted to end live sheep exports by sea. This government has prioritised animal activists who have blatantly misled the Australian public, some of whom have allegedly paid cash for cruelty on these vessels. This government has ignored the honest, hardworking rural voters whose livelihoods will be forever affected.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fight has only just begun. Prime Minister, you have been given notice that the people of the bush have been pushed too far. They are mustering their 'farmy army' to take the battle to the burbs and win back seats one Labor electorate at a time, beginning this weekend in the electorate of Hasluck and also the proposed electorate of Bulwinkle. All the best, and good luck.</span>

Many of those brave Australians sacrificed their lives for the hope of safeguarding the future we now occupy. It is the legacy that they have left for us, and it is right that we honour them—all 103,000 of them.</span>

To speak of how those monuments were defaced, rather than condemn the act itself, only provides more incentive for these cowardly acts to continue—acts that all sides of our parliament should always condemn and acts that should always be punished to the fullest extent of the law.</span>

Two years ago, the Prime Minister promised Australian families cheaper mortgages and that life would be easier, yet the Albanese government has increased spending by $315 billion, fuelling Labor's homegrown inflation crisis. The RBA governor has warned that if 'we are not getting inflation down then we won't hesitate to move and raise interest rates again'. What assurance can the Prime Minister give Australian families that there won't be a 13th rate rise on Labor's watch?</span>

It goes to the comments of the Reserve Bank governor and fiscal policy in the budget, a budget that has been handed down by the Treasurer not once but twice in the black—not mugs, just surpluses. Labor surpluses arose out of what we had, which were Liberal deficits. We turned a $78 billion deficit into a $22 billion surplus, following it up with another surplus, at the same time as inflation is almost half what it was when we inherited it. Those opposite always miss out the fact that interest rates started rising on their watch after they handed down the highest inflation quarter, which was March 2022 of 2.1 per cent. And how did they respond to that? In their March budget handed down by the former member for Kooyong was a cash splash, and that stands in stark contrast to what we have done. And that is why—</span>

He is such a strong advocate of better health care in Australia—for more bulk billing, for cheaper medicines and for better urgent care services—because he knows that Tasmania was hit so hard by that decade of cuts to and neglect of Medicare. It's especially hard to find a doctor in Tasmania, and bulk-billing rates there have been lower than in any other state for quite some time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to say that a few weeks ago the member for Lyons and I announced a fifth Medicare urgent care clinic for Tasmania, to be based around Bridgewater in his electorate. Like the other clinics, it's going to be open seven days a week, have extended hours and be available for walk-in patients, and, importantly, it will be fully bulk billed. I've said I want this clinic up and running by the end of the year because I know what a difference it will make to the people of Bridgewater but also to surrounding communities like Brighton and the northern suburbs of Hobart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lyons has also pushed us hard on better bulk billing. Before the last election, he was one of a number of Labor MPs who were reporting a growing sense of alarm in the community about falling rates of bulk billing for GP visits. The reason for that fall was crystal clear—a deliberate program by the Liberals to undermine bulk billing. We remember that the father of the modern Liberal Party, of course, called bulk billing 'an absolute rort'. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was health minister, tried to abolish bulk billing altogether. He said there were, in his words, too many free Medicare services. Well, that's not our approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, in November, we tripled the bulk-billing incentive after a call to do that by the College of General Practitioners. They called that a game changer. I'm pleased to report to the member for Lyons that, since doing that, the bulk-billing rate for GP visits in Tasmania has risen by more than eight per cent, and I've seen increases in every single state and territory since November. In the month of May alone, there were more than 900,000 additional free visits to the doctor—900,000 in just one month. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is doing everything it possibly can to help Australians with the cost of living: tax cuts for every taxpayer and energy bill relief for every household. And we know that more free visits to the doctor and cheaper medicines are not just good for the hip pocket, as good as that is; they're also good for your health. At the end of the day, that is how you deliver real cost-of-living relief, not by pushing up power prices through nuclear reactors.</span>

Last night Senator Fatima Payman released a statement claiming Labor members were 'attempting to intimidate me into resigning from the Senate'. On 7 November 2022 the Prime Minister said in this place, 'Everyone has the right to a safe and respectful workplace.' Prime Minister, what steps have been taken to investigate these claims of intimidation in Senator Payman's workplace?</span>

The member for Dunkley has only been here for a relatively short amount of time and already she's helped ensure that there will be a tax cut for every taxpayer from this week, helped ensure energy bill relief for every household in Australia, helped ensure that people on awards will get a pay rise from this week, and helped ensure that millions of Australians will get cheaper medicines and an extra couple of weeks of paid parental leave as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I well recall, in the member for Dunkley's campaign, going and speaking with the early childhood educators of her local community to tell them that every single one of them would be getting a tax cut because of this Prime Minister and this Labor government. It's not just the early educators but every single taxpayer in this country—$36 on average and $63 a week for the average household with kids. It's $26 a week for healthcare workers, $30 a week for teachers, $37 a week for truckies, $36 a week for builders, $51 a week for sparkies and $72 a week for miners. These are the tax cuts that come in this week because of this Prime Minister and this Labor government. Every single taxpayer in every single industry in this country gets a tax cut this week. In the shadow Treasurer's electorate 79,000 people will get a tax cut, averaging $30 a week, and in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate 79,000 people will get, on average, $31 a week.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax cuts are because of this government and despite that opposition. We know that, when they're asked about these tax cuts, they say of course they'll roll them back. The Leader of the Opposition wanted an election on these tax cuts when we made them fairer earlier in the year. But it doesn't end there. I think the House and the community should know that when the shadow Treasurer went on radio this morning—on 2CC, as I understand it—he was asked about the cost-of-living relief that rolls out this week and he dismissed it as handouts. He thinks that people working more, earning more and keeping more of what they earn is a handout. Doesn't that speak volumes about the shadow Treasurer and his colleagues! He said they were handouts and he said that they would ultimately make things worse. He should tell every Australian getting a tax cut this week, getting energy bill relief, getting cheaper medicines, getting a pay rise and getting an extra couple of weeks of paid parental leave that he thinks it's a handout which will make things worse. He has made it clear today that those opposite do not support cost-of-living relief for people doing it tough. We do, and we are delivering it.</span>

People within my electorate who have family in Gaza have been advised the quickest way to get them out is to apply for a visitor visa, yet, according to Senate estimates, 4,614 people applying for this visa from this area have been refused since 7 October, including my constituent's family members. Given our country's actions when it came to other recent conflicts, including the wars in Ukraine and Afghanistan, why hasn't our government established a clear pathway for people to bring their families from Gaza to safety here in Australia?</span>

The images every day out of Gaza affect all of us in this place and in the other place, and responding to that is a key focus of the Australian government. With that in mind I have been consistently engaging with representative bodies of the Palestinian community on this issue and on other related issues. I can advise the member and advise the House that I am continuing to do so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also say that all people who have arrived in Australia from the Occupied Palestinian Territories are presently able to access a bridging visa E, which will grant them work rights and access to Medicare. The same offer currently applies to arrivals from the Ukraine. This is an offer that has been directly communicated to those Palestinian bodies and to many Palestinians, as well as to those legal services that are engaged in supporting many in that community and in other refugee and like refugee communities. It is up to all individuals to determine a visa pathway that is appropriate for their circumstances, and I should say, of course, all people who apply for a visa of whatever type have to meet the requirements of the Migration Act. As all members would appreciate, everyone seeking to obtain a visa to come to Australia knows that that application needs to be considered on its individual merit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of visas is very important, and the supports that go with them, but so too is recognising the impact this conflict has more broadly on communities right across Australia. I'm very proud of the efforts across the government, led by the Prime Minister, to support affected communities, whether it's supports delivered by my friend the Minister for Education in school settings, recognising the particular impact of young people; the work done in the health and mental health space; the work across a whole range of initiatives—</span>

                  </a>  With respect, Mr Speaker—and to the minister—it's on relevance. The question was specifically related to, given the case of other wars, like war in Ukraine and war in Afghanistan, where there were specific pathways established for humanitarian visas, that's not been the case when it comes to Palestine. Why is the government not doing that?</span>

The member is raising a point of order, but the minister is being very directly relevant in talking about the subject topic. He's not deviating away from the subject matter but he has 48 seconds remaining to conclude his answer and make sure he is being directly relevant.</span>

                  </a>  For the benefit of the member for North Sydney and all members, at the start of my answer I said we are continuing to engage with community members on this issue. I was also going through the range of supports the government is putting in place and will continue to put in place to recognise the challenge to social cohesion that is presented by the impacts of this conflict on communities right across the Australian community. The visa issue is very important to the member and many other members. So too are the impacts, whether it is impacts on mental health or other impacts on individuals in the Australian community—citizens as well as people who arrive here on visas. All these things are important to me. All these things are a focus for the Albanese government.</span>

We were right there. It is about the same number of Australians who got tax cuts on Monday, just perchance! The workers who we met at that nursery are some of the 83,000 taxpayers who got a tax cut this week in Holt. That's 83,000 in just one electorate. In addition to that, of course, many of those workers that we discussed will get a pay rise in their next pay packet, because we want Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. In addition to that, every single household will receive $300 in power bill relief. The freezing of the cost of PBS medicines will make a difference as well. In addition, some—certainly not all of the constituents of Holt, but some—will benefit from the two weeks extra paid parental leave that will make a difference for families there. All of these measures are designed to help people under pressure and take pressure off inflation.</span>

                  </span>What we know is that real wages have actually grown more in the last year than grew under the entire length in which they were in office over there. That's more in one year under us than in 10 years under them. That is the common thread of what we've been doing—providing that assistance while taking pressure off inflation. Cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, fee-free TAFE—it's all of those measures. The other thing that all of these cost-of-living measures have in common is that they were opposed by those opposite. Not only do those opposite barrack for the worst outcomes for Australia; they vote for it. We want to see growth up, productivity up and wages up. They're only interested in cutting wages and talking the country down. We want to create jobs in manufacturing powered by cheaper, cleaner energy. They want to wreck investment and then charge taxpayers for the most expensive form of new energy that's available with their nuclear reactionary plan. We're building more homes and making super stronger; they want to wreck super by making people raid their super. We are getting bulk-billing back in business. The Leader of the Opposition wants a second crack at destroying Medicare after the attempts that were there in the 2014 budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In a new survey, Finder reports 13 per cent of mortgage holders have extended their home loan in the last year in order to lower their repayments. Finder home loans expert Richard Whitten says the average Australian household has much less disposable income compared to a few years ago. Prime Minister, after three failed budgets, why are Australian families paying the price for Labor's economic incompetence?</span>

The question is about mortgage stress. Obviously, we understand that, after rates began rising on their watch, that has put additional pressure on Australians with a mortgage. I think that's self-evident. Because of that, this is one of the reasons—the fact people are under pressure—that we are rolling out substantial, meaningful but responsible cost-of-living relief this week. If the shadow Treasurer really cared about the pressures that people are under in communities right around Australia, instead of opposing our cost-of-living relief, as he did on the radio this morning, he would support it, and he would support it enthusiastically. If the shadow Treasurer really understands the mortgage stress that people are under, he would enthusiastically welcome the fact that every single taxpayer is getting a tax cut this week. He would enthusiastically welcome the fact that every household is getting energy bill relief this week. He would enthusiastically welcome the fact that we're giving extra help to parents, that we're making medicines cheaper and that millions of Australians on award wages will be getting a pay rise this week with our full-throated support.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These questions from the shadow Treasurer would have much more credibility if he came out and said that he supported our cost-of-living relief. Instead, just this morning, when he was asked about this cost-of-living relief on radio, on 2CC, he dismissed it as a handout, and he said it would make it worse. That will be news to new parents who need extra help via the extension to paid parental leave. That will be news to people who pay a lot for medicines but, because of us, will be paying a little bit less. That will be news to people who need and deserve higher wages, particularly people on lower wages and people on award wages.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member asked about cost-of-living relief. I am pleased to tell him that, as of yesterday, with the delivery of the Albanese government's energy bill relief and the reductions in energy prices in the default market offer and the Victorian market offer, the average energy price for a household in Victoria is down 23 per cent. For small businesses, it is down 15.5 per cent. They don't like it; they don't like the news. It doesn't change the news when energy prices are coming down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in addition—for the member for Wills—to the 78,000 taxpayers in his electorate who are getting a tax cut on average of $31 a week. That is what real cost-of-living relief looks like. People who are doing it tough deserve a government with a detailed plan to deliver cost-of-living relief now, not some fantasy plan in decades' time which will backfire and put prices up, but real cost-of-living relief now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have medium-term plans. Our medium-term plan is the capacity investment scheme, which underpins new renewable energy in our country. Renewable energy is very different to nuclear energy—because I am asked about the differences. Renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy and nuclear is the most expensive form of energy and they don't go too well together. We saw that impact analysis from the independent office of impact assessments about our capacity investment scheme, which said, 'Consumers are expected to face lower retail electricity prices on average and a reduction in reliability risks.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen today the chair of the WA Economic Regulation Authority say, 'Carving out space in the power system for nuclear to operate around the clock would require putting on hold large-scale renewable generation'. That is the fact. Members opposite, when they are saying the quiet bit out loud, acknowledge it. The Leader of the National Party said he wants a cap on renewable energy in Australia. I give credit to the Leader of the National Party. He is calling the shots over there at the moment. He is writing their economic policy. I give credit where it is due. The Leader of the National Party is running the show. The problem is, when the Leader of the National Party is running the show, when it comes to economics or energy, that is bad news for the Australian people. But it is great news for the Leader of the National Party and he should get credit for it, because he is determining the policy which sees nuclear come in and renewables go out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the member for Hinkler say we should have less renewables and we should curtail renewables. The fact of the matter is the Leader of the Opposition wants a blank cheque for a bad deal, but it is the Australian people who would pay the price for that bad deal by it bringing in more expensive energy.</span>

In her electorate 88,000 taxpayers will get a tax cut—88,000! The member for Moncrieff dismisses that, saying it doesn't matter, saying it won't make a difference. I hope the member for Moncrieff writes to her constituents—all 88,000 of them—and says, 'The tax cut that you just got will make no difference whatsoever to you.' I hope that the member for Moncrieff also says to those in her electorate who, as part of the 2.6 million Australians on minimum or award wages, got a wage increase as well as a tax cut: 'That's irrelevant. That doesn't matter. You don't deserve it.' We know that they voted against it and said that they'd roll it back, and before last Thursday they said they would reimpose the tax cuts that were going to benefit the member for Moncrieff, me and everyone else in this chamber, at the expense of hard-working people—cleaners, aged-care workers and people working in supermarkets—who were going to simply miss out, get nothing whatsoever.</span>

There are 78,000 taxpayers in her electorate that, as of 1 July, have benefited from Labor's tax cuts, including a substantial number of women. We have deliberately placed women and gender equality at the centre of our economic plan. This hasn't happened by accident. We know that women work incredibly hard across our economy, and we do understand that people are under pressure and that some are doing it tough. That's why we are working to ensure that women earn more and get to keep more of what they earn, and that has happened because of the policies of this government.</span>

On average, women taxpayers will receive a tax cut of around $1,650, which is $707 more than they would have received under those opposite's stage 3 tax plans. When we were looking at the stage 3 tax plans, we wanted to make sure that the people who earned under $45,000—some of the lowest-income earners in the country—who were getting a big fat zero in tax cuts under those opposite's plans—</span>

We have changed that to ensure that they do now get a tax cut. They are predominantly women who work in child care, disability and aged care. They are nurses and teachers in highly feminised professions, and we are making sure that they actually earn more and then get to keep more of what they own.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, of course, we delivered our commitment to increase the paid parental leave scheme to 22 weeks, a really important reform to paid parental leave. But we're also making sure that we're paying superannuation on paid parental leave, and that will have a huge impact on women's retirement incomes in the years ahead, something I'm very proud of, on this side of the House. We've also ensured that we have the award wages increase, with 2.6 million Australians benefiting from wages increases. Again, these are some of the lowest paid workers in this country, predominantly women. And, of course, we are increasing superannuation overall, which will also assist women to make sure that they've got retirement incomes. We are delivering energy bill relief, freezing the cost of PBS medicines, making sure bulk-billing is going up so people can afford to see a doctor and getting a fairer deal for consumers at the supermarket checkout. Women's equality is a central driver of everything that we do on this side of the House, something of which I'm very proud.</span>

Prime Minister, in the gallery are representatives of the farmers, shearers, truckies and local communities whose livelihoods rely on the live sheep export industry that the Labor government is shutting down. Given Labor claims its phase-out of live sheep exports is due to animal welfare, can the Prime Minister name one country that has higher animal welfare standards for live exports than Australia?</span>

I met with farmers yesterday afternoon in my office. I listened to what they had to say and I respectfully, of course, indicated a preparedness to continue to work with them. They have an industry that's worth $80 million. The package that we have on the table is currently worth $107 million, greater than the annual industry. The truth is that the live sheep industry has been in decline compared with the sheepmeat industry, which is valued at around $4 billion and which has expanded substantially in places like the United Kingdom.</span>

And, yes, I know you'd like a one-word answer, but, as we have done many times, the standing orders don't provide for that. There are options to provide that. No-one's taken me up on the offer to ensure that could happen. So, whilst the standing orders exist as they are and the Prime Minister is being directly relevant to the topic—and I think he's quoting another member of parliament regarding the issue—I'm left with no other choice than to make sure that he remains on topic.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:42</span>):  Congratulations to the 90,000 Parramatta taxpayers getting a tax cut. But there's also good news for the over 400,000 people, the therapists and the disability support workers, who look after participants, who will all be getting tax cuts and have just got them. A disability support worker on $75,000 is going to get about $1,500 in tax cuts this year. An occupational therapist on $120,000 will get about a $2,700 tax cut. So that's good news. Plus, award wages have moved for disability carers, about 15 per cent, since Labor got elected. There's the $300 energy supplement and there are cheaper medicines, and super's going up to 11½ per cent. So, literally, the NDIS workforce is getting to earn more and keep more of what they earn. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are some threats to the relief of cost-of-living pressures for people on the scheme and for the people working in it. There are vital NDIS reforms to get a better deal for participants that are stuck in the Senate until mid-August. This is bad news, because the actuary of the scheme has said that an eight-week delay on this bill is going to add a billion dollars in inflated costs to the NDIS. The Senate has had 12 weeks to look at this matter, but, puzzlingly, the coalition members of the Senate have got some more questions they need answered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I explained last week that personal budgets are getting overspent before the expiry of people's plans, and that's a loophole we need to stop—the automatic top-ups. But there's another change I'd like to let the House reflect upon. Currently the act only excludes supports that are supposed to be funded by other service systems, but it doesn't rule out specific services in the primary legislation. The courts have taken a very broad interpretation about what NDIS money is allowed to be spent on. They've been rolling successive governments on NDIA decisions. There's a new section 10 which will exclude some of the specific decisions which shouldn't be being funded because they're not true to the purpose of the scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But remember I said that the Liberals haven't made up their mind? I want to put this to the House: what is so difficult that it will require eight weeks and a billion dollars? At the moment we want to rule out the payment of strata fees; fines; steam rooms; gambling; legal cannabis; cruises; trips to Japan; non-assistance animals; taxidermy; weddings; gift cards; the Liberal favourite, sex toys; crystal therapy; cuddle therapy; clairvoyance and tarot—</span>

Liberals chanted, 'Red Ted better dead.' With the advent of industrial-scale mining, Chillagoe, without port access, was choked into oblivion. West of Cairns are six of Australia's eight biggest rivers. Doesn't this necessitate building the $1,000 million bridle track tunnel, thereby accessing the port and exploding North Queensland's current mineral, food, timber and industrial production to over $21,000 million a year?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:47</span>):  I thank the member for Kennedy for his fine question. He's a tireless advocate for his community. I do acknowledge that north-west Queensland, Chillagoe and other places right across western Queensland have been very important and have had a very important role in the labour movement. I want to acknowledge the member for Kennedy and his compelling stand against the coalition's unfair tax plans. As he has referenced the labour movement, I will mention how important Labor's tax cuts are to his constituents in Kennedy. Over 71,000 taxpayers in your electorate, Member for Kennedy, will receive a tax cut of over $1,400 each.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member very importantly raised the matter of Cairns, the Cairns port and port access and the need for infrastructure in North and north-west Queensland. They are vital for the economy and for the development of the resources sector there. Indeed, I hosted the Northern Australia Ministerial Forum at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Cairns</span>, in Cairns, last October with the ministers from Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. In relation to the port itself, the Australian government will contribute $150 million toward the $300 million expansion of the Cairns Marine Precinct, which is really important for the export industry that will come through the North West Minerals Province in his electorate. The member for Kennedy mentioned the proposed idea of the bridle track tunnel to the Cairns port. That is a very large undertaking, and there has been much discussion about it.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will point out to the member for Kennedy that, as you know, the Labor government is delivering on our $120 million commitment to the shared commitment with the Queensland government of a $260 million upgrade to the Kuranda Range road. I know the Kuranda Range road, Member for Kennedy, is not the ideal solution for what you want to achieve in the north-west province; it is a difficult road and it does have its problems. As the member for Kennedy knows and as I know, there are a lot of geographical challenges in getting items from his electorate to the Cairns port. What is really important is that we do support the workers of north-west Queensland and that we do support those other incentives to increase mining activity in his electorate. I look forward to discussing with the member for Kennedy his support for the production tax credits, worth $17 billion, for critical minerals in his electorate, as well as many others. QEM's Vanadium mine in Julia Creek, in the member for Kennedy's electorate, is one of the world's largest deposits of this critical mineral, and I'll be more than happy to brief him and the very good, hardworking people in his office in relation to how we can incentivise the resources sector in his electorate of Kennedy.</span>

As a result of the Albanese Labor government's tax plans, every member of the Australian Defence Force and every public servant in the Department of Defence received a tax cut yesterday. That's right across the board, from a civilian dog-handler at RAAF Base Amberley, who, this financial year, will receive a tax cut of $2,197, through to a Navy Leading Seaman medical assistant at Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin, who will receive a tax cut of $2,047, or to an Air Force vehicle mechanic at RAAF Base Richmond, who will receive a tax cut of $1,463. And that tax cut is twice what those people would have received under the stage 3 tax cuts of those opposite.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in addition to wage increases for the Defence Force of eight to nine per cent since the Albanese government came to office, and they are the biggest wage increases that we've seen in the Defence Force in more than a decade. When you combine that with what we've done to improve Defence Force housing, what we've done for Defence families to improve the family health benefit and what we've done to increase retention bonuses, all of this has meant that, for those men and women who choose to wear our nation's uniform, more is being offered and more is being done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is actually making a real difference to the challenge of recruitment and retention. Separation rates are now falling and recruitment rates are starting to turn around. By literally valuing our Defence Force personnel more, we are making a thoughtful contribution to workforce planning. Seven weeks ago, the shadow minister said that in eight weeks time, which is now next week, he will be releasing his own detailed workforce plan. Certainly, we are all very much looking forward to that. But so far, his only idea has been to suggest that we take tens of thousands of public servants, from who knows where, cut them and put them into uniform. That idea, he explicitly said, was on the table. I wonder, has that idea worked anywhere in the world ever?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While those opposite are busily barking at the moon, the Albanese Labor government is improving the lives of the men and women who wear our nation's uniform, because we know that it is their service which keeps Australians safe.</span>

I look forward to returning and knocking on the doors of homes in Deakin—homes that we want more of. That's why we have a plan to build 1.2 million homes.

I'm not surprised by the Liberal Party acting in that way, but they did consistently, and eventually we were able to get that legislation through the Senate.

When you put a question before the House like, 'Why is homeownership out of the reach of Australians?' which was the question at the end—yes, there were other factors in there—that's a fairly broad statement. Obviously, the Prime Minister doesn't agree with that statement, so he's going to outline—the remainder of his answer won't be about the opposition, because, if it is, he won't complete his answer. But, when there is a broad statement, really, at the end, he's going to have a broad answer.</span>

                  </a>  I'm speaking about what our plans have been to build more homes. The build-to-rent tax incentives that were passed in the House of Representatives and blocked in the Senate last week—so you're against more social homes. You're against more private rentals, and the argument for voting against build to rent was that developers would build the homes. That was the argument that the Greens political party put out. Surprise, surprise, developers build homes! That's the way that it works, and that's what the build-to-rent scheme was about.</span>

It's shared equity scheme that has been implemented in the past—previous coalition governments introduced them in various places and supported them, particularly in Western Australia—but they're opposed to that as well. They support homes, except for public housing, except for private housing and homeownership, and except for private rentals. Apart from that, they're all for it!</span>

Lingiari is most of the Northern Territory, covering many remote communities, and I can tell you the poverty there is grinding. The first stage of our Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program will create 3,000 new jobs, real wages, proper conditions and the sorts of things that we all expect to come with the job in sectors like community services or health care, hospitality, tourism and horticulture, which will help with the cost of living in remote communities where people are doing it so, so tough.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago I was in Kununurra and I met Connie and her mother, who are both part of the New Jobs Program Trial. They are working at the Lily Lagoon Resort. They told me what having a job means to their lives, what it means for their families and what it means for their communities. It is making a difference to their skills. It is making a difference to the way in which they can look to the future. Jobs in remote communities are about so much more than a pay slip. They help to break the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage, build stronger communities and create opportunities for the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decent housing and employment are fundamental to closing the gap. Many Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory live in overcrowded conditions. I think most people are aware of that. This drives poor health, educational outcomes and economic and social outcomes. In March, the Prime Minister and I visited Binjari in the Northern Territory and announced a $4 billion agreement with the Northern Territory government to build 2,700 homes over the next 10 years. It will halve overcrowding.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago, on the Tiwi Islands, I signed a partnership agreement to deliver these houses with the Northern Territory government, Aboriginal Housing Northern Territory and the land councils of the Territory. It demonstrates a new way of doing business with Aboriginal communities. Houses will be built that are culturally appropriate and meet the climatic needs of those parts of the world. This has meant a 200 per cent increase in the Albanese government's investment in Aboriginal housing. Last financial year alone, we delivered 250 houses. These measures are changing lives.</span>

It was recently announced that emergency responders, volunteers and community workers involved in the February-March 2022 floods in northern New South Wales and Queensland may now rightly be eligible for the National Emergency Medal. The Central West New South Wales floods of November 2022 saw extraordinary acts of courage and service across our communities, including the biggest helicopter rescue in Australia's history, at Eugowra. Will you support the National Emergency Medal being extended to those who served with such distinction in that emergency?</span>

One thing we see right across this chamber is that it's sometimes at those worst moments for our country where we see the very best of the Australian spirit, and I know across your community, Member for Calare, you saw acts of bravery and heroism that you think are appropriate to be acknowledged.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say a few quick words about the government's overall response to this, and then I will get to the direct question, about the medal, that the member has raised. As the Prime Minister has noted, he was there in the community in March talking to your constituents about how this has affected your local area. The Albanese government has delivered a range of different funding supports to support the Central West in the recovery from this very significant event. Late last year the government announced a cost-sharing agreement for $100 million—a package which included $60 million to assist in mitigation measures and up to $40 million in cost sharing for a housing program to support people who were displaced by this event.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the National Emergency Medal, there is a National Emergency Medal committee which manages this process on behalf of the Commonwealth government. It's not a decision for ministers about who is able to access this. There's quite a lengthy criteria that the National Emergency Medal committee looks at, which includes the scale and community impact of the disaster, how many casualties resulted and how much critical infrastructure was destroyed in the disaster. I believe they've made an initial decision which does not account for people in the member's electorate. I say that, from their perspective, this doesn't diminish any of those efforts that were gone to.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the request of the member, the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister has taken the very unusual step of writing to the committee and asking them to give reconsideration to the matters the member has raised here. I can see why he has raised this matter, and I can understand him representing his constituents in that way. We will be very pleased to liaise with the committee and come back to the local member when we have a response. To the member, I'm sure that if at any time anyone in this House is experiencing natural disaster, the Minister for Emergency Management or myself are always available to meet and talk further about these matters.</span>

We promised we'd deliver a national anticorruption commission without delay, and we did.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one year since the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission is tasked with detecting, investigating and preventing corruption across the Commonwealth public sector. We said it would have a broad jurisdiction, and it does. We said it would be able to receive referrals from anyone, and it can. We said it would have strong statutory oversight, and it does. We said it would have retrospective powers, and it does. We said it would have the power to hold public hearings to make findings of fact and operate with robust procedural fairness, and it does. And, most importantly, we said it would be independent of government, and it is. Only the commission can decide what it investigates. Designing the commission this way was a deliberate choice. It is the best way of ensuring the commission maintains its independence, and, of course, the independence of this commission is critical to its success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its first 12 months the commission has received 3,154 referrals. It's conducting 26 corruption investigations and overseeing or monitoring a further 21 investigations by other agencies. Those opposite, of course, also committed to establishing an integrity commission. The former Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, stood up with the former Attorney-General, Christian Porter, at the end of 2018, and promised a national anticorruption commission, and they broke their promise. You can't trust those on the other side to mean what they say, you can't trust those on the other side to deliver on what matters to Australians and you can't trust their priorities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This side of the House is focused on what matters. Yesterday tax cuts were delivered for every Australian taxpayer. A $300 discount on energy bills was delivered for every Australian household. That's how you deliver cost-of-living relief, not by pushing up power prices with nuclear reactors. We have our priorities right, we listen to Australians and we deliver on our commitments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is taking action on a number of fronts to make our economy more competitive. Here I shout-out the assistant minister for competition for the work that we do to that end. We're strengthening the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct to make it mandatory to get a fair go for farmers and families. We commissioned the consumer group CHOICE and funded them so that people can find and follow cheaper prices at the checkout. We're strengthening our merger approval system. We've increased the penalties for anticompetitive conduct, and we've banned unfair contract terms as well. We've empowered the ACCC when it comes to supermarket prices because we want to make our supermarkets as competitive as they can be so that people can get the best prices possible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition today made another chaotic announcement. There are always two common features when those opposite make an announcement: step 1, roll the shadow Treasurer—tick!—and step 2, not be able to answer the most basic question about the most basic details of the policy. We saw the shadow Treasurer rolled on nuclear and public subsidies. We saw him rolled on tax cuts just last week. And we saw him rolled again today when it comes to divestiture powers in the supermarket sector. But, in fairness to the shadow Treasurer, he's not the only one rolled today. On Peter Stefanovic's show, not that long ago, Senator Hume said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, there's always concern with divestiture powers whether they will actually decrease prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's from the shadow minister for finance. This is the usual half-baked announcement that's been rushed out to try and cover up the last half-baked announcement, which was the nuclear reactors that they don't have a cost for. Once again, we're seeing that here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite really cared about supermarkets or competition or inflation, they would have asked us about it today. The announcement was only made just before question time, and they couldn't even get around to asking about it. That's because they are hopelessly divided on this question. The shadow Treasurer has been rolled. The shadow finance minister has been rolled. The Leader of the National Party has got his way over the wishes of so many others on that front bench.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the food and grocery code, when it looked at this matter, said that the risk was that it could actually make things worse, not better. It found that forced divestiture resulted in a supermarket selling some of its stores to another large incumbent or in the enforced closure of stores, and we might see less competition, not more competition. Because of that, the food and grocery code review didn't see it as a credible threat. Previous competition reviews all the way back to 1993 and 2015 didn't recommended it. This is the usual half-baked idea to cover up the last half-baked idea.</span>

A new UBS report has forecast power prices to soar by up to 50 per cent by 2029 as Labor's renewables rollout stalls, forcing state Labor governments to extend the life of coal-fired power stations to keep the lights on. Prime Minister, why are Australian families paying the price for Labor's economic incompetence?</span>

                  </a>  On their watch, 24 of the nation's ageing coal-fired power stations announced they were closing—24 out of 28! Eight had shut by the time we came to office. Of course, those closures included Liddell, Redbank in Queensland, Wallerawang in Queensland, Anglesea, Northern Power, Playford, Morwell and Hazelwood. All of this happened, and those opposite just had their little internal debates. We had the NEG, we had various schemes—22 different schemes announced—and nothing happened. Nothing was actually adopted, which is why Andrew McKellar from ACCI has said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now what they say is that they will wind back and oppose our Rewiring the Nation plan, our Capacity Investment Scheme, our safeguard mechanism—even though they're the ones who came up with it—the deployment of community batteries, the energy efficiency upgrades, the small business energy incentive and all the work that we're doing to provide business with certainty. That's why the Business Council of Australia, Australian Industry Group and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry stood with the Australian Conservation Foundation as well as workers' representatives from the ACTU and supported this plan going forward.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now what they say is: 'Stop all that and do nothing until the 2040s. We've got a plan, but we won't tell you how much it will cost. We will tell you that taxpayers will pay for it, but we won't tell you how many reactors there will be. We won't tell you how many gigs will be generated as a result. We won't tell you any of the detail of how we get around planning. On the one hand, we will impose this on communities, but, on the other hand, we will listen to them. We won't tell you what will happen when those sites are rejected.' It's not a plan; it's just a thought bubble to once again delay investment and to make it more difficult. The only thing that can happen under their plan is an escalation of power prices, which is what every expert in the energy sector knows will happen. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining union has been making a number of applications of the Fair Work Commission, and yesterday we got the first decision from the Fair Work Commission. It goes to mine workers at the Callide coalmine, in Queensland. Reportedly, for those workers at Callide, the difference in pay between labour hire and directly employed workers was $10,000 to $20,000 a year. Only 40 per cent were employed directly; the rest were employed by WorkPac. These were workers who attended the same meetings but were paid less, who operated the same machines but were paid less, who wore the same uniform to work but were paid less, who followed instructions from the same managers but were paid less, who used the exact same roster but were paid less, who were in the same production crews but were paid less, who shared the same crib facilities but were paid less, who undertook the same training but were paid less and who did the same job but were not given the same pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can announce to the House what was decided by the Fair Work Commission yesterday: from 1 November these workers who are doing the same job will get the same pay. This is something that was fought for by members on this side and opposed by every single member opposite, and the summary of what that means in terms of cost of living—because when you talk about cost of living, one of the critical things is: 'What's the money that's going into your bank account to start with?'—is that, for these workers, more money is going into their bank account because of the pay rises. More money is going into their bank accounts because of the tax cuts. One of those workers, Josh, said this: 'The pay rise will have a very strong impact, particularly since I've just started a family. I now have a daughter who's just two months old, and this pay rise will help go towards the essential things like housing, grocery, bills, nappies and baby clothes.' Every one of those workers, as the extra money goes into their bank accounts, knows that those opposite want people to work longer for less, and those on this side want to make sure that they earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  There's a term that has gone down in Australian political journalism history with some infamy called 'ideological bastardry'. It was mentioned by a left-wing journo from the ABC about a Liberal prime minister, but I can tell you right now that the legislation that I think shows one of the biggest acts of political bastardry since I've been in here has been the banning of live sheep exports by this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This hasn't been done simply on ideology; it hasn't been done for animal welfare reasons—we are the best animal welfare advocates in the world in this industry—and it certainly hasn't been done for economics. It's being done simply because of animal activists and this government kowtowing to animal activism. And they have history on this too. Let's not forget that, back in 2011, the leftie <span style="font-style:italic;">Four </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Corners</span> program did a hatchet job on live exports and the then Labor agriculture minister shut down live exports overnight. What that did, and what the live sheep export ban does, was more than harm the live export industries that they affect. That affected cattle prices across the country. This live export ban on sheep has already affected sheep prices across the country. It affects every sheep farmer, whether they be on the east coast or the west coast. It affects international relationships. That live export ban back in 2011 did a lot of harm to the relationship between Indonesia and Australia, as this live export ban is doing to many other countries that we export to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were people in the gallery earlier and there are people in this building today who are good people. They're people who directly work in the live export industry, or they're suppliers; they might be truck drivers or veterinarians. But all their jobs revolve around the live export industry. I had the pleasure of speaking to many of them when I was in Western Australia a month or so ago, and they're good people. What they do is generate wealth and jobs for our country. I think we should—and we do on this side of politics—thank them for what they do. I think the Labor government should be apologising for the mental health anguish that they're giving to the people who work in this industry, as well as the financial and emotional trauma they're causing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can say with great pleasure that, if we as a coalition of the Liberal and National Parties on this side of politics are elected at the next election under the leadership of Peter Dutton and David Littleproud, we will reinstate the live sheep export industry. We will not shut you down. But let's be very clear to them and for them who is shutting them down. Again, so often in the legislation we talk about in this chamber, it is this city-versus-country divide. Who has decided that what our farmers do or how they do it isn't okay? Again, it is these inner-city, elite MPs. They start over there. They're the teal inner-city elites. They're the Greens, who are all inner-city elites. And then we go around to the Labor Party, and the majority of them again are inner-city, elite MPs. Let's be really clear that it is these inner-city, elite MPs who have voted this industry out of existence because they, living in their concrete jungles more often than not, think they know best what farmers can or should do in regional areas. Again, this is just another example of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll have five people get up opposite and talk about why they're doing this. They will say things like: 'We should process it here. We should do all the processing. We should value-add, and we should process here.' That again just highlights their absolute ignorance, because even the sheepmeat processors in Western Australia support the live export industry. They know that, for the sheep industry in Western Australia to have a future, they need processing, live export and wool. Even the sheepmeat processors know that they need this industry. They'll get up and go, 'No; we can process it all here in Australia.' None of them have probably been to a processor. I have had the pleasure of having a beef processor in my electorate, and right now no processor in the country can get enough staff. We are battling to process the demand for processing in this country right now.</span>

                  </a>  Member for Hasluck, you keep interjecting. We're coming for you on this one! We had a whole lot of people in this building, and they can't wait to doorknock your electorate—through you, chair. I just highlight that to the member. Again, they'll get up and say, 'We should process it all ourselves.' They probably won't get up, or, if they do get up and talk about animal welfare, that will be interesting, because we have the best animal welfare processes in the country and indeed the world. No industry is perfect. We have all seen images from the live export industry and other industries where they needed to improve. They have continually improved processes and standards, which is why they are the best in the world. Australia, as I say, has the best welfare standards in the world. This again shows the ignorance: the Prime Minister got up today and said that this is a dying industry anyway. But the numbers don't support this. Live sheep exports in 2022 were 380,000 tonnes. In 2023, they went to 640,000 tonnes. This is a lucrative industry. This is an industry that there is more demand in, and it's a growing industry economically. Again, this was inner-city, elite MPs, listening to the leftie press that they follow and saying they know best. They weren't talking to farmers, or talking to them about how they improved industry or why it's important to them.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through just some of the ways that this industry has improved its standards over the last few years. We've had: a moratorium on exports in the Northern Hemisphere summer; increased space for each animal; improved ventilation; automated monitoring; independent observers; and inspections of animals before they get on the boat to make sure they're fit enough to undergo the journey. Now, we even have examples of livestock putting weight on during these journeys. I'm a modest cattle farmer, Deputy Speaker, and I can tell you that if an animal is putting on weight, they're doing very well. Mortality rates are lower than the national mortality rates we have in paddocks. We even monitor—we have a look at—the feedlots and the abattoirs that these live exports go to, to make sure they're at standards that are up to our standards. Again, we have been a world leader in improving the standards of this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, since we came to government, we've taken seriously our relationships with other countries. We've made sure that we've worked with China so that our wine exporters, in the last year, have exported more wine to China than in the previous two years because those opposite decided loudspeaker diplomacy was better than actually working with the country. We've seen a number of tariffs come off our agricultural products because we take seriously that farmers need to export their produce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last two elections we have committed to phasing out live sheep exports by sea. This move hasn't come as a surprise to anyone. In fact, what we've done is put in place a long timeframe so that we can help the industry to transition. It wasn't done lightly and it wasn't done without consultation. Yes, we know there is going to be an impact in WA. But we also know we can do more if we actually process more here. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union said the government's policy would create between 500 and 800 extra direct jobs in meat processing, with more indirect jobs that will flow from that. It means more jobs for WA and paves the way for WA farmers to supply Australia's nearly $8 billion sheepmeat industry with more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation provides some certainty for farmers. It provides a timeline of transition. Let's be clear: there is going to be a transition. There is a total of $107 million to be provided over five years to help the industry transition. That is $64.6 million to assist those sheep producers in the supply chain to transition, allowing farmers to capitalise on existing and emerging opportunities so they are well positioned when the trade ends; $27 million to enhance demand within Australia and internationally for sheepmeat products, to maintain and develop market opportunities; $2.6 million to continue to improve sheep welfare standards so that they are practical and meet community expectations, including in engagement with the World Organisation for Animal Health; and a $1.7 million package to appoint a transition advocate to facilitate two-way communication between the industry and government, to pave the way for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we have seen live sheep exports decline over time; that is just a fact. Over the last 20 years we've seen live sheep exports decline from 6.5 million head to 652,000 head right now. In a decade of decline, what did those opposite do? Nothing. Crickets. They did nothing to improve regulation, nothing to help support the industry and nothing to grow the industry anywhere else. In 2023 Australia exported $4.4 billion in chilled and frozen sheepmeat—almost 60 times the value of live sheep exports by sea. And we want to increase that. There were approximately 70,000 tonnes of chilled meat airfreighted from Australia to international trading partners between 1 September 2022 and 31 August 2023.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a Labor government to act and do more in this space. It is incredibly frustrating to stand here and listen to the member for Page talk about how there is a bunch of inner-city Labor MPs driving this. I can tell you, I am not from the inner city, and I represent a lot of agricultural industry in my electorate—an electorate that has seen an increase because of what this government has done in its work with China, making sure that our wine producers can export more in the end and making sure we're taking tariffs off wheat and barley. There is still more work to do with our lobsters as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a government that takes thing seriously. It was all crickets when those opposite were in government. I didn't hear a single word, not a single word, when there were transmission lines going on agricultural properties in my electorate. When you were in government, there wasn't anything that you said, and not a single thing that you did, to make it easier for farmers in that consultation process. Yet in opposition it's all: 'Hold on! You're doing something that's making a difference.' No, these things didn't start when we came to government two years ago; they started years before. Those opposite could have done something about it when they were in government, but they did nothing to help communities dealing with renewable energy projects that came into their electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took a Labor government to say consultation by renewable energy companies has not been good when it comes to regional communities. It took a Labor government to put in dollars—$20 million in the last budget—to say: 'You need to do better, and you should do better, by consulting properly with communities. It's not a tick-a-box exercise.' Over and over again it was crickets when those opposite were in government, and yet when they're on the opposition benches it's loud, it's ferocious, it's: 'Oh, we've got to stand up for the regions.' When those opposite are in government, they're here for each other, here to stab each other in the back and take each other's positions, here for power's sake; they're not here to make a difference for the community. What we see, time and time again, is that all of these issues are left until a Labor government comes in. There is a very, very big chasm between what you say you're going to do in government and what you actually do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually support the National Farmers Federation in their bold ambition for a $100 billion industry by 2030. I absolutely support that. I think that's a great aim and, as a large country with a big agriculture industry, we should absolutely be aiming for $100 billion by 2030, and more, in a whole range of sectors across agriculture, on land or in the water. We have all of the expertise, all of the knowledge right here in this country. But time and time again our farmers have been let down when you have been in government. Time and time again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not good enough now to sit on the opposition benches and say, 'Look, there is a declining industry, but we were going to do nothing about it.' What we want to do is increase local sheepmeat producing, we want to open new markets, we want to make sure farmers are taken care of, which is why there is a long transition period, out to 2028. We need to provide certainty to people, and that's exactly what we're doing with this bill, with this government, because we on this side of the House believe in providing certainty for people. People knew what they were voting for in the last two elections. That's exactly what we've legislated, and we've made sure that there is a long transition period to help sheep farmers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I want to speak directly to my farmers today. I want to say, despite what happened in the other place last night, be proud of what you do. Be proud of what you do because the country rides on your back. The farmers of this country feed us and they provide the prosperity. The inner city has now turned on you, that is true, but you should be very, very proud of what you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to address the fact that this industry, which is so important to the farmers of Western Australia, is not finished. The phase-out date, 1 May 2028, has been voted on by the government in this place. That allows two elections between now and that phase-out date, so I say to my farmers: believe in your industry, believe that this government will change and the trade will continue after 1 May 2028. I say that with some confidence when I look at the New Zealand situation. When Jacinda Ardern was at her peak and much loved by everybody, mainly the media around the world, she banned the live export trade out of New Zealand—those were dairy heifers—because a vessel sank in tornado conditions off Japan. Interestingly enough, the effect of that ban meant poddy calves, those dairy heifers, were knocked on the head at three days of age because there was no market for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conservative government in New Zealand, which was elected on the same day as the referendum was held here in Australia, committed to reintroducing the trade. This week, their parliament is debating and passing that legislation to reintroduce the trade. So I say to my farmers: this trade will continue. This government will be gone at either the next election or the following one, and our leader, Peter Dutton, and the Leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, have committed to reintroduce the trade. That's to my farmers. I understand your confidence has been knocked around. The price has collapsed since the phase-out panel started to do its rounds last March and April in Western Australia. But I say to you: we will turn that around, and this trade will continue and thrive. It will thrive because our international customers value and demand our product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of visiting the Middle East in May, just a couple of weeks ago. While I was there, by the way, I hand-delivered a letter to the Kuwaiti government from the President of the WA Farmers Federation, John Hassell, and the Chairman of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, Tony Seabrook, saying directly to the Kuwait government: 'We reject the Australian government's policy and we want to continue to provide you with the best quality sheep in the world.' The Kuwaitis accepted that letter very gratefully because they have an enormous investment in this country. It's not just in the live sheep trade, although they do own feedlots and facilities here and they do own the boats. They also have up to $50 billion of investment across a whole range of industries in this country. Let me tell you, they're not that happy that the Australian government is effectively kicking sand in their face. The Australian government is saying to our Kuwaiti partners, who we've been dealing with for 50 years now: 'We don't want your trade. We don't want your investment, and we don't want to sell you our product.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kuwaitis love Australian sheep. I went to a butcher shop in Kuwait and bumped into a random man who was there doing the family shopping. I explained that we were from Australia, and he said: 'I love Australian sheep. I can't get any today.' The only sheep he could get was South African sheep. Guess what—South Africa have just had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. So, unfortunately, they won't be able to get sheep from South Africa either. But they are going to get sheep because that's what they want. That's what they demand. They want fresh sheepmeat, and they will get them from North Africa or the Black Sea, where there is no regulation, no ESCAS—there is nothing to protect those animals. When Australia steps out of that market, those standards that have been set in those countries, our destination countries, will disappear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, on a trade perspective, we have an opportunity. We have Saudi Arabia, who are taking our sheep for the first time in 13 years. For the first time in 13 years, we're getting sheep back into Saudi Arabia. They import eight million sheep a year—far more than we can ever provide. But I tell you what—they've accepted ESCAS. They've accepted our system of animal welfare, so because of the 150,000 sheep that we might send them next year—we haven't got enough to send them any more—the other 7.85 million sheep are going to get treated a lot better. Member for Fremantle, you should remember that when you make your remarks.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  What we're doing is taking responsibility for managing a transition that's been underway for 20 years. Under the previous government, in the period that covered their time on this side of the chamber between 2012 and 2022, more or less—they were in government from 2013 to 2022—the live sheep trade declined by 75 per cent in that period alone. The sheep flock in WA remained exactly the same at 13½ million head, and the wool output at 65 million tonnes remained exactly the same in that period. There was a 75 per cent decline on their watch in a trade that has declined by more than 90 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of Western Australian agriculture. It is a vital part of the national economy. It's a vital part of my state's cultural and social fabric. It's strong today; it will remain strong. Last year, we set sheepmeat export records. Meat and Livestock Australia have said that they expect that to grow in 2024. The fact is that agriculture changes over time. Agriculture improves over time. That's the history of Australian agriculture, and that's the approach of Australian farmers who always want to be more productive, more effective, more humane and more sustainable. That is the story of Australian agriculture, and it continues to be the story, and that's why the live sheep export trade is on its way out. It has been on its way out for more than 20 years. We are doing the responsible thing which governments do, and that is to help manage change—not to bury your head in the sand, not to tell people stories, not to be in denial about the past and not to be in denial about the future but to look the facts squarely in the eye and take responsibility for managing change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our largest market is China. Last year, of chilled and frozen exports to China, lamb was up 30 per cent and mutton was up 70 per cent. In our second-largest market, the Middle East and North Africa, sheepmeat was up 63 per cent. These are record sheepmeat exports from Australia, the largest sheepmeat exporter in the world. Why? Because we've seen a 400 per cent increase in chilled and frozen and humanely, Australian processed sheepmeat of higher value—and more jobs—out of this country at the same time that the live sheep export trade has dropped off a cliff. It has declined by 90 per cent on its own terms. Why? Because it's not the way the world's going. It doesn't make sense, and unfortunately it has always involved animal suffering, and that animal suffering continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2018, when the previous government were dragged to make changes that the Moss review and the McCarthy review said had to be made, 60 per cent of all voyages that have had independent observers have involved unacceptable levels of heat stress, and heat stress is now the accepted measure of animal welfare in this country. That is the case today. Anyone who says that the trade is vital is wrong. Anyone who says that the trade is a significant part of Western Australian agriculture, when it's worth less than one per cent of Western Australian agriculture—it's worth less than 0.1 per cent of Australian agriculture. Anyone who makes that claim is wrong. Anyone who says that the industry has overcome the intrinsic, chronic and occasionally acute animal welfare problems is wrong. And those opposite know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When those opposite came to government, what did they do? They got rid of the animal welfare advisory council, they disbanded the animal welfare unit within the department of agriculture and they abandoned our proposition to create an independent inspectorate of animal welfare. And what happened? In 2017 there was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>, just the latest in a parade, really, of animal welfare atrocities that the Australian community will not accept. They will not accept it. We don't allow our animal welfare standards and the treatment of Australian animals to be set by anyone else but us, and the Australian community does not take the view that some might take that there's a sliding scale that makes animal cruelty acceptable at a certain price. The Australian community will not accept that, and they don't have to, because this industry has been going through this transition for a long period of time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We remain the largest exporter of sheepmeat in the world, and that will only grow because chilled and frozen boxed exports are rising and all of the markets that we export to are taking that product. Kuwait is cited by those opposite. It is the largest importer of live export product, but they already take more than twice as much in processed meat. That is the case for Kuwait. That's the way the world's going. We are responsibly managing that change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  On 14 May, federal budget night, the Treasurer, the member for Rankin, went to that spot and adjusted his red tie, and in his budget he announced the biggest spend for agriculture would be that he would pay farmers to stop farming. He would pay farmers to stop farming. Wouldn't you think that a government which wanted to be there and wanted to govern for everybody would at least have something in the budget which would help those people who the member for O'Connor quite correctly thanked—and we should thank our farmers every day, three times a day. They grow the food and they grow the fibre that puts food on our table and clothes on our back, not just for us but for many other countries besides. Yet the biggest item of expenditure in the federal budget this year was to pay farmers to stop farming—$107 million to Western Australian sheep farmers to stop doing what they're doing. That is a disgrace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got a little bit of advice, too, for the member for Eden-Monaro. In the next election, under the new New South Wales federal boundaries, she is going to take over Goulburn. That's if she wins her seat. Goulburn, since 1985, have had one of those 'big' things—many of our cities and towns across Australia have them—and for Goulburn it's a big merino. They are very proud of their sheep production. For her to say that the Labor government is bringing the farmers certainty—well, I'll agree with her; she's very right on that. They are bringing to the Western Australian sheep farmers a certain end, and this is just beyond belief, because our farmers are the very best in the world. We are also telling the world that their business is not good enough for Australia. What we're telling the Gulf States is, quite frankly, the insult that we no longer want to trade with them, just like in June 2011 we told our Indonesian friends—one of the largest, if not the largest, importers of our cattle—that we didn't want their business any longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Mahar, Chief Executive Officer of the National Farmers Federation, had this to say in a recent media release:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's political decision to end live exports showed scant regard for its own departmental advice, and caused widespread financial damage, family breakups, and even suicide among those impacted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not want to do that to our WA sheep farmers. Paul Brown, speaking today in this building, said that this will have an effect on the sheep industry. He said it will have an effect on families and on people's mental health. He knows full well the impacts of this sort of thing. He ran a feedlot which didn't do that well, and he said that he was very affected by it. He was very emotional when he spoke. We also heard also from Mark Harvey-Sutton, from the Australian Livestock Exporters Council. He was talking about the 31 May rally in Perth, and he said he's never seen anything like it in his life. The cars and the sheep-transporting trucks extended 20 kilometres long. This rally, he said, created solidarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every agriculture body supports the Keep the Sheep campaign, and the Keep the Sheep campaign is coming to the electorates of WA members. The WA members need to heed the warning that the member for Curtin very much listened to when she got up and spoke in support of the legislation to ban live sheep exports and then voted against it. Why did she vote against it? It was because people power came to an electorate office near her, and people power will come to an electorate office near those other WA members. They want to keep the sheep, and so they should. Despite what the member for Fremantle tells us, the animal husbandry—the animal welfare standards—on those ships was world's best practice. We are the only country in the world to have that exporter supply chain assurance system in place. Every one of those sheep was well looked after. The animal husbandry was first class, with veterinarians on board. We looked after the sheep. It's a pity Labor didn't do the same for our farmers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I stand proudly today as the member for Paterson in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, which has a lot of agriculture, but I'm even more proud to be the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture. I want to take a moment to thank all of the committee members that joined me to conduct the advisory review of the legislation that went through the parliament last night to end live sheep exports here in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another life I worked in talkback radio, and I can tell members of this House that this is the issue that, in recent decades, has received by far the most incoming correspondence. Whether people are for or against the export of live sheep, it is something that brings up a lot of emotion. I can still remember those days on the radio, talking to people about this practice. I received a lot of calls, and, interestingly, they were not just from 'woke inner-city greenie types', who have been labelled as the vegan underground trying to cut live sheep export—</span>

                  </a>  The member for Sydney has just arrived, but I'm certainly not directing my comments at her! Over those years of talking about live sheep export, I had many calls from farmers themselves, who said: 'You know what? Eventually we won't be doing this anymore. We care for our animals. We love our animals, and we do not want them to be subjected to cruelty.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Australian farmers are some of if not the most innovative people across the globe. They know this change is coming. They themselves have been part of the change for the last three decades. We have seen an industry in decline. Some members opposite have said, 'Well, if it's declining, why didn't you just leave it to decline?' Because we are a responsible government. We take notice of the industry and farmers. We know that they need assistance with this transition, and that's why we've put up $107 million. As part of this review of the legislation, the agriculture committee have requested that the government have a look at that package with an eye to increasing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like my fellow committee members, I travelled to Muresk, and I want to take a moment to thank people from the Muresk Institute. The member for Durack came along as the local member. I want to take a moment to thank those people who came. Over 3½ thousand people came. Admittedly, a lot of those people were upset by the decision, but we turned up and we listened, and I'm pleased that we went there. It was actually very important. That's why we have said, 'Yes, we need to assist the industry in the transaction.' We know that it will mean change. But this industry has already been changing, and what we are doing is the responsible thing, the thing that responsible governments do. They recognise when change is coming and they manage it, unlike those opposite, who just turn a blind eye and say, 'We'll just let this industry wither on the vine; we'll just let it die on the boat.' We won't stand for that. We won't stand for the animal cruelty. We won't leave our farmers high and dry. We will be working for them and with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disingenuous for those opposite to say, 'Oh, we're sticking up for our industry. We're doing the right thing by them. We understand it,' when actually they're not. If they were supporting this industry, they would be helping them. They understand that at the moment we are exporting the same number of sheep in 12 months that are processed in four days across Australia. Roger Fletcher, one of the biggest meat processors across the country, gave evidence to our committee that said we will be able to process the same number of sheep that go on those boats, many of them under incredible duress, in four days. Not only that; we will be able to create good jobs in Australia. We'll be able to increase the boxed meat that goes offshore.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say to those people who are very concerned about their future, we do get it. We do understand. We want to make Australian agriculture even more prosperous and sustainable for the future. We do want to work with you. The future is coming fast, and those opposite deny it.</span>

Those opposite, at the last election, promised to stand up for Western Australia, yet last night they sold out our state because of this government's desire, purely this government's desire, to curry favour with inner city voters. Not only was this decision reckless, as the MPI suggests; it was shameful. The live sheep trade in WA predates Federation. It is a truly Western Australian industry that has done absolutely everything that has been asked of it to improve animal welfare standards and more. In fact, our live export industry leads the world, in terms of animal welfare standards, a fact even the minister of agriculture has acknowledged.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to those opposite: don't dare try and pretend that the banning of live sheep exports is anything to do with animal welfare standards. Our WA farmers just want to keep doing their jobs and feeding the world. It is a noble occupation. I have been absolutely disgusted at the insults that have been levelled at our WA farmers, our WA truckies, our WA rousies and more by extremist animal rights activists and those who sit on the opposite side.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often talk about the difficulty of getting people to work, yet here we have some 3,000 Australians who are being forced out of their industry and, probably, out of our towns. This will impact the local shops, the local sporting groups and, of course, our local schools. While the legislation has passed, let me tell you that the fight is far from over. I want to acknowledge my friend and colleague the member for O'Connor, who is here with me as well. We are up for this fight. Regional Western Australia, let me tell you, doesn't give up that easily, so be warned.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The grassroots Keep the Sheep campaign is well and truly up and running in Western Australia, and a few weeks ago I was so pleased to join the rally which went through Perth CBD. I was so touched by the support that was provided to our farmers, our regional Western Australians, by the people of metropolitan Perth. I say to them, 'You need to keep supporting your farmers, because they need your support now more than ever.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keep the Sheep have said that if they couldn't change policy, which sadly they were unable to do, then they would change the government. Well, they are now planning to mobilise and target the Western Australian Labor members, who failed to stand up for Western Australia. In just a few short weeks 63,000 Australians have signed the Keep the Sheep petition. Unfortunately, at least one Labor member threw those words back in their faces. 'We are keeping the sheep,' the member for Hasluck posted on her social media last week. 'This means more than 3,000 new jobs for the regions,' she said, with a smile on her face. Honestly, the arrogance, the ignorance and the disrespect of those opposite is beyond belief. Do the member for Hasluck and the rest of those on the other side of the House honestly believe that they know better than the farmers and the communities themselves what is good for farmers and regional communities?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it has been a tough week, but I want to recommit to my Durack community that my coalition colleagues and I are committed more than ever to reinstating the trade. We will always have your back. But you have to ask yourself: if it is sheep today, what is next? Will it be cattle tomorrow? People in my electorate are good farmers, pastoralists. They feed us, they employ us and they support our communities. We are eternally grateful for them and we are fighting with them every day. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  For those listening, it is unusual to have such a fiery discussion on matters of public importance. These discussions generally are quite self-serving. But in this case this is a matter of deep significance to Western Australian farmers, because our farming and agriculture sector is a critical part of the Western Australian economy. Every Western Australian is deeply connected to the farming sector. We have family, we have friends, and it is a place in which we visit and spend our time, so this really does matter and it is important that we have this robust debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is also important that we keep the facts on the table. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of rhetoric and a lot of misinformation, not just from those opposite but from leaders within the farming bodies, such as the National Farmers Federation, who are seeing this as an opportunity to wedge a government that is actually doing its best to work with the farming community and help them succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of the live sheep export market is that it has been in decline. It is worth 90 per cent less than it was just a few years ago. We have a sheep industry in Western Australia that is valued at over $4.6 billion, and the live sheep export component is $77 million. That is still a significant amount of money to the very different small communities across the wheatbelt that it supports. It is money that we don't want to see lost. The reality is that we don't want a situation in Western Australia which is different to that on the east coast, which stopped live sheep trading many years past and got into processing sheepmeat domestically—because that's where the value is. They got into that years ago; they saw the writing on the wall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Western Australia is a bit more unique, because there is such a lack of competition. For 10 years, when those opposite had the chance to correct the imbalance between suppliers—the farmers, who are price takers—and the supermarket chains and the processors, they actually did nothing. They did nothing because they do take the farmers for granted. They think, 'They'll vote for us; we don't need to be concerned about what they think.' But we actually do care. We appreciate what they give to us city folk—the 'city elite' and whatnot else insults those opposite refer to us as. We do care, because they're the people who keep the food on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they aren't getting a fair price; farmers are not getting a fair price. And it's to this end that the transition package the Labor government is proposing supports the farmers—so they actually come out better from this. The industry is in decline; it will go the same way that it has gone in other countries—and particularly as we've seen on the east coast. We want to make sure now and over the next four years that we get the processing capability and get the feedlots covered so they can take on sheep when, ordinarily, they would be turned away—and also that we increase capacity with cold storage facilities within the abattoirs. They're overbooked presently, which basically means that the farmers get an even a weaker price because there's too much supply. So we need to increase the capacity of those abattoirs. Equally, there needs to be competition between the abattoirs, because there isn't at the moment. At the moment, farmers are left wanting; they haven't been adequately represented or able to fight to ensure that funding is directed towards improving manufacturing capacity for multiple gradings so there's a choice about where they go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that farmers take advantage of the offer extended by veterinarians to work on cross genetics. This is to ensure that merino genetics—obviously, produced predominantly for wool, which we value—are taken account of so that they're also suitable for processed meat and the mutton market, which is significant. We heard, loud and clear, from the various meat industry representatives about market growth, particularly for mutton, in China and also in the Middle East. That market obviously loves the meat, because it's purchasing it live—but only four per cent, mind. The global live sheep export market provided by Western Australia is four per cent of the global live sheep trade. We've heard about the huge impact it has, but it actually isn't: the majority of meat they purchase is from a supermarket. The growth undertaken on the east coast is fantastic and significant, and Western Australian farmers have been missing out all this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to change that. We want to look after those communities which look after us, and we want to ensure that we spend the next four years in skilling up more people to work in those abattoirs and making sure that there are washdown facilities, because there will be more truck movements as they go from feedlot to farms, abattoirs and so forth, rather than just to a ship. There is so much more opportunity that comes with this change. But change is tough, and we have farmers' backs, because that is what Labor stands for.</span>

Why don't those on that side just say, 'I don't know any details about this. I know we're going to get votes for it'? But we had a patronising contribution like that one! The member opposite just said that, to get a better price for farmers, we're going to reduce one of the markets for their sheep, which is for live sheep.</span>

                  </a>  Yes—I don't know what market that would be. And, oh, yes, she said that the market has declined. Does the member know how many sheep crossed the Nullarbor after the eastern states' drought? One of the reasons fewer sheep moved out of Western Australia was that they were put on road trains and moved across. One of the reasons that Roger Fletcher can process so many sheep now is that the eastern states' flock was built by buying sheep from Western Australia a couple of years ago. But does the member over there know anything about that? We're talking about boats here. They've all jumped on this 'stop the sheep' boat and there aren't enough lifeboats. You've already hit the iceberg, and you're going down. This is a political decision, and any attempt by those opposite to make out that it's anything else, that it's about animal welfare—well! They say: 'It's because we care for farmers. We went to Western Australia, and we listened to the farmers, and we did nothing; we just listened to them.' Seriously! The member for Fremantle said, 'Oh, this is only one per cent of the product of Western Australia.' But it's 100 per cent for some of those farmers that are getting cut off. We are just going to sacrifice them at the altar of feeling good about ourselves.</span>

                  </a>  I am not even sure where the member is from, but I'm sure he knows a lot about this. These sheep are put on ships. They are cared for, fed and air conditioned. There are vets on board. They arrive, and they get to the other end in a healthy condition, and they supply a market. This idea that we have a processed market or a live sheep market—one or the other. We need both. What happened to the idea in this country of actually increasing our markets? We can kill more sheep and sell them to the chilled and frozen meat market. It doesn't mean that we have to shut down another industry to do that. It doesn't mean we have to do that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no concept of the farming systems where these sheep come from. These are wheat and sheep mixed farming operations where the sheep play a very important role in having rotations on those farms so that they use fewer chemicals and less fertiliser, and they fit just nicely into that market. To have that ripped out like this—I saw this with the cattle. Overnight, we saw this with the cattle. I think I got 170 emails in one night on the cattle, from people in the cities. Not only did that devastate and is still devastating the northern Australia industry; that flew right down through the eastern states to Victoria, devastating that cattle market, and this decision is going to do the same. </span>

You won't be able to take me to Western Australia or anywhere else in 2028 and point to a sheep that's somehow healthier, is better cared for or has a better life. Are we going to have maybe a book club for sheep in Western Australia so they can expand their minds because they are not going to be put on boats and sent off to the Middle East?

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think this trade in sheep is a shame and a stain on our international reputation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Goodness me, that's a very strong statement. That one had a bit of muscle. This person went on, and they said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This has been a trade marked by disaster—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">goodness me, this person doesn't like the live sheep export industry—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">following debacle and that's gone on for 33 years, it's had a very sad history, a very dismal history.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not my words. I wouldn't be using those words. That's the member for Farrer, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. She absolutely came out swinging in 2018. In fact, she was so angry that she wrote an opinion piece about it. You'd think that maybe she'd take that opinion piece down from her website. No, she is that angry, it's still up there. It's still up there for all to see the member for Farrer's very strong views about live sheep exports. The member for Farrer went on in this op-ed and made some very interesting points. She said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Middle East is transitioning away from live sheep—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">which is true. She said that the dynamic has changed, and live sheep export is a significantly small percentage of our total sheep export. That's not me speaking; that's the member for Farrer on her website, and the op-ed that she wrote. She went on to acknowledge:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Moving away from the live trade is not straightforward for West Australian farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said herself:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill gives time, and it also gives a comprehensive transition package. As the Prime Minister outlined today, there have been conversations going on, and those conversations will continue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Farrer had much more to say. She said that there is a market opportunity for Australian grown meat in the Middle East and around the world. She acknowledged that our quality and standards are trusted, so why would we put that at risk? That was the member for Farrer, not me. The member for Farrer concluded—this really had some muscle to it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Producing food and fibre in the 21st century requires ethics and sustainability.  The live sheep trade to the Middle East has neither.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Goodness me, she really wanted to make some points in her op-ed. She was very unhappy. </span>

Those opposite should also know that we came into the election with a commitment to end live sheep exports. Through that process, we have acted like a responsible government and engaged with industry and put a timeline in. It is not tomorrow; there is time. There are years. It will be beyond the next election—probably beyond the next two elections. But that bill has been passed into law, and it should come as no surprise to those opposite. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another bill, actually. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition put in her own private member's bill to end live sheep exports. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition really didn't want live sheep exports. She really didn't want them, but something changed. Something changed for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and it miraculously made her bill disappear. Who can guess what that is? </span>

                  </a>  She was promoted back into the cabinet—a bit of a promotion and all of a sudden it's 'What bill?' It disappeared more quickly than the night sky after the sun rises in the morning. It just went away. But it wasn't just her. It was also a senator in the other place. Senator Sarah Henderson co-sponsored the live sheep export private member's bill. So there are many people among those opposite who are being quiet right now. While those opposite like to come up and rant and rave and stamp their feet, the bill that we passed through the parliament was the right thing to do; the cruelty needed to end. Those opposite should speak to each other before criticising those on this side of the House. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are around 4,000 to 5,000 war memorials across Australia that have been erected to honour and commemorate Australia's war dead over the last century. Small grieving towns and large cities alike erected these memorials in the wake of the calamity of the First World War. Sixty thousand Australians perished in the First World War, a huge number of men killed for such a young and relatively small nation. Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey, in his <span style="font-style:italic;">A Shorter History of Australia</span>, put it like this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Perhaps the most drastic effect of the war would never be enumerated: it was the loss of all those talented Australians who would have become prime ministers and premiers, judges, divines, engineers, teachers, doctors, poets, inventors and farmers, the mayors of towns and leaders of trade unions, and the fathers of another generation of Australians. It was a war in which those with the gift of leadership, the spark of courage, and the willingness to make sacrifices often took the highest risks. A young nation could not afford to lose such men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Geoffrey Blainey wrote that that's why we responded in the way we did, with so many memorials across our great country. He continued:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No nation in Europe showed such a visible desire to remember, to honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've added to those memorials with subsequent wars. We fought in the Second World War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and, more recently, the Afghan war. All those wars, sadly, have led to the loss of more Australian men and women in service. We have 103,000 war dead remembered on those memorials across this nation. It's a reminder that this nation has sacrificed greatly and has borne the cost of war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Australian War Memorial was built and opened on Remembrance Day in 1941 and why Anzac Parade was opened on Anzac Day in 1965 by Sir Robert Menzies. Anzac Parade is lined with memorials on both sides: the Hellenic Memorial, the Kemal Ataturk Memorial, the Army, Navy and Air Force memorials, the Service Nurses Memorial, the Rats of Tobruk Memorial, the Boer War, Vietnam War and Korean War memorials, and the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial. The architecture and design of all those memorials remind us of sacrifice. They remind us of sacrifice and the values of our fighting men and women—the values of service, courage, respect, integrity and excellence. These are Australian values and our ADF are their custodians. If you go to the ADF website, you will see those values listed out: service, courage, respect, integrity and excellence. Australians have fought for these values, Australians have died for these values and our memorials reflect these values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the ugly defacement and desecration of our war memorials is so disgraceful. It dishonours our war dead, and this, sadly, is a pattern that has emerged over the last six months. We saw, on 11 November last year, the Melbourne war memorial vandalised on Remembrance Day. On 12 January 2024 we saw the Tasmanian war memorial vandalised. On 11 March we saw the Vietnam War Memorial vandalised. In May this year we saw the Hyde Park Anzac Memorial vandalised after protests. Red dye was poured into the Pool of Reflection. On 14 June 2024 the Australian War Memorial was vandalised with pro-Palestinian slogans. Just on the weekend, the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam War Memorial and the Army Memorial on Anzac Parade were vandalised. This vandalism represents something far deeper and grotesque. This vandalism is an attack on our Australian values, but it's also an attack on our way of life. It's an attack on the thing that binds us together—a shared heritage of service and sacrifice, something that on 25 April, Anzac Day, every year all Australians come together and focus on as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, sadly, it goes even deeper than that. On the Vietnam and Korean war memorials were written phrases like this: 'They didn't die so we could fund genocide,' 'Free Gaza,' 'Blood on your hands,' 'Free Palestine,' and, the most disgraceful, 'From the river to the sea'—a deeply anti-Semitic slogan with origins in violent terrorism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, 'from the river to the sea' has its origins in the Hamas charter of 2017. Hamas is a terrorist organisation listed by the Australian Commonwealth. It is committed to the destruction of the Jewish people and the state of Israel. It is an organisation driven by extreme religious ideology that celebrates death, violence and hatred. They are people who will not compromise. Just in case people don't believe this, I'll make it very clear; I'm going to read now from the 2017 Hamas charter, their document of general principles and policies. Paragraph 20 says this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hamas believes that no part of the land of Palestine shall be compromised or conceded, irrespective of the causes, the circumstances and the pressures and no matter how long the occupation lasts. Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And here are the words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… from the river to the sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas represents the worst of humanity. We've all heard it said: 'By a fruit its tree shall be known.' On 7 October, we saw the poisonous and evil fruit of Hamas's ideology on full display when they attacked, murdered and raped more than 1,000 innocent Israelis on that terrible day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now we have Australians defacing our war memorials with phrases straight out of the Hamas charter. In this country now we are seeing mob rule challenge the rule of law. In this country now, we are seeing mob rule challenge the rule of law. We are seeing the mob tear apart our social cohesion. We are seeing the mob challenge the values that define our nation. And we are seeing the mob trample on our war dead and the values they died for. Everyone here on this side of the House condemns in the strongest possible terms this vile, disgraceful, destructive, divisive and un-Australian behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all been touched in some way or other by 7 October. I think of some Jewish friends in Melbourne who I came to know through this tragedy—a couple who are living in my electorate of Canning, who contacted me soon after 7 October. I'll leave their names off the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>in order to protect them, because they feel unsafe. They are Jewish Australians, and the female's mother was killed by Hamas on 7 October. She'd just rung her up to let her know she was pregnant. Her brother was killed protecting his family, and her 10-month-old niece was brutally murdered. I think of her when I read 'from the river to the sea'. As an Australian, how must she feel having suffered so badly at the hands of evil terrorism? It fills me with shame. It fills all of us with shame. That's why we raise this today in the House. I say it again—we condemn this in the strongest possible terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an isolated pattern of behaviour. We're seeing electoral offices across the country also targeted. We've seen the Prime Minister's office besieged by protestors chanting the same sorts of things. We've seen the Deputy Prime Minister, the Attorneys-General, the minister for immigration, the minister for NDIS, the member for Franklin, the member for Wills, the member for Cooper, the member for Jagajaga, the member for Macnamara and the member for Riverina—I could go on. This is a pattern of behaviour which is tearing at the cohesion of this country. We're seeing our universities encamped by protesters who are willing to chant the same slogans that we find in the Hamas charter. We're seeing this at the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne, Monash University, the University of Adelaide, the University of Queensland, the Australian National University, Deakin University, Curtin University, RMIT University, La Trobe University, the University of Wollongong and the University of Tasmania. We have a rot at the heart of Australian society right now, and we have young Australians who are chanting terrorist slogans and defacing our war memorials. It's got to stop. It requires political leadership, and that's why we're raising this issue right now. We believe this issue demands political leadership, and we want to ensure that our law enforcement agencies across the states feel that they have our backing to enforce the rule of law, to arrest these people and to prosecute these people, and send a message that modern Australia, with all its diversity, will only cohere if people respect each other, respect the rule of law and uphold the Australian values that I've outlined today. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New </span><span class="HPS-Electorate">England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I second the motion. Deputy Speaker, when we go to a war memorial, we see names. We see your name; we see Chesters. We see the names Leigh, Buchholz and Pearce. We see the names of people of Czech descent. We see the names of so many people—McCormack. They're just names, but they're so much more. They represent people. They represent people who walked down your street. They represent people who took shade under your tree, who swam in your river and who went to your local primary school. They were people who were loved. They were people who had wives and people who had girlfriends, people who had mates and, later on, people who had husbands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were not superhumans. They had all the reasons not to go to war. They had all the reasons to stay at home, where it was safe. But nonetheless they did. They went and they fought, and so many of them gave their lives. That was it. There was nothing more for them. They were dead. Others came back maimed or psychologically disturbed. And then, beyond that, some came back and the marriage was over—no more marriage. Or they came back and they were just forgotten about, to later die and be buried in a pauper's grave, unmarked. Or life had just gone on without them, their careers left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For so many, all that is left is their name on that memorial. That is it. And, for that, in the Australian context they are sacred. They are sacred. For so many of us, it is your grandfather, your great-grandfather, your granduncle, your son, your daughter, your mum or your dad. It's the connection to that. 'That's all I've got. All I've got left is that name.' I had seven granduncles killed—seven. Every one of my grandmother's brothers—dead. They were English; they weren't Australian. The desecration is abominable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father wouldn't even let you draw a swastika. You were not allowed to—not on a German plane; nothing—because symbols matter. Symbols matter. What you draw matters. He was a returned serviceman. He was repatriated. He was smashed up. These are the things where we have to make a stand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On those war memorials are the names of Catholics, Protestants, Jews and gentiles, Christians and people of the Islamic faith. Every name is there. My grandfather fought with innumerable people of the Islamic faith, absolutely, at Gallipoli—surrounded by them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about this, a person decided to sneak out in the night with a can of spray paint. Do you know why they sneaked out in the middle of the night? Because he or she was scared. That is why they sneaked out. Scared of what—the police? What would the police do? They would arrest you. And then he or she sprayed the anarchy sign, in most instances, on our war memorials for these people. But guess what they went out against? They faced the fire coming the other direction. They had real fear they could die—die at Gallipoli, die on the Western Front, die at Guadalcanal, die in Papua New Guinea, die in Korea, die in Afghanistan, die in Vietnam. They had real fear, and they would have felt that fear; they would not have been immune from it. And their families will mourn their loss forevermore. The only thing left for those families is that piece of brass with their families' names on it. And someone—some piece of filth—has decided that their issue allows them to desecrate it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I start my contribution in responding to the motion just moved by the member for Canning by making it very clear that the government's position is entirely supportive of the sentiments raised and the position espoused in the substantive motion the member for Canning seeks to bring forward today; that's an important point to make. The second point I make in relation to that is that has been made abundantly clear by the answer given by the Prime Minister in question time yesterday in relation to this issue, as well by as the speech made before question time today by the member for Spence and a number of speeches that were made by Labor senators in respect of a motion moved by Senator Lambie on Monday; that's an important thing to recognise. It's unfortunate, however, in these circumstances that this motion has been brought on with no notice to the government. But the sentiments are entirely supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To pick up on a point that was being made by the member for New England just now, when we look around our communities all across Australia, in mine, in the park in the centre of Armadale in Western Australia—a town that grew because of the brickworks in Armadale—and in Byford, in the member for Canning's electorate, there is a war memorial made not of stone, not of granite, but of brick. It lists the names of the people from our community for whom there are named streets, parks, suburbs, buildings and lakes. That memorial is a 'who's who' directory of our geography. That is true of every memorial around the country. It's why the official war historian for the First World War, Charles Bean, was such an advocate for the creation of the Australian War Memorial in the first place—so that those men that fought in the First World War always knew that what they fought and died for would never be forgotten, that their lives would never have been given in vain. That is true of every war memorial that has come after it. It's particularly poignant for wars that are sometimes overlooked by mainstream Australia and global history, like the Korean War. It's even more important for memorials that stand in memoriam of, dedication to and commemoration of the lives lost and the efforts made by Australians who fought in a war that was so politically contested at the time, like the Vietnam War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thread that runs through all these war memorials is that these are people that walked away from their families, from their loved ones, from their jobs and from their lives, put on a uniform for our nation at the direction of their government and, for many, made the ultimate sacrifice. They did it because they were committed to our values. Those are values of democracy, freedom of speech and freedom of political communication. They are the values that enable peaceful protests to occur in our country in the first place. For anybody to use that freedom to desecrate a war memorial is an abuse of the freedom we have been granted and awarded through the sacrifice that has been made by those people that have died or fought in our name. That is what makes what has occurred not just this week but a number of times now at different memorials not just in Canberra, in our nation's capital, but in other places around Australia so absolutely abhorrent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to refer to who those people are and I'm not going to refer to what they said, because I don't want to amplify what they are trying to message through their actions. What I seek to do is to condemn what they have done, because it cuts against the exact freedom that they are espousing and it cuts against the exact freedom they are afforded in being able to exercise those free democratic rights in every other way that they or anyone else may seek to raise their cause in this country. That is what makes what has happened here not just truly abhorrent but problematic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying all of that, it confirms exactly what the member for Canning has sought to do by bringing forward this motion today and it confirms why Senator Lambie brought forward her motion at the beginning of the week. That motion was supported by the government, and the sentiments were supported by the Prime Minister in his answer in question time yesterday, in the speech made by the member for Spence, in the public comments made by the Minister for Defence on Sunday and in the comments that I have made previously in relation to these things occurring at other memorials. I think both sides of this House and many on the crossbench join together in those sentiments. It is deeply concerning to me that there was a political party in the Senate that voted against that motion on Monday. I think we all agree with that. For that reason, and certainly to avoid a repeat of that, I move:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  In continuation, I was talking about the inception of online social media platforms and I wondered which one of the creators or executives in charge of these platforms decided that it was perfectly fine to expose our very young children to a free-for-all in what is an online paedophile's paradise. And I'll repeat that: a paradise where our children would be groomed online by sexual predators and exposed to extreme and violent pornography. That's what's available on their platforms to be exposed to billions of random people of all ages. But that is part of the platform business model and what's available to vulnerable young people on these platforms and these apps, exposing our young people 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The harm is there for all to see and for our families to have to deal with—from the bullying with the sharing of naked and semi-naked photos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Snapchat, which young people were sucked into—that's a nice way of putting it—they thought they could take provocative images and they would disappear. Well, they didn't. There was an app called SnapSave that automatically saved all of these photos, and people took screenshots. So many young people I've dealt with have been affected by this and the image based abuse that follows that—the suicides because of what's going on on social media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, we have seen young boys with image based abuse. We have seen increased rates of self-harm over the years, as well as the dramatic increase of hospitalisations of girls in the last decade because of this and the group chats and sites promoting everything from eating disorders to risky behaviours. We did see, some years ago, that dreadful choking game. We've seen such a rise in mental health problems, which I've repeatedly spoken about in this House before. We now see the online gaming addiction and the clinics that have had to be set up to help families deal with online addictions, as well as the risks on these apps with tracking and mapping. There are young girls presenting to GPs with internal damage from aggressive sexual experiences learned from online pornography sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These same platforms and representatives still believe, according to some of the evidence we saw recently, that they're doing no harm. I can tell them differently. I do cybersafety presentations in schools, and how dreadful it is that, through that interaction on social media and through these sites, the person of the youngest age so far, in all of the years I have been doing this, who will admit to me they've been to meet people in person that they've only first met online is a year 3 girl. I'll let that sink in—it was a year 3 girl, in all those classes and sessions that I've done over the years. When I do my silent survey and they put their hands up for the three critical questions, it is completely unusual to come across a class, of various ages—I've done from preschool through to year 12—in which there are not some children who have gone to meet people in person that they've only first met online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've dealt with an extraordinary amount of issues created by these online platforms, who claim that they're doing no harm. That is entirely incorrect. The harm to these young people is done every single day and night. It isn't okay when we see GPS or location services and geotagging turned on and embedded in the photos that young people share. Then they get tracked and mapped. It is not okay that we have four-year-olds being encouraged and conned into uploading totally inappropriate content. It's not okay when the mum of a nine-year-old girl rings my office because her daughter has uploaded an explicit video on one of these sites. I can just see the risks with AI generated images and particularly sexual images. This legislation is so important in that space because we will see a rise in the instances of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The harm to young people is constant. When I listen to these young people and ask them questions about what they do, how much time they spend online, where their devices are and how much time they can spend on them, it is almost unlimited. And so their level of risk in this space is extreme. Of course, the gaming chats in so many of the messaging platforms—it is just ongoing, and they're asked all sorts of questions in this space. When I look at the ages of the young people I've dealt with—and it's much younger than people think—one of the things I say to these good, young people is: 'Can you help your families? If you've got younger brothers and sisters, they are at risk in this space. You are in this as a family, and the whole family needs to be involved in what's happening online to help keep your family safe.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've dealt with some terrible experiences that young people have had. When you meet these young people—I had a group of great young kids that were 15 and 16, and they came to talk to me to tell me how concerned they were about the nine-year-olds in their school that they knew were watching and live streaming sex acts in school time. What those young people were seeing and having access to is why age verification is so important, which we have been pushing for for some time. It's a start. It doesn't give all of the answers, but it is certainly a start. There have been extraordinary experiences that young people have been subjected to, and it has really harmed their whole lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is one of the other issues that I just want to warn people about as well. I had a visit recently from the optometrists at Optometry Australia. We are seeing an increase in myopia, short-sightedness, because of the amount of time young people are spending before a screen. Not only is there physical harm and emotional harm, with young people going to meet people in person they only first met online, but what's happening to them with bullying and image based abuse is constant. When I spoke to one principal and said, 'What is the biggest issue facing your year 12 students?' he held up the phone and said, 'They're just not sleeping enough.' And they cannot cope with every other issue in their lives—their relationships, what's going on at school, what they intend to do when they leave school—because of what's happening online. They're engaging with it for so much of the night that they're simply not sleeping enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I've been very active in this space for a lot of years. What the government is proposing here in relation to deepfake images—I think what we're going to see ahead is even worse because of this. I hope that people use these laws and that the laws are suitable for them to be used far more often. The issues that these young people have to deal with, with deepfakes, the issues around consent and how the courts will interpret and act on this, are very important to our young people and people of all ages.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr </span>
                    </a>
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">LIM</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  Today, I rise to present on a crucial piece of legislation on behalf of the Albanese Labor government. The Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024 is a bill that addresses a rapidly growing threat to privacy, dignity and safety—the non-consensual sharing of deepfake sexually explicit material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former police officer who has witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of digital manipulation on individuals' lives, I can attest to the urgent need for these reforms. Digitally created and altered sexually explicit material, particularly deepfakes, represents a sinister form of abuse that targets women and girls. It not only violates their privacy but also inflicts deep emotional and psychological harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the proposed amendment to the Criminal Code Act 1995, we are taking decisive action to modernise our law and impose serious penalties on those who perpetrate these egregious acts. This legislation introduces new offences specifically targeting the transmission of sexually explicit material without consent utilising technologies like artificial intelligence to create or alter such content. The gravity of these offences is reflected in the penalties we propose: up to six years imprisonment for transmitting sexually explicit material without consent and seven years imprisonment for aggravated offences where the perpetrator also created the material. These penalties underscore our commitment to deterring and punishing those who engage in this disgraceful conduct. This initiative aligns with a broader commitment to combating online harms, particularly those that disproportionately affect women and young girls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government on 1 May 2024 publicly pledged to introduce a comprehensive suite of measures to safeguard vulnerable individuals from digital exploitation and abuse. The amendment proposed in this bill recognises that, assisting the law in adequately addressing artificially generated materials such as deepfakes. By repealing outdated provisions and introducing robust, new offences, we ensure that our legal framework remains responsive to evolving technologies and the harm it can perpetrate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to emphasise that this reform does not infringe on private communications between consenting adults or interfere with lawful sexual relationships. We have carefully crafted specific defences to ensure the legislation targets only non-consensual acts and is proportionate in its application. Moreover, these reforms extend protection to adults depicted in the material, whether it is of a real person or a digital application. This inclusive approach is crucial in safeguarding individuals from the malicious use of technology to degrade, humiliate and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has personally experienced the malicious misuse of technology, I am compelled to share a personal reflection that has shaped my unwavering commitment to these reforms. As a former police officer and now a member of parliament, I have experienced firsthand the distressing misuse of my image and my identity on platforms designed to deceive and defraud. This violation left me feeling helpless and deeply frustrated by the inadequacy of existing legal protections. I have encountered instances where my own image and identity were exploited on scam platforms, subjected to identity theft and used in an attempt to tarnish my reputation. These experiences have deeply informed my understanding of the urgent need for robust protection against digital exploitation and abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation we are proposing today is not just about legal frameworks; it's about safeguarding the identities and reputations of everyday Australians. In a world where modern AI technology is advancing at a rapid, rapid pace, we must put in place strong guardrails and protective mechanisms. Deepfake technology poses a significant threat by allowing the creation of convincing and realistic, but entirely fabricated, images and videos. These can be used to deceive, defame and harm individuals, with devastating consequences. I can only begin to imagine the amplified sense of violation and devastation experienced by individuals, particularly women, who are targeted by deepfake technology for sexually explicit material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deliberate creation and dissemination of manipulated images and videos without consent represents a profound betrayal of trust and flagrant disregard for personal autonomy. The lack of adequate legal safeguards exacerbates the harm inflicted upon victims of such heinous acts. It is incumbent on us, as representatives of the community, to rectify this glaring gap in our legal framework and to provide robust protection against the insidious threat of digital exploitation. The reforms we propose today aren't just about updating statutes; they're about restoring dignity, ensuring justice and fortifying our defences against evolving threats in the digital age. By criminalising the non-consensual sharing of deepfake sexually explicit material, and by imposing significant penalties, we send a clear message that such behaviour will not be tolerated in our society. Moreover, these amendments are testament to our commitment to gender equality and to the protection of vulnerable individuals. They reflect our collective responsibility to dismantle the mechanism of gender based violence, and to empower victims to seek justice and reclaim their narratives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My own encounters with this issue have reinforced my commitment to ensuring that our law evolves to keep pace with technological advancement. The amendments we're presenting to the Criminal Code are crucial steps forward in this regard. By explicitly criminalising the non-consensual sharing of deepfake sexually explicit material, we are sending a clear message that perpetrators will face serious consequences for their actions. It isn't just about protecting privacy; it's about protecting human dignity. The dissemination of manipulated images and videos without consent is a violation that can have profound and lasting effects on victims, perpetrating harm long after the image is shared. Our legislation acknowledges this harm and aims to provide meaningful help for those affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, these reforms are essential in combating the insidious work of scammers and fraudsters, who exploit digital technologies for personal gain. By establishing clear boundaries and penalties, we strengthen our defences against those who seek to deceive and manipulate for malicious purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the passage of this bill is not merely a legal obligation; it is a moral imperative. It sends a clear message that Australia stands firm against digital exploitation and affirms our commitment to protecting the dignity and rights of every Australian. I urge all members of this House to support this vital reform and to stand together in defence of justice, privacy and human dignity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  Artificial intelligence is a technology we don't yet understand or, at best, we are trying desperately to understand. It's very much a black box. Those that engineer it—OpenAI, Google and the like—continue to accelerate its capabilities without true knowledge of how a neural network, AI's underpinning logic, truly works, including how it works functionally and how it works philosophically and ethically. This black box, however, is dual sided. AI presents enormous opportunity as well as risk. The potential exists for even the currently available nascent models to exceed human intelligence in specific areas of knowledge within just the next few years. It also carries the potential to bring vast uncertainty, change and risk to our society. This presents us with a dilemma. How quickly do we allow this technology to develop and be deployed in light of its promise and its perils?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of this, legislators must find the right balance between overregulating this technology too early and underregulating it too late. A first step is acknowledging the nature of how AI foreseeably intersects with almost every aspect of society, from the economy to physics to medicine and, yes, once again, to violence against women. In the case of the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill, the proposed law reflects the urgent need for additional legal measures, particularly to protect women and girls from emerging AI technologies. The unregulated explosion of AI on the internet over the past two years has seen a range of mostly unintended but, in the case of deepfake sexual tools, disgustingly intentional consequences. This legislation addresses one of these consequences—the capacity of this technology to cause humiliation and violence against women online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interim period between the availability of these AI tools and the proposal of this legislation to the House, individuals have been able to, shockingly, create blended images of people they know using templates of naked bodies within seconds. These images have been shared and sold around social networks and social circles. In just the past few weeks, boys of two Melbourne schools have been expelled and arrested for targeting girls in grades 9 to 12 as well as teachers with online sexual deepfake images. Up to 50 girls may have been targeted in one case. Investigations are ongoing; however, it's apparent that these boys took profile images from social media and allegedly uploaded them to free sexual image generation tools on the internet. The images were circulated among school cohorts and have been described as 'incredibly graphic'. One female victim described the lifelong consequences of being targeted, the inability of these images to ever truly be deleted from the internet, the unfair risk they may pose to future employability and the prolonged impact to emotional wellbeing and mental health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to consider the specific impact of this kind of abuse on teenagers, who are particularly vulnerable to bullying, social isolation and feelings of humiliation and lack of self-worth. This behaviour is dehumanising, demeaning and must be prevented. Without a strong legal framework preventing the sharing of this content, we risk normalising the sexualisation of women, including under-age girls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this legislation, but I do have some concerns about its limitation to the transmission of content depicting an individual who is exclusively over the age of 18. While I understand that other legal mechanisms exist to capture content depicting girls under 18, such as child exploitation and pornography laws, more must be done to clearly communicate to boys and men that this behaviour is not just illegal but immoral and unacceptable. I have raised with the Attorney-General my concern about whether teenager-to-teenager deepfake abuse would be captured under existing laws. My concerns were graphically borne out when, subsequent to that conversation, the serious incident involving dozens of girls happened at Bacchus Marsh Grammar outside Melbourne. The Attorney-General says this behaviour is captured, but I do wonder whether the existing legislation regarding child abuse is quite fit for purpose in this evolving space and whether underage deepfake offences should be looked at specifically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">School led educational and awareness programs during the early years of high school are a start, but government can do more—either to legislate or to coordinate across government at all levels. One example is programs and campaigns to make clear that these actions have severe and sometimes lifelong consequences. Another action the Commonwealth could take, as suggested by Asher Flynn, Associate Professor of Criminology at Monash University, involves placing the onus of responsibility of the creators of these AI models and tools. The powers of the government's Online Safety Act could be expanded, including the ability of the eSafety Commissioner to intervene as this content spreads online and across digital platforms. I say that in the knowledge that the Online Safety Act is at risk of becoming an enormously tentacled piece of legislation. We have to make sure it doesn't become impossibly unwieldy, and also that any enforcement is properly resourced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the capability of artificial intelligence is accelerated and deployed by commercial interests into society, Australia and all countries face a challenge to regulate its risks before they're realised. I would like to take this opportunity to endorse the second reading amendment proposed by the member for Warringah. Artificial intelligence is indeed a technology in its nascency, but the capacity exists today for deepfakes to present a risk to the integrity of electoral processes around the world. In a year of democratic elections, and our own in the foreseeable future, this is perhaps more relevant now than ever. Videos of prominent politicians and celebrities, including non-consensual spread of content depicting the likes of Taylor Swift, are already readily accessible online. We will soon find out the capacity for this tool to mislead and misinform electorates here in Australia, because the present capacity for AI to interfere with election integrity is only set to accelerate. Emerging models, such as OpenAI's Sora text-to-video model, present an even more significant challenge for regulators than existing deepfake-generation tools. I strongly suspect that there's a reason that this model will remain publicly unavailable until after the US election in November.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this legislation targets deepfake sexual material only, I think there's a strong argument for banning all deepfakes that are used without permission. Political deepfakery, for example, has the potential to influence voters in insidious and dangerous ways, and can be difficult to debunk. Deepfakes can also be used for identity theft, scams and extortion. AI's capabilities and risks are rapidly accelerating—its engineers understand this—and bold action is required by government if Australia is to safeguard against them. Historically, governments around the world have not been up to this task, being more reactive than proactive. Regrettably, I suspect that this will not be the last time I discuss the societal risk of AI in this House. As well as legislation, tech companies can contribute by using technology to track, trace and prevent deepfakes. Deepfakes are a threat to democracy and public trust, and we must step in strongly to prevent their nefarious use. This legislation, which I will support, is part of that process. </span>

It strengthens existing Commonwealth criminal offences and creates new offences to respond to the online harm caused by deepfakes and other artificially generated sexual material, and we know how vitally important it is to have this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are all aware of instances of AI digital creations and altered images, and it is horrific. Digitally created and altered sexually explicit material that is shared without consent is a damaging and deeply distressing form of abuse. Many of us have seen people in our areas and right across the country who are deeply distressed when this happens. It is an insidious behaviour. It is degrading, humiliating and dehumanising for victims. We know that such acts are overwhelmingly targeted at women and girls, perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and gender based violence. I know that everyone in this House joins with me in the actions that we take, as a government and as a parliament, to end gender based violence, and we have had record commitments when it comes to many investments. It's important to act right across the sphere of all that government can do, and we are in fact doing that in this bill as well, because we know that digitally created explicit material adds to very harmful gender stereotypes. That's why this bill, along with all of our other measures, is vitally important when it comes to all of us working together to end violence against women and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will deliver on a commitment made by the Albanese government following the National Cabinet meeting that was held in May to address gender based violence. This commitment recognises the urgent and collective need to respond to the growing challenges associated with artificially generated sexual material. The bill creates a new offence that applies where a person uses a carriage service to transmit sexual material depicting an adult person and they know the person depicted does not consent to the transmission of the material or they are reckless as to whether the other person consents. The new offence will carry a maximum penalty of six years imprisonment. It will apply to sexual material depicting adults, with child abuse material continuing to be dealt with under very serious, dedicated separate offences in the Criminal Code. The bill repeals previous offences in the code dealing with non-consensual sharing of private sexual material. The new offences are based on a consent model to better cover both artificial and real sexual material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's vitally important to have this legislation in place. As I say, these measures add to the already record amounts of funding that we have put in place, since we came into government, to end violence against women and children in one generation. We have our national plan. We have a major investment in providing frontline services. We have announced in the budget our leaving violence payment, which is now permanent. We are working with all of the states and territories—and we call on all the community, as well, to work with us—with the aim of ending violence against women and children. I know I've spoken on this in the House many times, and I know it's an objective that we all share. That's why taking the action in this bill is vitally important. With the growth of AI and the horrendous depictions that we see, it's important that we pass this bill and that we keep speaking publicly about this and about the action that needs to be taken. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  On 1 May 2024 the Albanese Labor government made a public commitment to introduce a suite of measures to tackle online harms, particularly addressing the harms done to women and girls. Delivering on that promise, we are creating new criminal offences to ban the non-consensual sharing of deepfake pornography. We already know that digitally created and altered sexually explicit material is a damaging form of abuse against women and girls that can inflict deep harm on the victims, but I also want to take this opportunity to highlight the broader issues that we are facing as a society in this respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this parliament is, yes, to make the laws of the land, but we are also required to show leadership, to lead reform on the pressing social issues of the time. And while the current reforms are about making it crystal clear that those who share sexually explicit material without consent using artificial intelligence, AI, will be subject to the most serious criminal penalties, it is also important to continue the national conversation we are having around the safety of women and girls in our society. That is our role here in parliament, and that is what we want to do today in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we have been horrified at the young man at a private school who recently distributed graphic deepfake images of 50 girls in Victoria. This young man did this by taking their likenesses from social media and using an AI app to create sexually explicit deepfakes. He then shared them on social media—obviously without the girls' consent. This was a despicable act of degrading and dehumanising his peers, young women he was supposed to have respected. And it's attitudes like these that, if not rooted out at the earliest opportunity, will go on to perpetuate the stereotypes about women that should have no place in our society because they drive that gender based violence that we abhor in the adult lives of these young men.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the immediate point when these images were shared without consent, they had already damaged, possibly irrevocably, the lives of those victims. This was not just a breach of privacy; it is much more than that. It is really difficult to imagine the feelings of shame, embarrassment, anger and pain that these young women face when these images are shared with others or posted online, and so we want to be extremely clear, in this government, that there is no place for such behaviours. That's why the suite of reforms in these laws are so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Criminal Code to modernise and strengthen offences targeting the non-consensual sharing of sexually explicit material online, especially material produced with the assistance of AI. This includes material that has been created or altered using technology such as deepfakes. Aggravated offences will build on this new underlying offence where the person was responsible for the creation or alteration of the sexual material transmitted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gap in the Criminal Code currently criminalises the sharing of private sexual material online; however, the definition of 'private sexual material' may not cover artificially generated material. This bill eliminates any doubt that artificially generated material is absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, covered by these changes. Section 473.1, which contains this definition, will be replaced or repealed. The new offence applies where a person transmits material using a carriage service and where the material depicts a person who is or appears to be 18 years of age or older.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite think there is no need for these laws. The Manager of Opposition Business thinks we are 'repealing existing offences and replacing them with offences that appear to do the same thing'. That's a quote. With great respect, what we are doing is moving to a consent model where an essential part of the determination is whether these images were created and shared without consent. We are doing this by introducing new offences in the new section 474, where the key question relates equally to both types of sexual material, both artificial and real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Did the opposition not learn their lesson when it came to social media? Famously, governments around the world, including former coalition governments, took a laissez-faire approach to not regulating giant social media companies. Only now we are paying the price; we're seeing that play out, decades on. Nine years in government and suddenly they have now realised that they didn't do enough to regulate emerging social media companies. This is the realisation of the opposition, all of a sudden. I ask the opposition: why don't you come out and tell us exactly why you didn't do this when you had the chance?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We unequivocally disagree that these amendments to the Criminal Code are not needed. We are mitigating and we must mitigate the unintended harms of AI, and we will do this. We must do this early. We're not going to wait another 10 years. And we're going to do it in a pragmatic way that recognises the productivity benefits of these tools, but approach much more cautiously than the coalition ever did with social media companies when they had the chance. There is a need for regulation, there is a need for a legislative framework to deal with the rapidly expanding technologies we're seeing, like AI.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are behind the eight ball. We need to start taking the necessary legislative and regulatory action to mitigate the worst effects of these technologies. And there are negative effects—clearly—as I have described already with the AI deepfake sexual material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot go down the same path that we did in the past with the social media companies with respect to AI. In many respects, people are arguing that it's already too late for our kids who are addicted to doomscrolling and spend hours and hours on screens, exposed to content that disrupts their mental health and self-esteem, either through social media or through just being online for hours and hours as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a real epidemic within our communities. Parents are waking up to it, clearly. Parents are disturbed by it. There are a lack of legislative or regulatory frameworks to address or mitigate the worst impacts of these technologies. That has to stop. I'm not saying we're going to get it right 100 per cent of the time, but we do need to do this and we need to start the work today. The opposition needs to actually understand that this is in the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we have seen time and time again is when someone is already known to law enforcement authorities and recognised in the justice system and they offend again. That is why this bill introduces two aggravated offences which apply with increased penalties if the offender has had three or more civil penalty orders made against them for contravening the Online Safety Act 2021—'creation or alteration of the sexual material transmitted'. The new offences will have a maximum penalty of six years imprisonment for transmitting sexual material without consent and seven years imprisonment for aggravated offences, including where the person created the material themselves. These amendments are absolutely necessary and absolutely our priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to remind the House—and we're all aware of this, as recent events have shown—that young girls in schools are not psychosocially safe, in many respects. When you have these horrific offences being committed against them, like the sharing of sexual deepfakes or the making of lists which rank young women and sexualise them, there is no safety for these girls. It's these events where a society-wide scourge starts to take hold. As I said earlier, we've made the mistake—the previous government and other governments around the world certainly did—of not regulating the social media giants and the impacts of that technology. We cannot make the same mistake when it comes to the use of AI in this context. The young people who are exposed to and partake in these behaviours today will go on to live in a world where women will be harmed by their intimate partners or raped or killed on our streets. The majority of women who are killed are killed in that way—by people that they know or men that they know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Online abuse, and the element of psychological violence therein, is a part of this cycle of physical violence. It's all interconnected. This is what women are subjected to on a society-wide scale. We've seen the horrible outcomes of this in many examples. In my own electorate, the murder of women and the rape of women has occurred, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Jill Meagher was an infamous case, and there are many, many others. People in my electorate of Wills won't forget that. They won't forget what happened to Jill Meagher while she was walking home in Brunswick in 2012 or, in May 2019, when Courtney Herron, another young woman from our community of Wills, was murdered in Royal Park or, in the same year, when Aiia Maasarwe was murdered in the northern suburbs whilst walking home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These were just young women—who were walking home after going out or going to work or who were on shift—and that is what happened to them. There was also a woman who, again, in the same year, was running along Merri Creek, which borders my electorate—a spot that many of us in my community in Wills have found sanctuary in. She was attacked, sexually assaulted and raped there. We can't forget their stories. We can't forget what happened to them. We can't forget the deep trauma that has impacted their families and their loved ones. They were part of our community. They were part of the fabric of our community. What they went through in their deaths was senseless and needless. I say again: harm is not just the physical harm. There is also that psychosocial harm that comes from the impacts of having that kind of sexually explicit material shared online without consent. Harm is that which young women go through when targeted by these forms of online abuse, and it is a harm that leads them to a deadly and life-threatening cycle that is, as I said, interconnecting all of these behaviours. That is why legislation like this is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young men should be educated, encouraged to be strong allies and work actively towards reducing violence at its source, where it starts. Educate young boys, teach them respect, empower them to understand that there is a positive sense of being male and what that positive masculinity entails, which is not the violent acts, not the anger. Give them another path where they are empowered to be respectful and strong in a very different way. That is what real manhood is about and that is where early education comes in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not only the responsibility of parents, of teachers and of society to teach kids respect but also the responsibility of this place, this House, to pass laws to provide the legislative and regulatory framework that make it unacceptable by law to take such actions. It is also our responsibility to show leadership, to take actions and to lead societal reform in this place. I would hope the opposition would understand the importance of that to the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't hesitate, through these laws, to punish those that violate these expectations, these standards, that we're setting. That is what we do here in this place. The safety of women across Australia starts in our schools, starts at our sports clubs, starts in the conversations we have at the dinner table about respectful relationships. In the worst-case scenarios, when it has to be addressed, it is addressed by these laws that we pass here. The Criminal Code has to be robust, and it has to appropriately criminalise actions. All of this in combination has to be able to break the chain of disrespect towards women that leads to the worst elements of violence down the track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislative change plays an important role in sending a strong message that non-consensual distribution of such horrible images is unacceptable to us as leaders—as political leaders, as community leaders and as citizens—and that applies whether it is AI generated, artificial intelligence, or it is real. This bill starts the first steps towards regulating the worst effects of this technology, because we cannot wait until something else happens to regulate technologically created harms, until it becomes worse, until the scourge is so widespread that we have lost control of it completely. We cannot wait for things to get worse before we change these laws. That is why I call on the opposition to support this bill, to support the necessary changes that we are making to address these issues and to begin that journey together. I commend this bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I rise to support the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024. Every time you read or hear the news, there is another story about artificial intelligence, deepfake abuse and the ongoing debate on how to regulate these rapidly advancing technologies. Encountering many forms of sexual violence online driven by AI generated deepfake technology is deeply unsettling. Women represent 99 per cent of those targeted by deepfake pornography, which makes up 98 per cent of all deepfake videos online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Urgent action is absolutely needed, and effective legislation is a critical starting point. Thousands of women and girls have experienced this form of gender based violence already, and it is exacerbated by the advancing accessibility and the sophistication of technology. In 2023 alone the volume of deepfake abuse videos surpassed the total of all previous years combined, with the number of non-consensual videos doubling annually. Those non-consensual images are created and shared with the goal of humiliating and degrading the women and girls in them. The fallout is immense, and it goes beyond personal harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deepfakes, for those unfamiliar, are digitally manipulated images, videos or audio recordings that use artificial intelligence to create realistic but false depictions of individuals. These creations can depict people doing or saying things they never did—always stunning realism blurring the lines between reality and fiction. The legislation before us aims to address a specific and troubling aspect of this technology: the non-consensual sharing of sexually explicit deepfake material. This bill seeks to criminalise such acts, ensuring that individuals who distribute sexually explicit content without the consent of those depicted face significant legal consequences. This includes deepfakes generated by using AI or other technologies which have increasingly been used to exploit and harm individuals, particularly women and girls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new bill aims to criminalise the sharing of non-consensual deepfake sexually explicit material online. These reforms ensure that individuals who distribute sexually explicit content without the consent of those depicted, including deepfakes created by using AI or other technologies, will face significant criminal penalties. The bill targets individuals who share and create sexualised deepfake images without consent. The application of Commonwealth criminal law to individuals who meet the minimum age of criminal responsibility is not a new concept. It is worth noting that the new offences are specifically targeted at sexual material depicting or appearing to depict individuals over 18 years of age. Existing criminal offences already cover child abuse material, which is comprehensively addressed in a separate division of the Criminal Code. This includes detailed offences and severe penalties for the sharing of child abuse material online, including content generated by artificial intelligence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether you personally know a victim or have simply seen and used their image on the internet will now be irrelevant. The new offences cover instances where an individual shares a sexually explicit deepfake of a real person either knowing the person has not consented or being reckless as to whether they have consented. This applies regardless of who the real person is and whether they are personally known to the offender. Prosecuting offences like this is increasingly complex in the digital age. However, the Australian Federal Police possesses unique capabilities and extensive experience in investigating these types of crimes. The AFP was also consulted in the development of this bill, ensuring that their input and the challenges faced by law enforcement were taken into consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth noting that the Commonwealth power to legislate does not extend to the mere creation of sexually explicit adult deepfakes. The offence applies to the sharing of non-consensual deepfake sexually explicit material. If the person who shares the material also created the deepfake, there is an aggravated offence with a higher penalty of up to seven years imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are existing Commonwealth offences that prohibit menacing or harassing another person online. These could apply, for example, if someone creates an image of their partner and then threatens to post it online without consent. Additionally, state and territory laws largely cover the creation of such deepfakes. This approach is consistent with existing arrangements for the criminalisation of child abuse material. State and territory laws address the creation of child abuse material, while strong Commonwealth offences criminalise the sharing of such material online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing Commonwealth criminal offences do not clearly apply to sexually explicit deepfake material. Some state and territory jurisdictions have legislation to address the non-consensual sharing of intimate images online. This bill will complement state and territory criminal offences and ensure a more consistent national approach. The bill stipulates severe consequences for those found guilty of transmitting such material without consent. Offenders can face up to six years imprisonment, with aggravated cases facing potentially up to seven years behind bars. These penalties are designed to deter and punish this harmful behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure the legislation targets appropriate cases, specific offences have been incorporated. For example: reporting to authorities—passing material to the police to report a crime, or providing it to court to assist in prosecution, is permissible; for medical and professional purposes—doctors can share images to obtain a second opinion from colleagues without falling under the law's purview; for content based photography—images of models taken with explicit consent for advertising or publication purposes are exempt from the legislation; and for satirical use—images used in a satirical context are also considered exempt under these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to know that the legislation is not intended to encompass the sharing of legitimate adult pornography. Rather, its focus is on prohibiting the dissemination of deepfake sexually explicit images where the perpetrator either knows that consent has not been granted or behaves recklessly in determining whether consent was given. This approach aims to address the harmful impacts of non-consensual deepfake material while safeguarding legitimate uses of digital content. Someone may wonder what happens when consent is uncertain. The law addresses this by focusing on cases where individuals knowingly share deepfake sexually explicit images without consent or recklessly disregard whether consent was given. This includes situations where consent is not actively considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a deep and profound impact from non-consensual sharing of digitally altered and sexually explicit material, particularly on women and girls. This behaviour not only causes immediate harm but can also have lasting emotional and psychological effects. It's a form of abuse that degrades, humiliates and dehumanises victims, and which perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes, contributing to gender based violence. Unfortunately, instances where such material is created and shared out of revenge or malice, often referred to as 'revenge porn' or image based abuse, are widespread. These are actions that exploit vulnerabilities and which can severely damage a person's reputation and sense of security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Victims of such abuse often face severe anxiety, depression and trauma. The non-consensual distribution of sexually explicit deepfake material can destroy personal relationships, careers and mental health. The fear of these images surfacing can lead to long-term psychological distress and a pervasive sense of insecurity. Furthermore, this behaviour perpetuates a culture of misogyny and violence against women. By creating and sharing deepfake sexually explicit images, perpetrators are engaging in an act of control and humiliation, reinforcing toxic power dynamics that have long oppressed women. This form of digital violence is an extension of the systemic gender based violence that continues to plague our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, artificial intelligence technology also has the potential to exacerbate election related challenges, including the spread of disinformation and cybervulnerabilities in election systems. The Albanese Labor government is committed to enhancing the transparency and accountability of Australia's electoral system. Actions are being taken by the Minister for Communications and by the Australian Electoral Commission to combat misinformation and disinformation, especially during elections. Additionally, the government has asked the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to consider ways to prevent or limit the influence of inaccurate or false information on electoral outcomes. This includes examining the impact of artificial intelligence, foreign interference, social media, misinformation and disinformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also has work underway to combat online scams and fraud, including establishing the National Anti-Scam Centre to coordinate and share intelligence across law enforcement, private and public sectors. It has taken down over 5,000 investment scam websites through ASIC's scam disruption activities. The government has also committed to introduce legislation in 2024 and to fund the administration and enforcement of mandatory industry codes for banks, telecommunications providers and digital platforms.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As AI technology advances and becomes more accessible, the potential for misuse in creating and distributing such material grows. This necessitates urgent legislative action, like the proposed bill, to establish serious penalties. These measures are crucial for protecting vulnerable individuals from further online harm and ensuring that those who engage in such abusive behaviour face appropriate consequences under the law. Looking ahead, the Albanese Labor government remains committed to safeguarding Australians from online threats including deepfake misuse, conducting ongoing reviews such as the statutory review of the Online Safety Act 2021, seeking to enhance protections and ensuring our online safety laws remain effective in combatting emerging harms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this legislation represents a critical step in protecting individuals from the insidious impact of deepfake technology. By imposing stringent penalties and clarifying exceptions, we aim to uphold dignity, privacy and safety in our digital age. This bill sends a clear message that our society will not tolerate the degradation and abuse of individuals through technological means. We stand against the perpetration of misogyny and violence against women, and we commit to fostering a safer, more respectful digital environment for all.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024. At the beginning of the previous sitting year, I remember the member for Bruce came into this place and delivered a speech that was, in part, the product of artificial intelligence. The member for Bruce, of course, disclosed this fact, for it was indeed part of illustrating the capability and role of artificial intelligence, the rapid pace of its evolution and how it can find its way into activities within our lives which have been occurring even prior to the advent of the digital age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the humble art and science of speechwriting predates the invention of the computer, the typewriter and even paper as we conventionally know it. Now we can utilise generative artificial intelligence to create speeches, a whole raft of other documents, sounds including a person's voice and video including the likeness of a person. Subjects can be blissfully unaware of the production of those last two until the content is disseminated by its creator. The potential applications for these productions can be completely benign, humorous and even satirical, but they can also be malevolent. It is incumbent on governments and parliaments alike to act to deter and punish individuals to ensure that society can reflect on the criminal law keeping pace with technological adjustments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the position we find ourselves in today with the measures contained within this bill. It is one that forms a crucial step in addressing one of the most insidious forms of abuse that has emerged in our digital age: the non-consensual creation and distribution of deepfake, sexually explicit material. Deepfakes generated through advanced artificial intelligence can create disturbingly realistic but entirely false depictions of individuals in compromising and degrading situations. This legislation aims to protect individuals, particularly women and girls, from the profound harm caused by these digital fabrications. Deepfakes are manipulated images, videos or audio recordings that depict individuals in situations they never actually experienced. The technology behind deepfakes has advanced rapidly, making it increasingly accessible and easy to use. This has led to a surge in the creation of deepfake content, much of which is sexually explicit and intended to humiliate, degrade and harm the victims. As noted by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, we are facing a potential tsunami of AI-generated abuse material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of these deepfakes on victims is profound. They suffer from severe emotional distress, reputational damage and, in some cases, financial harm. The victims are often young women who find their likeness manipulated into explicit content that is then shared widely on the internet. This not only violates their privacy but also perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and contributes to a culture of gender based violence. The emotional and physical toll on these victims cannot be overstated. Many suffer from anxiety, depression and a profound sense of violation. This is a form of abuse that leaves deep and lasting scars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill introduces new offences to specifically target the non-consensual sharing of deepfake sexually explicit material. The key provisions of the bill include the creation of a new offence for transmitting sexually explicit material using a carriage service where the person depicted is an adult and has not consented to the transmission. This offence carries a maximum penalty of six years imprisonment. The use of a carriage service has evolved with its meaning over the course of time, but such is the nature of the law adapting to reflect technological change and capture future developments within its auspices. The bill also introduces aggravated offences with a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. These apply where the perpetrator was responsible for creating or altering the material or where they have a history of civil penalty orders under the Online Safety Act. These offences will cover both real material, such as unaltered images and recordings, and fake material, created or altered using technology, like deepfakes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Existing laws have not kept pace with the rapid advancements in technology that enable the creation of deepfakes. The current definition of private sexual material does not explicitly extend to artificially generated content, leaving a significant gap in our legal framework. This bill addresses the gap, ensuring that those who exploit technology to create and disseminate harmful material are held accountable. The introduction of these new offences is a clear signal that the law must evolve to meet the challenges posed by new technology. Moreover, this legislation is a response to the growing public outcry against the misuse of deepfake technologies. Victims, community groups, and advocacy organisations have called for stronger protections against this form of abuse. The Albanese government's commitment to introducing these reforms reflects our dedication to safeguarding the dignity and rights of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for such legislation is underscored by the numerous reports of deepfake pornography circulating online, often targeting young women and causing significant distress, even leading to self-harm and suicide. There have been numerous instances where individuals, particularly young women, have been targeted with deepfake pornography. For example, recent reports highlighted a case where students at a school were subjected to fake nude images circulated online. These incidents underscore the urgent need for robust legal protections. In another case, a female teacher found herself the victim of a deepfake attack, with manipulated images circulating amongst students and colleagues. These examples illustrate the profound harm that can result from the misuse of deepfake technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, have provided critical input in shaping these reforms. Additionally, legal experts and victims-survivors have emphasised the importance of creating a legal deterrent against the creation and dissemination of deepfake pornography. The involvement of these stakeholders ensures that the bill is both comprehensive and effective in addressing the issue. This bill is part of a broader suite of measures aimed at tackling online harms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has been proactive in addressing various forms of digital abuse, particularly those targeting women and girls. These measures include increasing funding for the eSafety Commissioner, advancing the review of the Online Safety Act and committing to address harmful practices such as doxxing. These efforts demonstrate the Albanese Labor government's commitment to creating a safer online environment for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rapid growth of deepfake technology has created new challenges for law enforcement and policymakers. While artificial intelligence can have many positive applications, its misuse to create deepfake pornography represents a significant threat to individuals' privacy and dignity. This legislation ensures that our laws keep pace with technological advancements and provide robust protections against digital abuse. By criminalising the non-consensual sharing of deepfake sexually explicit material, we are taking a decisive step to protect individuals from digital abuse and to uphold their dignity and their privacy. The new offences introduced by this bill are designed to be both comprehensive and proportionate. They target the non-consensual sharing of both real and artificially generated sexually explicit material, ensuring that perpetrators can't evade responsibility by exporting gaps in the existing law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes specific defences to ensure the offences are targeted and do not overly criminalise legitimate activities. For example, the transmission of material necessary for law enforcement, court proceedings or genuine medical or scientific purposes is exempted from the purpose of this legislation. These defences are consistent with the existing exemptions in the Online Safety Act and ensure that the new offences are applied fairly and justly. It is important to note that this legislation does not intend to interfere with private communications between consenting adults. The government has no interest in regulating the private activities of adults who engage in consensual behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus of this bill is solely on the consensual creation and distribution of sexually explicit material. This distinction is crucial to ensure that the legislation is both effective and proportionate. By targeting the harmful and non-consensual use of deepfake technology, we are upholding the rights and dignity of individuals while respecting personal freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is in the transmission or the creation of such material, the knowledge that the subject has consented to being a part of it should remain vitally important as to whether it can be deemed to be lawful or otherwise. Reckless indifference as to whether someone has provided consent to be involved in any sexual activity—whether it involves them or their digital likeness and whether it is within cyberspace or outside of it—should always have a presumption of being unlawful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also addresses the issue of aggravated offences, which carry higher penalties for more serious conduct. These aggravated offences apply in cases where the perpetrator has previously been subject to civil penalty orders or similar conduct under the Online Safety Act and where they were directly involved in creating or altering material. By introducing these aggravated offences, the legislation provides a stronger deterrent against repeat offenders and those who engage in particularly egregious conduct. The inclusion of these higher penalties reflects the serious nature of the offences and the profound harm they cause to victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this legislation follows extensive consultation with key stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, legal experts and victim advocacy groups. This collaborative approach has ensured that the bill is both comprehensive and effective in addressing the issue of deepfake pornography. The feedback from these consultations has been invaluable in shaping the final provisions of the bill and ensuring that it meets the needs of victims and the broader community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This process has also highlighted the widespread support for these measures and the urgent need for action. The importance of this legislation cannot be overstated. It sends a clear message that the non-consensual creation and distribution of sexually explicit material is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. It provides a robust legal framework to hold perpetrators accountable and protect victims from digital abuse. This is not just a legal issue but a moral imperative. As a society we must stand against the misuse of technology to harm and exploit individuals. This legislation is a critical step in that direction, and I am proud to support it. By working together, we can create a safer and more respectful online environment for everyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of deepfake technology and its misuse is not confined to Australia. It is a global problem that requires international cooperation and collaboration. We must work with other nations to develop and enforce standards that protect individuals from the harmful use of deepfake technology. By leading the way with this legislation, Australia can set an example for other countries to follow. This global approach is essential to effectively combat the spread of deepfake pornography and to protect individuals worldwide. Additionally, legal experts and victims-survivors have emphasised the importance of creating a legal deterrent against the creation and dissemination of deepfake pornography. The involvement of these stakeholders ensures that the bill is both comprehensive and effective in addressing the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, it is essential to continuously evaluate and adapt our legal frameworks as technology evolves. Though we must continue to develop innovative legal solutions to address the dynamic challenges posed by emerging technologies, we must explore avenues to enhance digital literacy, strengthen cybersecurity measures and promote responsible AI development as it continues to evolve and improve its ability to learn and execute even more complex commands and functions. We need to ensure they follow society's expectations. Ensuring the creators and the end users of this technology are not just ethical but that they uphold community values and expectations is important, given that artificial intelligence itself isn't ethical or moral of its own accord. This bill lays a foundation for future efforts to combat digital abuse through collaborative efforts between government, industry and civil society. We can create a digital environment that prioritises safety, privacy and dignity for all Australians, whether they're public figures or just someone who, as all of us should, have an expectation that if anyone were to create and transmit sexually explicit deepfake-generated content without their consent then such conduct would be defined explicitly as criminal behaviour. Perpetrators of this conduct must know not just that what they're doing is unethical or morally reprehensible but also that it's illegal—and that this criminal behaviour is of such a nature that it deserves to be condemned both by the government of Australia and the people Australia insofar that, when prosecuted, their actions are punished. That punishment should also provide a strong deterrent not just for themselves but for others out there who might attempt to do the same to someone else in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want mums and dads—fathers and mothers—and brothers and sisters to know that we have an obligation to educate our young people in society and to ensure that we uphold the values we all expect. This type of behaviour needs to stop. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  I also rise in support of the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024. This important bill will ban the non-consensual sharing of deepfake sexually explicit material, something which is a serious and growing concern which is already, very sadly, impacting Australians who have fallen victim to this new technological abuse. Digitally created and altered sexually explicit material is a vile and damaging form of abuse that can inflict deep harm on victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people, in particular, are at risk of image based abuse. The internet has changed dramatically in recent years, with new social media apps constantly popping up—changing platforms that are, increasingly, showing children and young adults damaging content. Further, the rise of artificial intelligence, while potentially an incredibly useful tool in work or study, increasingly has the potential to be harmful. The children of today are digital natives; they have never lived in a world where the internet and social media don't exist. Older generations learned new technologies as we moved into the workforce and engaged with many of these new apps. However, this was without having the innate knowledge as a result of being on the internet from as young as being a toddler, as Gen Z were. They inherently understand and use social media. I see this with my own very young children and the way in which they adapted very quickly, and from a very young age, to these sorts of technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the onset of new social media and the wide range of AI platforms now available, new ways of subjecting women and girls, particularly, to assault and harassment have, disgustingly, infiltrated society. We must act now to ensure that we can end violence against women and girls within one generation, as our government has committed to. Specifically, this bill amends the Criminal Code to modernise and strengthen offences targeted to non-consensual sharing of sexually explicit material online, including material that has been digitally created or altered. This bill also includes aggravated offences, which build on the underlying offence, for people who have created or altered the material that has been transmitted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms in this bill make clear that those who share sexually explicit material without consent by using technology like artificial intelligence will be subject to serious criminal penalties. The new offences will have a maximum penalty of six years imprisonment for transmitting sexual material without consent, and seven years imprisonment for aggravated offences, including where the person created the material. These amendments are high-priority reforms following the government's public commitment on 1 May this year to introduce a suite of measures to tackle online harms, particularly those targeting women and young girls. These new offences will place a high burden on anyone who thinks to perpetuate this kind of abuse. It is another step that the Albanese government is taking to protect women and girls from horrific online attacks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sexually explicit deepfakes which are created and shared without consent are used to degrade and dehumanise victims. They are primarily targeted at women and can perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and drive gender based violence. When they are shared with others or posted online without the consent of the person depicted, it is a serious breach of a person's privacy and can have lasting physically and psychologically harmful impacts on victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The phenomenon of image-based violence and abuse is not new. Currently the Criminal Code criminalises the sharing of private sexual material online. There has also been a decades-long discussion about the sharing of private sexual material, often called revenge porn. Revenge porn has been criminalised in every state and territory and the Commonwealth, with the exception of Tasmania. This has ensured that people who are victims of that form of image based abuse can receive restitution for the harm that experience and that perpetrators can be charged. However, the current definition of 'private sexual material' does not adequately cover deepfake images or other artificially generated material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes to repeal the existing offence relating to private sexual material and replace it with a new offence that applies in the following circumstances: where a person transmits material using a carriage service, where the material depicts a person who is or appears to be 18 years of age or older, where the material depicts or appears to depict a person engaging in a sexual pose or sexual activity, or particular parts of their body, and where the person knows that the person depicted does not consent to the transmission of the material or they are reckless as to whether the other person consents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces two aggravated offences which apply increased penalties to the offence where, before the commission of the underlying offence, three or more civil penalty orders were made against the person for contraventions of relevant provisions of the Online Safety Act 2021 and the person was responsible for the creation or alteration of the sexual material transmitted. These amendments are essential to ensure that our laws can apply to both real material, such as unaltered images and recordings, and fake or doctored material that has been created or altered using AI or other technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill sets out specific defences to the transmission of the sexual material without consent to ensure the offence is targeted and proportionate. The new offences will not cover private communications between consenting adults or interfere with private sexual relationships. It's about sharing with other people or more broadly. They will also only apply to material depicting or appearing to depict adults. The Criminal Code continues to criminalise the use of carriage services for child abuse material, including child abuse material generated by artificial intelligence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that is aiming to end gender based violence in a generation. Our government's work is guided by the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. The plan sets out how all parts of society, including governments, businesses, workplaces, the media, schools and educational institutions, the family, the domestic and sexual violence sector, communities and all individuals must work together to achieve this shared vision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent budget, our government permanently established the Leaving Violence Program so those escaping violence can receive financial support, safety assessments and referrals to support pathways. The Leaving Violence Program supports victims-survivors of intimate partner violence to make informed choices about leaving violent relationships and ensures they are receiving the vital support they need. Our government has also funded a pilot of age-assurance technology to protect children from harmful content like pornography and other age-restricted online services. The new pilot is part of a suite of interventions aimed at curbing easy access to age-inappropriate material by children and young people and tackling extreme misogyny online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is such an important part of the prevention of gender based violence. That's why our government is funding a new phase of the Stop it at the Start campaign. This new phase will specifically include a counter-influencing campaign in online spaces where violent and misogynistic content thrives to directly challenge the material in the spaces where it's being viewed. The campaign is intended to counter the corrosive influence of online content targeted at young adults that condones violence against women. It will raise awareness about a proliferation of misogynistic influencers and content and encourage conversations within families about the damaging impact of the material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disturbing reports we heard out of Victoria last month, where over 50 girls were subjected to sexually explicit deepfake photos of them spread around their school, indicates how important it is for our government to act now. Criminalising deepfake sexually explicit images is the next step that we can take to ensure that vulnerable people are protected online. Sexually explicit deepfake images can affect everyone, from major celebrities to school students. For each person subjected to image abuse online, it is a harrowing and life-altering experience. As technology develops at a never seen before rate, our laws must protect vulnerable people from new forms of abuse. No-one should ever be subjected to any form of abuse, and this bill is how our government is working to ensure that future generations are kept safe online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say, as a mother of young children, just how important this is and how concerning. I suppose that as part of an older generation—as my staff, who drafted this, have described me, and I guess that's so—I was not exposed from such a vulnerable and young age. We didn't live through that in the way that our children's generation are. The idea that young girls could have these faked images spread around their school—just think about the impact that that will have on those girls for rest of their lives. That is why this bill is so incredibly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, our government is wanting to end gender based violence in a generation, and the online abuse is a really important part of that. This deepfake AI generated or altered pornography is something that we first saw affecting celebrities, but now it's affecting children in our schools. I am very proud that our government is taking this action now, taking this seriously and putting an end to it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  The Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024 is a timely piece of legislation. The Albanese government will create a new criminal set of offences to ban the non-consensual sharing of deepfake pornography. Digitally created and altered sexually explicit material is a damaging form of abuse against women and girls that can inflict deep harm on victims. I say women and girls because overwhelmingly this material is created and used against women and girls, although some boys are also the victims of it. In fact, some of the apps that create this deepfake material won't work on male bodies; they only work on female bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will make clear that those who share sexually explicit material without consent using technology like artificial intelligence will be subject to serious criminal penalties, as they should be. This includes material that's been created or altered using technology such as deepfakes. Sexually explicit deepfakes, created and shared without consent, are used deliberately to dehumanise and degrade others. They particularly target women and girls, and they can certainly perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and drive gender based violence. When they are shared with others or posted online without the consent of the person depicted, it is a serious breach of that person's privacy, and it can have long-lasting harmful impacts on the subject. So I welcome this legislation. It's the work of a government that is looking at the issues that our society faces and addressing them in a swift and thorough way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is designed to stem the flow of the particular harms that result from deepfake pornography, and it's very important that we act now. The world's changing, and the technology that's available to online actors is changing. We're in a very particular moment of history, before what I think will be a really massive change as AI becomes even more dominant and mainstream. The shift that we're talking about, with the massive upswing in the use of AI, is as profound as the shift that we saw in 2007 when the iPhone was introduced. But only now is the alarm beginning to be raised, in the last couple of years, about the huge impact that social media is having on our health, on our attention spans and, in particular, on the mental health of our children. The lag between the introduction of the iPhone, the widespread use of social media and the way that this government is beginning to address those harms shows how quickly our society can change—and not for the better—and how important it is that we tackle these problems now. We can't allow the new and additional problem of AI generated deepfake pornography to escape from us in the way that some of the worst elements of social media escaped from us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to modernise and strengthen offences targeting the non-consensual sharing of sexually explicit material online. The new offences will have a maximum penalty of six years imprisonment for transmitting sexually explicit material without consent and seven years imprisonment for aggravated offences, including where the person created the material. These amendments are a high priority following the government's public commitments on 1 May 2024 to introduce a suite of measures to tackle online harms, particularly harms that target women and young girls, who are overwhelmingly the victims here. This is timely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said a moment ago, we're at a moment in history where AI is about to massively take off in its influence in all elements of our lives, and I do think that, as a community, we are not even beginning to grapple with what some of those effects might be. We're perhaps just beginning to understand what the future looks like. We really do need to think about how we get the best out of artificial intelligence, how we use it for public good and human benefit. We need to give some thought to that now in these early stages in a way that we really didn't give consideration to the massive upswing in the use of social media a few years back. We allowed open slather in social media and we're constantly chasing the harmful impacts of that now, trying to, in some ways, put the genie back in the bottle.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For deepfake porn apps, essentially what you do is you feed a photo of a real person into the app, and it spits out a faked sexually explicit pornographic but ultra-realistic image of that person. In fact, one Spanish mother that was interviewed on this said, if she hadn't known the details of her daughter's body, she would have assumed that the image that was circulating in her small town of her 14-year-old daughter was a real image.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Time to Reboot: Feminism in the Algorithm Age</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> Canberra writer Carla Wilshire calls this an 'epidemic of non-consent'. The apps and fake images are being used very deliberately to bully, to harass and to cause immense distress to the, largely, young girls who are being pornified by their classmates—young girls, fellow students and sometimes teachers and other women that they come into contact with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents who were interviewed by News Corp papers in May told horror stories about their children even taking their own lives after being bullied and threatened with these sorts of deepfake images. There are so many horror stories, including that of Tilly Rosewarne from Bathurst, who was bullied from grade 5 onwards but found that the bullying escalated beyond endurance when one kid faked a pornographic picture of her and put it on Snapchat. Tilly suicided. Bullying follows children home from school. They cannot escape because of the influence of social media in their lives, the fact that their phones are always in their pockets, and it becomes a million times more toxic and more powerful when you combine it with the technology that allows this sort of deepfake pornography. So we are acting with this legislation to ban the creation and non-consensual distribution of deepfake pornography. These reforms will make it clear that those who seek to abuse or degrade people through doxing or deepfakes or abusing their privacy online will be subject to serious criminal penalties because what is happening to people online is having a real-world impact in our homes, in our schools, in our workplaces, in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the most recent budget we funded a rapid review of research into perpetrators that we expect will also look at the way perpetrators of violence are using social media and technology to continue their harassment and intimidation. Researchers in the area of domestic violence and sexual violence, Jess Hill and Michael Salter, are very explicit, too, about the connection between pornography and rising rates of violence against women. Professor Salter said last month, 'The technology sector is profiting from services and products that cause mass social harm, including violence against women and children.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent research shows that pornography related searches and downloads range between 10 and 20 per cent of overall internet traffic. While research on the algorithms that porn sites use is just beginning, what is very clear from the studies is that people are being shown and recommended new and more extreme forms of pornography compared to what they searched for or have even expressed an interest in. A 2024 study from Dublin City University shows that the recommender algorithms used by social media platforms are rapidly amplifying misogynistic and male supremacist content. The study tracked and recorded information to 10 neutral accounts on 10 blank smart phones, five on YouTube shorts and five on TikTok. The researchers found that all of the accounts that were identified as male accounts were fed masculinist, antifeminist and other extremist content irrespective of whether they sought out general or male supremacist related content, and they all received this content—this is the bit that really blows me away—within the first 23 minutes of the experiment. That is what the algorithm is feeding people whether they want it or not. And there are plenty of young men who will say to you, 'I believe in equality between men and women, girls and boys. I don't search out the stuff. They know I'm a bloke, possibly, because I'm looking up car videos, and the stuff that gets fed to me is violent, it is degrading, it is graphic and it is harmful.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Released today was a study that outlined the link between social media use, pornography and choking, which has become very common in the sexual relations of teenagers and young adults. Choking is a sexual activity that is significantly on the rise. There is no question in my mind that it's on the rise because it's being depicted in pornographic videos that are being fed to young people in their social media accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Researchers from the University of Melbourne and the University of Queensland raised the alarm about the harms done—again, mostly to women and girls—by the increasing adoption of this practice. Harms include, obviously, losing consciousness. Of course, every time you lose consciousness, you're damaging your brain, in the same way as you would if you were a footballer getting a knock to the head that knocked you unconscious. Obviously, it can lead to death in extreme cases—after minutes, mind you, it can lead to death. But harms also include the risk of strokes. In fact, sexual choking is the leading cause of strokes for women under the age of 40, according to this research. Most people engaged in these practices are not aware of the risks involved. I have to say: this is a really good example of where you need very explicit sex education for young people and you need very explicit consent education, because I don't believe you can consent to a practice unless you know that there is potential for brain damage, stroke or death from that practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the Attorney-General for this very important legislation. It is one of the ways we are seeking to address the increasingly hostile and dangerous online world that exists for our children. I think the increasingly hostile and dangerous online world, instead of helping us build a better, more equal, fairer society, in many respects is taking us backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by saying to the eSafety Commissioner how important her work is and how much, as a government, we value the effort that she and her team are putting into creating a safer online world for our children. We cannot allow the progress that we've made, over decades, towards gender equality, or allow the progress that we want to make towards safety for women and girls from gender based violence, to be undermined by the tech bros and cowboys who think the rules don't apply to them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024. One of the biggest changes in our world over the past couple of years has been the rise and rise of artificial intelligence technology. Every second day now there is another news story involving AI. It is being used in all sorts of ways, mostly for good, to help people learn new things and for businesses to increase their productivity. It is generally being used to make the world a better place. But, as is sadly common with new, powerful technologies, AI is also being misused for bad reasons. One of the most highly disturbing examples of this is the use of AI to create non-consensual deepfake sexual material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A deepfake is a fake image, video or voice clip depicting a real person. Deepfakes are created by using AI to manipulate real data associated with the depicted person, which could be photos or videos of them from social media. Deepfake content can be highly convincing and hard to distinguish from real photos or videos of a targeted person. This is especially true as AI tools become more advanced and as people upload more and more content of themselves online as well. The more data that is out there and available for a given person, the more realistic deepfakes of them can become.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most deepfake content isn't sexual, and sometimes deepfake technology could be useful. I suspect many singers around the world would probably not have a career without autotune. Deepfakes can also be funny when they are created in good faith and clearly meant to be a fake, such as when a constituent in my electorate sent a deepfake image of me as a kind of Transformer merged with a helicopter. That was a nice surprise, but unfortunately, alongside the harmless deepfakes, a serious issue has been brewing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deepfakes can be very dangerous. The danger of a deepfake lies in the fact that they can depict people doing or saying things that they did not actually do or say. When sexually explicit deepfakes are created of a person without their consent, this is a highly distressing experience for the person depicted and extremely harmful to them and their loved ones. It is a damaging form of abuse and it must stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fake and manipulated content has been a feature of our society for many decades. Famously, in magazines and newspapers, photoshopping has been used to make all kinds of alterations to the way people look—be that slimming them down, whitening their teeth or removing their wrinkles. But deepfakes are opening the door to a whole different league of manipulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the quality of output and how realistic it is and how easy it is to generate, AI powered deepfakes are making photoshop look like ancient technology. Soon it will be possible that an everyday person will be able to generate huge amounts of almost any content they like of very high quality at the click of a button. It is deeply disturbing that some people in our community will use this technology to degrade and dehumanise others by generating non-consensual sexual material based on their likeness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, deepfake technology is already being used in this way. When deepfake sexual material is shared or posted online without the consent of the person depicted, it is a serious breach of the person's privacy and their sense of security. The effects can be long lasting. Once images are out there, victims may have to live with the fear that the reputational damage they're experiencing will follow them throughout their life. The harm also extends to the friends and family of the victim, who share their distress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we have heard shocking news stories about non-consensual deepfake sexual material. Some of these stories involve material being distributed at schools and at workplaces. The stories involving school students are particularly disturbing. Other existing laws already appropriately penalise the use of AI technology to generate sexual material depicting children. This bill applies to deepfake depictions of adults. As young people are early adapters of AI technology, it is crucial that we clearly set out expectations in law. This bill ensures that it will be illegal to generate non-consensual sexual material of any person regardless of their age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the new risks that AI technology is opening up and the harms that are already being brought upon victims of deepfake sexual material, it is crucial that we, as a government, match powerful advancements in technology with advancements in the law, and that is what this bill seeks to do. It addresses an important area of risk and harm that the rise of AI has opened up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Criminal Code to ban the sharing of deepfake sexually explicit material of a person without their consent. This offence will carry a serious criminal penalty, a maximum of six years in prison. If an offender is also responsible for the creation of the non-consensual sexually explicit material, the offence will be considered aggravated, which increases the maximum penalty to seven years imprisonment. The law as it already stands criminalises non-consensual sharing of private sexual material; however, this bill amends the law to ensure that it equally penalises deepfake sexual material of a person too. These important reforms make clear that those who share and create sexually explicit material without consent, including by using new technology like AI, will be subjected to serious criminal penalties—and so they should be. What makes this bill especially needed and important is that we also know that in the vast majority of cases the victims of deepfake sexual material are women and girls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is deeply concerned about the level of gendered violence in this country. In May, the Prime Minister met with state leaders from across Australia to address how the gendered violence crisis in our nation could be best addressed. After that meeting, the government announced almost $1 billion of funding towards the Leaving Violence Program, which will provide those escaping violence with financial support, safety assessments and referrals to support pathways. We also announced a trial of age verification technology to limit the ability of children to access sexually harmful content online. Non-consensual deepfake sexual material perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and drives gender based violence. That's why our next step to address the gendered violence crisis is to crack down on harmful deepfakes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on other initiatives of this government that work towards ending gendered violence in this country. We made a commitment to tackling online harms, particularly online harms that affect women and young girls, and this bill is part of our effort to honour that commitment fully. The bill was developed in consultation with the Australian Federal Police, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and other relevant Commonwealth agencies. It will work hand in hand with relevant state based laws to empower law enforcement and prosecutors to properly go after the people who are doing this abuse, who create and share non-consensual deepfake sexual material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard the calls of victims and members of the public who have felt strongly that the law must be strengthened to address non-consensual deepfake sexual material. We are listening and we are also acting. I support this bill because it penalises the sharing of non-consensual deepfake sexual material. It will reduce this terrible kind of abuse, and I support this bill because it helps our continuing fight against gendered violence in our country. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  Digitally created and altered sexually explicit material that's shared without consent is a damaging and deeply distressing form of abuse. This insidious behaviour is degrading, humiliating and dehumanising for victims. Such acts are overwhelmingly targeted at women and girls and perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and gender based violence. The Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024 delivers on a commitment made by the Albanese government following the National Cabinet held in May to address gender based violence. This commitment recognises the urgent and collective need to respond to the growing challenges associated with artificially generated sexual material. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will strengthen the criminal law to protect vulnerable people from online harm and abuse and hold perpetrators to account. It will create a new criminal offence that applies where a person transmits sexual material depicting an adult person, using a carriage service and the person knows the person depicted does not consent to the transmission of the material or is reckless as to whether or not the other person consents. The new offence will carry a maximum penalty of six years imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces two new aggravated offences. The first aggravated offence applies where the person transmitting the material is also responsible for creating or altering the material. The second aggravated offence applies where a person has already been found liable for similar conduct as the civil standard under the Online Safety Act 2021 on three occasions. These aggravated offences carry a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment to reflect the seriousness of this offending. The bill sets out specific defences to ensure these offences are targeted and proportionate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me address some matters that have been raised in debate. The bill ensures criminal offences relating to non-consensual sharing of sexual material apply to both real and fake material, including deepfakes. The bill repeals previous offences in the Criminal Code dealing with non-consensual sharing of private sexual material. Those existing offences do not adequately cover the situation where deepfake sexual material is shared online without consent. This was the clear advice of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement in December 2023. The new criminal offences remedy this defect and create a strong framework to criminalise the non-consensual sharing of sexual material online. The new criminal offences are based on a consent model to better cover both artificial and real sexual material. Consent is not defined in the legislation and relies on its ordinary meaning, which is understood to be free and voluntary agreement. A person is taken to have consented if the person freely and voluntarily agrees to the sharing of the material. It would not apply where consent was obtained through fear, force or deception.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new offences will apply to sexual material depicting adults, with child abuse material continuing to be dealt with comprehensively in a separate division of the Criminal Code which includes detailed offences and heavy penalties. The new offences do not change the meaning of recklessness. Rather, they clarify that being reckless as to whether a person has consented includes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… not giving any thought to whether or not the person is consenting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's consenting to the transmission. This is consistent with other offences in the Criminal Code which deal with non-consensual sexual activity—for example, the war crime of rape and sexual violence crimes. The spurious arguments raised by the opposition, particularly by the member for Bradfield, to the effect that these new criminal offences are not needed should be firmly rejected. The opposition should instead support stronger laws to counter deepfake sexually explicit material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will hold perpetrators to account for causing harm through the non-consensual sharing of deepfakes and ensure that Australia's criminal offences keep pace with new technology. The Albanese government is committed to keeping Australians safe from technology facilitated abuse.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299623" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  As I was saying previously, in addition, in 2023 over 270 acres that were bulldozed in the Banana shire for beef pasture had been mapped as habitat for 45 EPBC listed species, including the koala, the northern quoll, the spotted-tail quoll and the greater glider. These areas of critical habitat were able to be cleared because of the continuous land-use exemption in the current EPBC Act. This bushland was able to be cleared without any assessment under our national environment laws. In the midst of an environmental and climate crisis, in a country which leads the world for both its mammal extinctions and deforestation rate, it is extraordinary that this can still be happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An assessment of a project's climate change impacts must also be integrated into the EPA's functions through the establishment of a climate trigger. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia state of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment 2021</span> report clearly made the point that climate change is supercharging the destruction of our environment and our nature. As I said earlier, already 19 ecosystems across Australia are on the brink of collapse, and, as UN experts warn, greenhouse gas pollution is the largest and most pervasive threat to the natural environment the world has ever known. Environmental destruction, extinctions and climate change are inextricably linked. Any EPA must have a duty to consider and assess projects for their carbon and their methane emissions. Otherwise it will be doing a vastly incomplete and insufficient job, and this will mean we will continue to see widescale destruction of our environment and our species' extinctions. It is illogical in 2024, having already hit 1.5 degrees of global warming, to create Australia's first Environment Protection Agency with no mandate to protect against further climate change impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes us back full circle to the problem of establishing this EPA as part of the so-called 'stage 2' and delaying stage 3 until who knows when. This EPA, once created, will only be tasked with enforcing what the environment minister herself described as fundamentally broken nature laws, laws which, for the past 25 years, have failed to protect our nature. As the Climate Council pointed out, more than 7.7 million hectares of threatened species' habitat have been cleared since the EPBC Act came into effect in 1999. There are now 1,918 species under threat, with more than half of those at risk of extinction. More than 740 fossil fuel projects have been waved through under the current act, despite their direct role in fuelling harmful climate change. With the great uncertainty about when or if the stage 3 reforms will ever see the light of day, it is critically important that simple steps, such as repealing the RFA exemptions and implementing a climate trigger, be enacted now, in this stage of the reforms of the EPBC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia absolutely needs a national Environment Protection Agency—there is no doubt about it—and I thank and commend the government for their work to establish this body. But it could be so much better and stronger. If ever there were a time for strong and visionary leadership, it is now, and so I urge the minister and the government to act decisively to enact a strong and independent board to oversee the duties of the EPA. This is what environmental organisations across the country are calling for, loud and clear, as a critical step towards the true protection of our nature. I would also strongly urge the minister to include a climate trigger in the EPBC Act in this stage of the reforms and repeal the Regional Forestry Agreement exemptions in this stage of the bills because, if the intention is to truly protect nature, then it simply does not make sense to not do so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I too rise to speak on these really important bills, the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024, the Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill 2024 and the Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. The fact is that the Labor Party is committed to a nature-positive Australia. It is something we believe in very much. We believe in it because our livelihoods, our economy and indeed all our wellbeing depend on the health of our natural world. We all want a country in which nature is being repaired and is regenerating rather than continuing to decline. We have to address that, and we're doing that. We also want to ensure compliance with environmental laws. I would like to commend the Minister for the Environment and Water for the work that has been done on these bills and across a range of different projects since we have been in government. We are a very proactive government when it comes to protecting our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government went to the election promising a strong national independent Environment Protection Agency to be a tough cop on beat and we are delivering upon that. This all comes after a wasted decade under the Liberals and Nationals but, in contrast, Labor is getting on with the job of what needs to be done for environmental repair, and we are delivering more than ever on programs, projects, policies and actions to create a Nature Positive Australia. In fact, no government has done more for the environment or acted on climate change more than the Albanese Labor government. We are absolutely committed to acting on climate change and we have shown that through our very decisive actions in our transition to renewables and through the vast amount of projects and investment that we have made in that area. Labor wants to see our precious natural landscapes repaired instead of the continuing decline we have seen under those opposite in a wasted decade of environmental vandalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we turn to these bills, what they will deliver is stronger environmental powers, faster environmental approvals, and more environment information and transparency. In essence, the key changes in this bill will be Australia's first national independent environmental protection agency with strong new powers and penalties to better protect nature, more accountability and transparency with a new body called Environment Information Australia, which will give businesses easy access to the latest environmental data—release the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report every two years—and report progress on national environmental goals. We will continue working to fully deliver the third stage of environmental law reform. We will do this through constant consultation, working closely with environmental groups, businesses, states and territories, and others, on further updates when it comes to environmental laws, as outlined in our Nature Positive Plan. So it is very clear, the depth of our commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament now has an opportunity. The choices before the parliament are very clear: do you want an independent environmental protection agency or not? We do. We know it is important. Do you want better data to inform environmental decisions? Labor believes we do. Do you want tougher penalties for those breaking environmental laws? We do. Labor want to see that. A really important question for this House to look at is: do you want Australia to be the first jurisdiction in the world to enshrine a definition of 'nature positive' in legislation or not? Labor do, which is why we have these bills here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our new EPA, Environment Protection Australia, along with Environment Information Australia, will ensure compliance with environmental laws and will improve so many processes. It will integrate environmental data collection so there is consistent reliable information on the state of the environment across the country to inform decision-making and to track our progress against our goals, like protecting 30 per cent of our land and oceans by 2030. I think there is consistent agreement that the current regulatory system doesn't work. We know that it isn't working at all. So under Labor we are fixing our laws and we will make sure they improve nature, protect our unique native animals and plants, and prevent extinctions. That is what Australians expect of us, it is what they voted for and it is what we are delivering on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year we passed legislation to establish the world's first nature repair market. We also increased the reach of our environmental laws so the minister for the environment must assess all unconventional gas projects, including shale gas, which trigger our environmental laws. We are moving quickly to establish the Environment Protection Agency and Environment Information Australia. They are crucial elements of our plans to create a Nature Positive Australia and we want to get them in place as soon as possible so they can begin their really important work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, the EPA is an important part of delivering the government's Nature Positive Plan. In passing this legislation, we can get on with the actual work of setting up the new EPA before it is asked to administer new environmental laws so it is a smoother transition of responsibilities from the department to the agency. We're doing all this to better protect nature. We will have a truly national environmental regulator that we can all be incredibly proud of that will be responsible for a wide range of activities under Australia's environmental laws, including in relation to recycling and waste exports, hazardous waste, wildlife trade, sea dumping, ozone protection, underwater cultural heritage and air quality. And we are investing in our people, our planning and our systems to speed up development decisions, essentially to deliver quicker yeses and—when necessary—quicker noes by having that much faster system in place. The fact is the EPA will be the tough cop on the beat, enforcing our laws through new monitoring, compliance and—really important—enforcement powers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we did have the Samuel review, and we know that that found that the regulator was not fulfilling its necessary function in terms of the monitoring of our environmental laws. Professor Samuel also found that serious enforcement actions are rarely used and that penalties need to be much stronger. Again, it showed us that the current system is just not working. Our bills respond to those findings of the Samuel review. As I said, stage 3 will continue our broader efforts to halt and reverse environmental decline and, of course, to protect nature. That is our objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills also set up the Head of Environment Information Australia, an independent position with a legislative mandate to provide environmental data and information to the EPA. It's so important to have this independent position to transparently report on different changes in the environment. Both of these are major initiatives that we do absolutely need to see in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've outlined already, the Albanese government is doing more than ever to protect our environment and act on climate change. We know how important it is to have a whole range of programs, policies, actions and reforms all in place to do that. We do that because we are a party that's committed to preserving the environment. We believe in climate change, and we act responsibly. That is the essence of all that we do when it comes to protecting our environment. This is an issue that I know many people in my area, northern New South Wales, feel strongly about, as well as people right throughout the country. It is one that we have consistently raised here and, indeed, at many elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't deny the science, as those opposite often do, or stand in the way of sensible progress, like the extreme Greens political party always do. We've seen on many occasions, particularly of late, that the opposition and the extreme Greens political party are all about the headlines. That's all they're about—the headlines, not the hard work of reform and implementing sensible and effective changes that actually protect our environment and also secure our future energy sources. It's so important that we transition to renewable energy but at the same time keep the lights on. We have to do that sensibly, and we are doing that, absolutely. But particularly we see the opposition and the extreme Greens just chasing those headlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even last week, it was quite hard to believe that, in the Senate, we saw the Greens teaming up with One Nation to try and delay the Senate inquiry in relation to setting up the first national environment protection agency. There you've got the Greens with One Nation trying to delay the protection of our environment. As the member for Blair and the member for Cunningham pointed out, when members of the extreme Greens spoke, including the leader, the member for Brisbane and the member for Griffith, they didn't actually address anything in the bill at all. They just spread a lot of misinformation, as they often do. They referred to a recent approval, claiming that there was no protection for koala habitat, whereas, as the minister said here in question time, there were very strict conditions. There was no koala breeding or foraging habitat that can be cleared in relation to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We constantly see misinformation from the Greens political party. They claim they want to conserve forests, but it wasn't that long ago that we had a Greens senator who was proposing to bulldoze koala habitat to build three luxury investment properties. It was outrageous, and people are still outraged, as we often see that hypocrisy from the party of protest—the extreme Greens. We see it with the environment. We see it again and again with housing. They'll block every initiative that they can when it comes to housing. It is absolutely unbelievable. It's certainly an issue that people raise with me locally about how extreme the Greens are and how they hold up any good reforms that are in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we also see the Liberals and Nationals. Let's look at their record. When the Albanese Labor government was elected, the minister released the official five-yearly report card on the Australian environment, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span> s<span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the environment</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2021</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report. It had been previously hidden by the previous Liberal-National government. It was just horrific—a catalogue of horrors! It shows how much damage in a decade the opposition did in terms of their neglect when it comes to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report told us that Australia's environment was in a very bad shape and getting worse. It's quite staggering when we actually look at some of the details of what it found. It found that Australia has lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent. It found that for the first time Australia has more foreign plant species than native. It found that habitat the size of Tasmania has been cleared. It found that plastics are choking our ocean—up to 80,000 pieces of plastics per square kilometre. And it found that flows in most Murray-Darling rivers had reached record low levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fairly confronting when we look through lists like that and we see the absolute neglect by the previous government when it came to the environment, right across the board. There was a lot of work for us to do in terms of that decade of neglect. With a lot of the initiatives that we've brought forward, we've certainly heard from many people that they're very pleased that we are in government and we are taking this decisive action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also listen to other experts. In fact, Professor Graeme Samuel said that the government and the minister are doing everything exactly as they should be, and 'I don't underestimate the complexity of what has to be done.' ACF said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ACF welcomes the government's announcement that it will set up an agency to enforce environmental laws—something previous governments failed to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Marine Conservation Society said, 'These new institutions are essential and welcome.' These groups know how important it is to be proactive when it comes to protecting our environment. In fact, the Business Council of Australia said that the government is taking the right step, because business needs certainty as well. It's vitally important. The Urban Development Institute of Australia said, 'The minister is doing the right thing.' The National Farmers Federation said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our members have said for years that the current Act is broken. It's hard to engage with producers who want to do the right thing, and in some instances it's preventing best practice management of the landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are addressing all those concerns, right across the board, by the establishment of these particular agencies. We know that it is absolutely the right thing to do, and that's because we, on this side of the House, understand how important it is to address all the complexities when it comes to protecting our environment. It's about addressing climate change and environmental protection through our really decisive action, while also, of course, examining the economic and business realities, as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the minister, and many of us on this side, has been working with many different groups in our communities and hearing firsthand, as we have for years, about the action that needs to be taken. We have done a lot by establishing the Net Zero Economy Agency to have a focus on economic opportunities for the regions, which is important. We've set up our National Electric Vehicle Strategy. We're also rolling out 400 community batteries across the country. It's really important to have that in place, too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that these bills that we're looking at today, the three nature positive bills, represent a really groundbreaking step towards our commitment to preserving our incredible landscapes and what is, as we all know, our very unique biodiversity and our very rich ecosystems, which we are so fortunate to have in this country. But it takes time, commitment, investment and a long-term vision to make sure that this is all in place. That's why we have had so many ongoing stages when it comes to the reform. We need to make sure it's all in place. It really is a new era of environmental conservation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also recognise the urgent need to act longer term as well, to ensure that all of those challenges are met, particularly when it comes to addressing climate change. A lot of work has to be done because we've had so much environmental degradation under the previous government. That's why there is an urgency about starting all of this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we, those of us in the Albanese Labor government, are very proud to be taking this decisive action. We went to the election, put it to the Australian people, and they elected us so that we can take action on a number of fronts. And one of those absolutely includes taking action on climate change and addressing the needs of our environment. That's exactly what we're doing and we're very proud to be doing that. I commend all of these bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024 and the two related bills. As a farmer by trade, I know thing or two about working the land. I know a thing or two about being environmentally savvy. I also know a thing or two about what it takes to protect the environment and to leave the land better than when you found it, which is something the Albanese Labor government is simply not doing. This Albanese Labor government will have the Australian public believe that those who worked the land are the problem. You can see this in all of their rushed legislation that they're trying to bring in or have brought in. Right across Australia they've attacked our farmers, they've attacked our fishers and they've attacked our logging industry, which I know is a major cause of concern for my colleagues down south. Those opposite say they want a future made in Australia, but the Albanese Labor government are MIA when it comes to Australia's future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to home, in my electorate of Dawson, the Minister for the Environment and Water bowed down to UNESCO's 10 demands, including the bans on gillnet fishing. This is a decision that has put Australia's sustainable wild-caught fishing industry in jeopardy. The reality is though—and I say this based on decades of experience—that those of us who have made a living out of working on the land look after our rivers and our oceans. We rely on these ecosystems not only to survive but to thrive. Without these thriving ecosystems there would be nothing there for us to harvest. We would lose our ability to make a living. We would lose our ability to pay our bills, and we would lose our ability to feed our families and to feed our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aussie farmers and fishers are Australia's biggest environmental warriors. We know what it takes. More importantly, we do what it takes to ensure that our land and our waterways are healthy. Anyone who says otherwise has never been a farmer. Those opposite are persecuting us at every turn, with more and more paperwork, more regulation and even monitoring the amount of fertiliser we use, claiming that we are the problem. What an absolute joke! Anyone who thinks a farmer wastes fertiliser has never had to pay for the stuff. Farmers are nature positive, unlike this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could stand here in this House and tell you all about how lazy the Albanese Labor government are when it comes to their policy and legislation. I could tell you how lacklustre this government have been. I could tell you exactly how much they do not care about rural and regional Australia, and that the only thing they care about is putting out political agendas and marketing spin to draw on the heartstrings of those inner city voters. And yet, they make no real effort towards positive change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here and I say this and, yes, I will yell it from the rooftops if I have to: let's actually have a look at a few of the examples of how those opposite have already let the Australian public down and how they continue to let the Australian public down. I've already mentioned the minister's ban on the use of commercial gillnets right across Queensland, impacting Australia's fishos and removing 2,000 tonnes of Australian wild-caught seafood from the market. This decision was rushed and not based on science. It was pushed through by the Labor government without consultation with the local fishing industry and without any plan for if or when these men and women were going to be compensated, leaving all of them scared for their future and their families, which for most spans back many generations—all with a stroke of a pen from Canberra by a minister who, when invited to my electorate to speak with these fishers and to consult with the experts and all of the industry, just refused. Tell me how that works, Minister? Please tell me, because I really struggle with this concept. I say it again: this decision was rushed through without any scientific backing. It's a pattern that we've seen emerge from this one-term government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What else have those opposite done that goes against protecting the environment or that goes against protecting Australia's future? As a display of hypocrisy at its best, the Albanese Labor government wants to destroy thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land and native vegetation for this reckless race to renewables. Let me be clear: I am not against renewable energy. I love renewable energy. But you have to do it sensibly and you have to do it in the right place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of clearing the plant life that naturally removes carbon dioxide from the air and turns this into oxygen through a process called photosynthesis—those opposite might want to google that and see what photosynthesis does—they want to build massive metal wind turbines that only produce energy when the wind blows—but not too much wind because they won't work then either. Those opposite want to fill thousands of hectares of land with giant solar panels that can't be recycled at the end of their life, which is only about 10 to 15 years. And then where do they go? They go straight into landfill, and then the landfill has to be monitored forever. Now, that is not very nature positive, is it? In fact, I'd have to say that's nature negative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of having a mature discussion after looking at its viability, safety and potential, the Labor government won't even talk to us about zero emission nuclear technology that would provide continuous and reliable power 24 hours a day, seven days a week; have a life expectancy of 80 years; and take up a physical footprint that is only a small percentage of that under the renewables plan. Instead, those opposite are utilising scare campaigns, with images of three-eyed fish from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Simpsons</span>. Australia already has a nuclear industry in Sydney. Where are the three-eyed fish there? Refusing to have a mature discussion about zero emission technology that lasts for decades and choosing to bulldoze thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land and native vegetation instead is certainly not nature positive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite gagged debate on the family ute and car tax and rushed that legislation through without bothering to stop and consider the consequences for those of us living in rural and regional areas, where the infrastructure to power electric vehicles simply does not exist. It's nowhere to be found. In my electorate of Dawson, we are the biggest cane-farming region in Australia, we have farmers growing beautiful Bowen mangoes, we have a half-a-billion-dollar horticultural crop and we supply food for the entire nation. What this government doesn't understand is that our farmers and food producers can't use electric vehicles, because they're not fit for purpose. They can't carry the weight, they can't tow the load and they cannot travel the vast distances that we need to be able to travel. As a result, our farmers are going to be charged thousands of dollars more for their vehicles just for the privilege of feeding our nation and keeping our nation alive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is abundantly clear that the Labor government are not interested in the welfare of Australia or the Australian environment. Those opposite are playing a game of pass the parcel with Australia's future, and you never know what you're going to find under each new layer of bureaucratic paper. Now we have had these rushed nature positive bills through from Minister Plibersek. Nothing about these bills is very nature positive at all, but everything about them is Australia negative. These bills are going to be bad for business, bad for the economy and bad for every Australian who is trying to work hard and get on with the job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get to the reality of the situation. If Labor get their way with this legislation, we are going have yet another environmental protection agency handed millions of dollars to do exactly what all the other environmental organisations have been established to do. The minister is handing over all the power to these organisations before even legislating how they will work—another pattern emerging from the Albanese Labor government. This is what happens when you have a prime minister that provides weak leadership; it filters down through the whole organisation. As the fishos in my electorate say, 'The fish rots from the head.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have the Environmental Defenders Office, who come after legitimate projects and shut them down. But where are they when it comes to defending the environment as a Labor government is decimating thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land, native vegetation and koala habitats to put up wind farms and solar panels that all end up in landfill? There is nothing renewable about these renewables. The Environmental Defenders Office is nowhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, the minister wants to legislate another body that is a duplication of something that already exists. But that isn't even the most sinister part of this bill. This organisation won't have to report to anyone, not even the minister. They will have all the power to walk into a workplace and shut your business down, stop your projects and hand over enormous fines, and all they will have to say is, 'We have reasonable suspicion to do it.' Whose version of reasonable is reasonable, though, Minister? Nothing those opposite have done so far has shown me that they are reasonable. This is nothing but green lawfare on business and on the hardworking Aussies just trying to do their bit and get on with their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't an environmental protection agency; this is an environmental union. This minister wants to give this organisation union power, and the scary thing is it is going to hurt everyone. Yes, it's going to hurt big business and, yes, it's going to hurt small business too. This environmental union will be able to walk into any business—restaurants, hairdressers, accountants, engineering shops and your local fish and chip shops—and force them to stop trading. If they want to shut you down, they will be able to do this. I will not be supporting this bill. As I've clearly demonstrated, this bill is not nature positive; on the contrary, this bill is nature negative.</span>

                    </a>  I'll take your interjection, Member for Dawson—apart from running a scaremongering campaign based on the idea that, on that side of the chamber, you know farmers and, on this side of the chamber, we don't know farmers—'You're bad; we're good.' Newsflash, buddy: without a productive, safe, positive environment, our farmlands don't work, and I know that because I spent quite a lot of my youth growing up on family farms. I was also lucky that my father spent quite a long time with the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. I had a firsthand experience of going with him on 'Take your kid to work' days. I got to see what happens when we don't take care of our environment. Soil degradation and higher salinity levels make farming harder and production drops off. It is important that we take care of our environment because, without our environment, we don't have anywhere to live and, as the member for Dawson likes to rightly point out, we can't grow crops. Yes, we need to feed the nation, but we also need lands that support that production of food and, importantly, we need an environment that is supported by good policy to ensure that that land remains productive and safe for generations to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024 and the related bills essentially go towards. It's about setting a framework where you can look to the future and know with a high level of certainty that we are going to have an environment that is habitable, that is productive for food production and where farmers are profitable. This is not about shutting down farming; this is about working with farmers, working with our agricultural sector, working with our environment. It's about having a positive environment so that we can work positively with farmers and people to live in harmony. I really have to say that the member for Dawson needs to pull his head out of his proverbial and see the sunlight. We constantly hear this rhetoric about wind towers taking up land that we can't farm on. Actually, the truth is that you can still farm around your wind towers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I want to share the concerns of parents in Wentworth about the harmful impact of social media on young people. Over the past two years, I've had countless conversations with people across the community who are worried about what social media is doing to our kids. Nearly 400 responded to my recent survey about how to keep kids safe online. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they were extremely concerned about the impact of social media on young people's mental health, showing the extent of parental anxiety in my community. People's concerns related to a broad range of issues, with most parents in Wentworth worried about multiple negative impacts that social media can have on kids' health. More than 80 per cent were concerned about online bullying, social media addiction and access that kids have to pornography, and a further three-quarters said they were worried about eating disorder content and the promotion of negative role models.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome today's announcement from the eSafety Commissioner that she will give internet companies six months to develop an industry code that dictates what minors are exposed to on their platforms. But we have to go further. In my community survey, there was substantial support for a range of actions from government and social media companies, including inducing tools to report harmful content, banning gambling and alcohol ads—I was just speaking to a young man in year 11 last night who was talking about how many gambling and alcohol ads he is served on his social media, despite being well under the age when he should be receiving those ads—increasing the transparency on social media algorithms and creating an overarching duty of care for social media companies to protect the wellbeing of young people online. Parents also raised the importance of better education for children so they know how to use social media safely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The solutions favoured by people in Wentworth closely reflect the recommendations from work conducted by the Butterfly Foundation and Zoe Daniel MP, and I commend them for their work. I also commend the work of community campaigners like the team at Wait Mate, a Wentworth based organisation that has recently started to help families come together in their schools and in their local communities to slow the spread of smartphone use by young kids. My community was also open and certainly interested in the idea of banning social media access to those below the age of 16.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impacts of social media are just one of the mental health challenges facing people in Wentworth. And I want to talk for a moment about the difficulties experienced by people in our community with complex mental health conditions. The tragic events at Bondi Junction in April highlight the urgent need to better support people who have complex mental health conditions. Since the attack, I have been contacted by family and friends of people suffering complex conditions, telling me about the challenges they face every day in caring for their loved ones. Those suffering from complex conditions are often referred to as the 'missing middle'. But they aren't really missing at all. They're our family members, our friends and our co-workers, and they're faced with a lack of active and ongoing support, with a lack of integration between services, with staff shortages across crucial clinics and with police who lack the training to adequately respond to mental health crises when they are frequently called to the scene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are not just falling through the cracks in our mental health system; they're falling through chasms. Tomorrow morning I'll be holding a roundtable in parliament aimed at elevating the voices of people with complex mental health conditions and understanding just how much more there is to do to better support them. There are no easy answers. There are no quick fixes. We need long-term solutions, not bandaids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the important work that the federal and state governments have been doing to date, and have committed to doing, to better provide a more integrated support, including the Mental Health Reform Advisory Committee and the recently appointed peak bodies for carers and consumers. These are very positive steps forward. We need to continue this work and expand it. The unifying call from 17 mental health organisations coming to parliament tomorrow is for long-term funding and reform that is agreed to during the upcoming Health Ministers' Meeting and that is enshrined in the National Health Reform Agreement. I urge the government to listen to the experts who are coming to share those stories.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Next week is NAIDOC Week, which began nearly 50 years ago to raise awareness and to celebrate the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In light of NAIDOC Week, I want to acknowledge the history and achievements of Ian Hamm, a Yorta Yorta man and constituent in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian chaired Victoria's Stolen Generations Reparations Steering Committee, which provided advice and recommendations on the design of Victoria's stolen generations reparations. Ian has made a huge contribution to community and not-for-profit groups and devotes significant time to improving Aboriginal people's representation on boards and in governance roles. He has worked in senior roles in the Commonwealth government and the Victorian government and has been chair and board member of a number of major not-for-profit organisations. Ian has been prominent in promoting the economic empowerment of Indigenous people, including through Indigenous owned and managed businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian was taken from his birth mother when he was just three weeks old. Ian didn't find out about his origins until he was an adult but made up for lost time after connecting with his four siblings, cousins and extended family in the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, he never got to meet his mother, who died in the same year he was taken from her. His aunt said that they were always struck by how similar he was in character to his mother.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme of this year's NAIDOC Week is 'Keep the Fire Burning! Blak, Loud and Proud'. It honours the enduring strength and vitality of First Nations culture, with fire as a symbol of connection to country and to each other. Ian Hamm embodies that strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a large and vibrant Nepalese community in my electorate and right across the broader Melbourne north-west. Canberra is also home to a strong Nepalese community. Last week, I met with leaders from Melbourne's and Canberra's Nepalese communities in Parliament House. The Nepalese community is the second-fastest-growing migrant community in Australia. There are many Nepalese students in Australia studying at universities and VET providers. Indeed, they are the third-largest student body in Australia. Nepalis also make a huge contribution to the aged-care and hospitality sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met Bom Yonzon, the leader of the Nepalese community in my electorate and President of the Federation of Nepalese Community Associations in Australia. The federation recently marked International Everest Day by talking about the significance of the mountain to Nepalese culture and to the Nepalese economy—for example, through tourism. Everest Day is also a time to consider the threat to the Himalayas from global warming and climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Federation of Nepalese Community Associations in Australia is undertaking important work in raising awareness of the problems and issues faced by new immigrants, students and temporary workers, including by providing settlement services and support for mental health, family violence, financial hardship, workplace discrimination and dealing with a lack of representation in elected bodies. They also do so much for the young people in the community, including through holding major sporting festivals in Melbourne and right around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to bring attention to the very important work done by the East African Women's Foundation, not only in my electorate but, again, right across Melbourne's west and north. This group helps women in vulnerable situations to deal with social isolation, family violence and financial vulnerability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The East African Women's Foundation is a key partner of the Western Bulldogs Community Foundation and, through this, has helped numerous women participate in the Daughters of the West program. This is a fantastic program that helps women with their health, their social connectedness and their overall wellbeing. I felt very privileged to attend a graduation ceremony of women from the African communities in my electorate who had graduated from the Western Bulldogs Daughters of the West program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The East African Women's Foundation is also a leader in dealing with complex social issues. I recently met with the foundation to discuss their concerns in relation to the practice of female genital mutilation. The foundation says that too little is being done to stop the practice and that many women in the Somali community in particular report that there is little information available to help them or legal advice to help them protect their children. The foundation is seeking to establish a network to advise and inform affected communities, health professionals and social workers, and to provide support for victims of female genital mutilation. I look forward to partnering with the foundation on all its important work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Labor, with its renewables-only energy policies, is forcing regional Australia and Australians to be simply the repositories of wind turbines and solar panels. In my electorate, my communities certainly don't support Labor's proposal for a massive offshore wind farm in Geographe Bay. I say 'massive' because it is. It is 7,674 square kilometres and it will generate 20 gigawatts of renewable energy. That's what the proposal is. That's at least, when you sit down and look at it, a thousand wind turbines. The height-to-tip height is 268 metres. That is in the most amazing part of not just Western Australia but, we think, Australia—in Geographe Bay, from Cape Naturaliste right through to Mandurah.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a look at some of the largest offshore wind farms elsewhere. In the UK the largest one is 3.6 gigawatts, not 20 gigawatts like the plan here. The UK version is at Dogger Bank. It will have only 277 turbines when it's completed. What's being planned here, the 7,674 square kilometres offshore at Geographe Bay, is almost the total size on land of my whole electorate. That's what's being planned for the south-west of Western Australia. Geographe Bay is an iconic part of Western Australia. It is certainly the wrong place for this massive wind factory, as I call it. My communities are definitely not supportive of this, and they are certainly not supportive of being the repository for Labor 's renewables-only energy policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at what's being proposed we see there was a terrible process used. There was supposed to be consultation. There was anything but. And the community has reacted really badly to that. As I said, Geographe Bay is iconic and it is just beautiful. It is the place where both domestic and international visitors come for holidays. It's where locals and visitors alike enjoy diving, fishing, camping, recreational and commercial fishing, and boating. It's a resting ground for whales before migration north and south. It's a nursery habitat for many shelf species such as the dusky whaler shark and our western rock lobsters. And we're going to see an enormous amount of aquatic environmental damage during construction, and, of course, the impact of electromagnetic fields in both the construction and operation. There will undoubtedly be an impact on birdlife.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're told by the department that we won't even know how many wind turbines there will be in total; the area will simply be declared and then it'll develop from there. We're told that they don't even know what the exclusion zones will be. They could range from 50 metres to 500 metres around each turbine. We won't know what these are. The community will have this foisted on them. And we won't know what the exclusion zones are for at least 10 to 12 years, after the approvals have been put in place—too late. This will certainly affect recreational boating and fishing and commercial fishing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the social licence issue here, the consultation process has been absolutely appalling. But what we fear most is being simply rolled over—that Labor will be determined to steamroll us in the south-west and simply wave this through because it is a renewable energy project, without considering the damage that will occur in our local environment. Geographe Bay is pristine. As I said, we get people from all over the world. I would say that it is one of the most visited areas by domestic and overseas visitors not only in Western Australia but in Australia, and it's over 7,600 square kilometres. That's a number that I want people to consider with the sheer number and volume of wind turbines in Geographe Bay. Of course, the heights alone really need to be seriously considered when looking at this—we are talking about them being close to 300 metres in height—and the effect on our natural environment.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  The Albanese Labor government is a big supporter of rugby league. The North Ipswich Reserve in my electorate is getting $20 million as part of a $40 million stage 1 upgrade, along with $10 million from the Miles Labor government and $10 million from the Ipswich City Council. I'm a Brisbane Broncos supporter, but I'm also a supporter, in the Hostplus Cup, of the Ipswich Jets and a regular attendee at the North Ipswich Reserve. I say tonight to the National Rugby League CEO Andrew Abdo and the ARL Commission's Peter V'landys that it's time for a team in the NRL with the moniker 'Jets' in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are 17 teams in the NRL, and the NRL has had a variety of different numbers. When it was re-formed in 1998 with the merger of the Australian Super league and the ARL, there were 20 teams. Teams have come and gone, and, fortunately for me—can I just say, as a great supporter of rugby league along with the Prime Minister—the South Sydney Rabbitohs were re-admitted in 2002. The Redcliffe Dolphins were expanded in 2021 and admitted last year and are a success. The Ipswich Jets unfortunately missed out in their bid for that licence, and it went to the Dolphins. But Ipswich is the fastest-growing area in South-East Queensland and probably in all of Queensland. I know that, in April 2021, the NRL were considering an 18-team competition. In March last year, there were news reports that the NRL were talking about a 20-team competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is a supporter of rugby league not just here in Australia. We are giving $600 million to the Papua New Guinea government for rugby league over a 10-year period to expand the game and for associated programs as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ipswich has a long and proud history of rugby league from the Bulimba Cup days, playing against Toowoomba and Brisbane. We provided the front row of the Australian Kangaroos in 1959: Gary Parcell, Noel Kelly and Dud Beattie. Who can forget in the 1950s, Denis Flannery, the Kangaroo Flyer, or the legendary Hughie O'Doherty, who played for Valleys in the seventies? There were rugby league legends like Alan 'Alfie' Langer and Kevin, Kerrod and Steve Walters. Now there's Ali Brigginshaw, an Ipswich girl who plays for the Broncos, Queensland and Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NRL is thinking about 20 teams. There's talk about a North Sydney Bears team. I reckon a Perth Bears team would be good. They could play in red and black and, of course, the yellow and black of Western Australia. I know the Premier of WA, Roger Cook, wants a team over there, but what about the Jets? I know that PNG want a team. That would be the 18th or 19th team, but the Jets should be the 20th team. We've got 8,000 players in Ipswich and 7,000 in Toowoomba in the rugby league corridor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the Newtown team is called the Jets. I know that the Ipswich team is called the Jets. Ipswich plays in green and white, and Newtown plays in blue and white. There's a connection, because a legendary New South Wales player and Australian captain Tommy Raudonikis played for the Newtown Jets and scored a try in that last grand final when they got beaten 20-11 by Parramatta. But he coached the Ipswich Jets to their first-ever grand final. I was talking to Steve 'Johnno' Johnson, the chair of the Ipswich Jets, tonight to have a bit of a yarn about rugby league and Ipswich, and Johnno reminded me how much Tommy loved Newtown and Ipswich—both called the Jets. That would be fantastic—what great symmetry to have a team in the NRL called the Jets!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really important for a few reasons—one being the history of rugby league in Sydney and the history of rugby league in Brisbane and surrounds. Those merger teams have been very successful. We have seen the Brisbane Lions take in the heritage of the Fitzroy Lions and you can see it at Brighton Homes Arena, with the heritage and history of that merger honoured. We have seen it with the Sydney Swans and South Melbourne Swans. Why can't we do it with the idea of the Newtown Jets and the Ipswich Jets playing in green and blue and white?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the NRL: it is time for an Ipswich team. It is time to bring back the Jets. It is time to bring back those colours. It would not only be welcomed, I say, in Sydney and Brisbane and surrounds but it would back in Ipswich and that great corridor west of Brisbane from Ipswich all through to Toowoomba, the home of great heritage. Back the Jets; support an NRL team by the name of the Jets in the NRL.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  On Anzac Day, Australians gather in towns and cities around the structures we know as war memorials, of which there are around 5,000 in towns and suburbs throughout our country. Many small towns erected these structures to commemorate and remember their dead in the aftermath of the devastation of World War I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian War Memorial here in Canberra is a memorial and museum dedicated to the preservation of Australia's war history. Its vision was articulated by its founder, Charles Bean, who witnessed Australians fighting from the Gallipoli landing to the Western Front and through to the Armistice. When he returned from the front, Charles Bean simply wrote 'blackened men everywhere, torn and whole, dead for days'. A mortally wounded Australian asked of him: 'Will they remember me in Australia?' Bean, in announcing the memorial, said, 'Here is their spirit in the heart of the land they loved and here we guard the record in which they themselves made.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Will they remember me in Australia?' Well, we remember them throughout Australia and especially at the Australian War Memorial. The Roll of Honour records the names of over 103,000 members of the Australian armed forces who have died during or as a result of war. When we visit the memorial we are struck by the serenity, the stillness, the simplicity, the poignancy, the respect, the remembrance, the tomb of the unknown soldier, the Flanders poppies that adorn the Roll of Honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, what occurred on 14 June and last Saturday night with the defacing of the Australian War Memorial and the Korean and Vietnam War memorials on Anzac Parade in Canberra was a most egregious and despicable act, an attack on one of our most important national sites and on one of our most important traditions. There was desecration through graffiti with words of violence, including 'river to the sea' and 'blood on your hands'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, even more despicable and egregious has been the response of the Greens party to this desecration. Yesterday, the Greens in the other place, led by Senator Steele-John, with the imprimatur of his leader, refused to support a motion containing the defacing of the memorials. The excuse given was a nebulous link that graffiti represented freedom of speech and a peaceful protest. The hypocrisy from the Greens is this: the very reason that the members of the Greens party have the privilege of being able to serve in this place and the other, the privilege of living in a democratic country that has ideals of freedom of speech and expression, that allows peaceful protest, is because of the men and women of our defence forces who have sacrificed themselves, many of whom made the sacrifice to ensure that future Australians could enjoy these very freedoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens, by their behaviour, by their refusal to condemn these acts have again demonstrated they are an extremist party, out of touch with most Australians, out of touch with the very values and moral code that underpin us as a nation. The Greens respect our right to protest provided it is on an issue of their choosing. The Greens proclaim freedom of speech, provided it is in line with their ideology. The Greens speak for equity for the disabled, provided the disabled are not members of our defence forces. The Greens will stand up for those killed in conflict, provided they are not members of our ADF. The Greens condemn genocide, provided it is not the Holocaust. The Greens support a safe workplace, safe education, provided the workers and the students are not Jewish. The Greens espouse the importance of our history, provided it is their version of history, provided it does not remember or acknowledge the heroism of Australians in war and peacekeeping missions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our military history matters to most Australians and when this or other memorials are graffitied we disrespect that history, we disrespect those 103,000 who are listed on the Roll of Honour. And we also disrespect every other Australian who has served our country in the ADF—who has served our country willingly, bravely and often at great personal cost and sacrifice. Often, they return very different from the way that they left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Will we remember in Australia? Yes. To that unknown soldier: we will remember you and we will continue to support the monuments, the memorials and the museums that support and remember your service. And, at every opportunity, we will call out and we will condemn all and every attempt to do otherwise. The Greens should have condemned the defacing of these memorials; their failure to do so means that the Greens themselves stand condemned.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  This week, the Australian Labor government is wiping $300 from the power bills of every Australian household. At the same time, we continue to roll out the plan we took to the election for cleaner and cheaper power across the nation. By contrast, the Leader of the Opposition is proposing to inflict on Australian households and businesses the most expensive form of energy there is. The opposition leader was a senior minister in the former Liberal government, Over 10 years in office, the Liberals proposed 22 energy plans and failed to land even one. The Liberal version of net zero is propose 22, deliver zero.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But none of those 22 failed plans included nuclear as an option. When someone mused whether nuclear should be in the mix, a conga line of Liberal ministers, including the now Leader of the Opposition, told Australians why it was a bad idea: too expensive, too slow to deliver and nowhere to store the waste. Those reasons remain. Nuclear is simply the wrong solution for Australia's energy needs. The opposition leader's new-found nuclear obsession is a blank cheque for a bad bet. But it's the mums and dads of Australia that he will stiff with the bill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leader has kept the details locked in a bottom drawer but, luckily for Australia, the CSIRO has done the numbers. The cost of power from nuclear reactors is up to eight times more expensive than from firmed renewables—not twice as expensive, not three times or even four times: eight times! Take a bill from today, multiply it by eight and that's what you're looking at. The Smart Energy Council revealed that building seven reactors could cost taxpayers as much as $600 billion. It's nuts—completely bonkers! And, to top it off, by the opposition leader's own estimates, no reactor will generate power until at least 2035. But if the Liberals win next year's election, they have to get nuclear laws through both the House and the Senate—and we've all seen the Senate. Then there's all the paperwork and the inevitable legal challenges and protests. It's a sure bet that no reactor will be online inside of 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his budget reply speech, the Leader of the Opposition dismissed the capacity of renewable energy, despite Australia's obvious natural advantages. 'There's no need for the proposed solar panels, wind farms and new transmission poles and wires,' he said. Incentives to boost critical mineral processing and green hydrogen to drive a homegrown renewable energy sector were dismissed as 'corporate welfare'. Let's get this straight: securing a made-in-Australia renewable energy supply chain is corporate welfare, but spending $600 billion of taxpayers' money on foreign supplied nuclear reactors is fair dinkum?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a simple fact that driving more investment in renewables drives down emissions, creates thousands of jobs in the regions and advances Australia's bright future as a renewable energy superpower. And it's all at risk because the Liberals are recklessly spooking investors. The party of business has become the party of tinfoil hats. As a regional MP, I am deeply concerned that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are on the line. Earlier this year, I joined ministers to announce a $70 million federal investment to help build the Bell Bay Hydrogen Hub. It will produce 45,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen a year—enough to fuel more than 2,200 heavy vehicles—and it will create more than 700 jobs in northern Tasmania. Is that what the opposition leader means by 'corporate welfare'? How many Tasmanian engineers, technicians, truckies, plumbers, concreters, fitters and sparkies do the Liberals want unemployed, instead of contributing to energy transformation? I wonder if the management of the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone shares the opposition leader's view about the so-called corporate welfare that the zone is receiving to develop green hydrogen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage, the known details of the Liberals' nuclear obsession fit on the dry corner of a wet beer coaster. What we already know is that nuclear is too slow to build and too expensive to deliver. Australians deserve the cleaner and cheaper energy that Labor is delivering today, not a risky Liberal nuclear obsession that smashes energy investment, takes 20 years to deliver and drives up power bills.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  This government did promise more transparent and accessible grants programs, but so far nothing has been delivered, and we are well over two years into this term. It is causing significant prejudice to organisations needing key infrastructure funding. The federal government needs to stop further delay with two of its key grants programs: the Urban Precincts and Partnerships Program and the Thriving Suburbs Program. These two programs were announced in May 2023 in the federal budget by Minister Catherine King after cancelling the previous grants process. Now, I don't disagree that there were major concerns in relation to pork-barrelling and the integrity of the previous process, but the difficulty is that it simply has not been replaced with the promised new grants process and the rigorous integrity that should be around that. We have very key organisations within communities like mine in Warringah waiting to apply, with no avenue for funding for this kind of infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Warringah, for example, the Manly Warringah Gymnastics Club hopes to construct a purpose-built, world-class gymnastics and multisport facility at Nolan Reserve in North Manly. The two-year, $10 million, club funded project will guarantee the club's 2,000-plus members a home for the next three decades and open new and exciting opportunities for the wider community. It's anticipated that the facility will be recognised by Gymnastics Australia and Gymnastics New South Wales as a centre of excellence for high-performance gymnastics and trampoline, and it is designed to cater for all sports that include aerial movements, such as snow sports, diving, skateboarding, surfing and acrobatics, through the Clubs NSW and NSW Institute of Sport endorsed aerial academy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding is needed for this project, and it's exactly the type of project these grants programs under Minister King are meant to help with. In particular, it's also a sustainable, state-of-the-art project, fully sustainable from an energy efficiency point of view, with rooftop solar and batteries associated. It has huge participation from women; over 70 per cent of participants in the sports are female. And it's a feeder area and support for the pathway to the Brisbane 2032 Olympics. The difficulty is that we've got key projects like this where funding is not being delivered or there is no opportunity to apply for funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A similar project is the Manly Life Saving Club, which secured $5 million previously, but there's a shortfall now due to increased building costs and delays. There is simply no opportunity to apply for additional funding. This is a lifesaving club that provides two-flag patrols for Manly Beach, voted No. 1 in Australia. I urge the government to deliver these grant pathways.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  People across the community of Barton can look forward to cost-of-living relief thanks to our government. The Albanese Labor government are delivering for every Australian because we are a government for all Australians. Here's what we delivered yesterday: every Australian taxpayer, not just some, gets a tax cut. Our $300 energy bill relief is beginning to flow. Backed in by our government, 2.6 million low-paid workers are getting their third consecutive pay rise. There will be cheaper medicines. We're providing cost-of-living support while putting downward pressure on inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many people in our community are doing it really tough. While our government is providing more help, we're not doing it alone. Community organisations in our community, powered by volunteers, play an important role. During National Volunteer Week, I held a morning tea to thank our community organisations and their volunteers. Around 100 people joined me for a cup of tea and a very large cake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What brings volunteers together is a passion for making our community a better place. You can see that passion in volunteers like the late Michael Shiel, a volunteer with Gift of Bread. It was a privilege to present a posthumous community award to his mother, Patricia, and recognise his work. Patricia herself has fostered over 200 children—quite amazing. There are also volunteers like Helen Dwyer, who has given 40 years to 1st Hurstville Scouts. I would like to thank chair Russell Foxe, manager Lala, and assistant manager Laura at the Kogarah Storehouse, who hosted us for the morning tea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteerism is an important part of who we are in our Barton community and, I know, in all communities across Australia. So, next time you see a volunteer in your community, give them a big thanks for all that they do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286535" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  I rise today to speak on the magnificent work being done in my electorate of Dawson. Sixteen-year-old Cadet Sergeant Murray Macgroarty has taken things into his own hands, raising awareness and funds for the ongoing issue of veterans' homelessness. This young citizen committed to walking 382 kilometres around the Mackay Bluewater Quay—a distance equivalent to that between the Mackay Army Reserve barracks and the Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. Murray's journey, titled Just Keep Marching, empowers his community to develop a local solution to this national problem. Working with the RSL Mackay Sub Branch, he brought his dream to light, completing the final lap yesterday afternoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just Keep Marching saw the community of Mackay come together to advocate for our veterans. To use Murray's words: 'Our veterans served our country; it's time that our country serves them.' Throughout Murray's research, he has noted that veterans are nearly three times more likely to experience homelessness in Australia, and yet veterans' access to homelessness support is three times less than that for the general population. Concerned, Murray was puzzled about how a developed, first-world country like Australia could possibly let this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meeting with Murray, it was no surprise that he has a passion for finding a solution to the problem. His dedication and the dedication of those around him who made this event possible reflect how hard work and passion can bring about positive outcomes for our homeless veterans in communities all across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past nine days, Murray has been surrounded by members of the community who have joined him and walked the 16-kilometre lap around Mackay. This sense of community support has made clear to me that, in Mackay, as reflected across the nation, communities believe strongly in a solution to this problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In taking Murray's fight to Canberra, I congratulate him, his mum, Cynthy, and all those who have helped him on his journey for the incredible work that they have done. I hope this journey is the start of some real action to deliver positive outcomes for our veterans. Good on you, Murray!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This statement was written by Rory McPhail from Holy Spirit College Mackay and Nate Ralph from Northern Beaches State High School, who are friends of Murray's and have been doing work experience in my office for the last couple of weeks. Well done, Murray, Rory and Nate. It's always a pleasure to meet tenacious and motivated young men like yourselves, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for all of you fine young men.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  For 35 years we've been celebrating National Volunteers Week in Australia, and, for all of the time that I've been the member for Port Adelaide and Hindmarsh, I've commemorated that in a volunteer award ceremony in my electorate. So many groups—religious organisations, sporting clubs, and many other community service organisations—are only able to do the great work they do because of the time, energy, love and skills that literally thousands of volunteers contribute in my electorate, and I know that is seen right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always recognise young volunteers who start their life volunteering and, overwhelmingly, continue that effort right through the rest of their lives. There were five winners of the youth awards that were awarded last month: Louis Gregg, who is a coach at the Adelaide Jaguars Women's Soccer Club, a terrific club in Adelaide; Theodore Koutsoubis, who volunteers as an altar server at the Nativity of Christ Greek Orthodox Church in Port Adelaide and has been doing that since he was about six or seven years of age; Jai Gardener, who has got an extraordinary record already with the Henley Surf Life Saving Club; Jayasri Panthuri, who volunteers with the Telugu Association of South Australia, including by doing great fundraising for bushfire emergency relief work; and Kashvi Velidandla, who volunteers for that same association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have always recognised local legends, volunteers who go above and beyond. They're nominated by the club or the organisation for which they volunteer. It's hard to pick five out of our electorate. There are dozens of them who receive awards every single year. I just want to mention the five who were nominated for particular recognition: David Wass, who volunteers at the Camden Community Centre's Woodwork Shed and supervises the men's shed in that organisation; Rose Darling, who runs Chats, a terrific service in Port Adelaide that supports people who are experiencing homelessness; Melanie Carter, a dedicated long-term volunteer, particularly in the environmental sector in my community, who works with the Port Environment Centre and the Friends of Taperoo Dunes group; Judy Finck, the vice president and long-time umpire, coach and volunteer at the St Michael and All Angels Netball Club and a real character in that club; and Satyanarayana Seelam, who has been associated with the Telugu Association for over 10 years. He has served in pretty much every role there is within that association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to thank all of the volunteers for the time, love, energy, dedication and skills that they contribute to those organisations and thank the organisations themselves for taking time to think about who really deserves an award this year. I look forward to the ceremony again next year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  On Sunday I joined the Outback Highway Development Council, who were in Canberra hosting their very first think tank on how to add value to the amazing road infrastructure that is the Outback Way. Today they join me here in the chamber. The OHDC have done a terrific job over the past 26 years lobbying for and securing over $1.2 billion in federal, state and territory funding to literally pave the way across Australia, from Laverton in Western Australia to Winton in western Queensland. This 2,700-kilometre highway will form Australia's longest shortcut, an iconic new trans-Australia tourism route and essential freight artery, linking WA to Queensland via the Red Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The momentum has gathered, with seven shire councils across Australia collaborating to make the Outback Way a reality. Now it's time to focus on maximising the opportunities the Outback Way will present for communities along its length. Over the last two days, OHDC general manager Mel Forbes has led the charge in harnessing the enthusiasm of a new bunch of stakeholders who will help guide the next phase of the Outback Way development. They collaborated on ideas for Indigenous training, employment and business opportunities; bespoke outback tourism and cultural experiences; and of course essential communications infrastructure and support service provision. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from some terrific business owners like Kate McMaster, whose family has lived on the Plenty Highway for five generations. She owns and operates Gemtree, a unique gemstone museum and fossicking experience. Denise Brown, a 38-year tourism industry veteran, maintained that a unique point of difference will attract travellers to explore a new 'road less travelled'. Graeme Hoare, of the Livestock and Rural Transporters Association, affirmed that this new trans-Australia route will improve market access for livestock year round and enable the relocation of animals during drought or flood. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Outback Way will also provide a shorter, more direct route for the interstate movement of freight which is currently shipped by the main southern freight route. For communities along the Outback Way, this will deliver food security, counterseasonal variety and healthier fresh food. Additionally, the Outback Way will connect Australia's most remote communities to each other, availing them of better health, education and social opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would like to thank everyone who has added to the collaborative efforts and legacies of the shires along the Outback Way, their mayors, shire presidents, councillors and CEOs, who over the last 26 years have committed funding and in-kind works to help build the Outback Way. The Outback Way is truly a nation-building project, and we will all be proud to look back and say we were part of building not only the physical road but the human capital along the way. Well done.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  Today I want to talk about one of my local post offices. Post offices are important. They're places that we go to for banking, to pay for bills, to pick parcels up and, of course, to send a package either across the country or sometimes overseas. They're the sort of services that any community needs, particularly older Australians and particularly multicultural communities, like the one that I'm privileged to represent in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australia Post announced that they were closing the Auburn post office, a lot of people in my community were pretty angry and pretty upset. That was announced a couple of weeks ago. Auburn is a pretty big place in Western Sydney. It is home to about 40,000 people. About one in two people who live in Auburn live in apartments—places where secure storage for the delivery of parcels is often a challenge. That's why an after-hours parcel collection service, like that which is offered at Auburn post office, is so important. The closure of that post office would be a bad decision and something that would hurt my local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, along with my colleagues the state member for Auburn, Lynda Voltz, and the Mayor of Cumberland City Council, Lisa Lake, called on Australia Post to reverse this decision to close the Auburn post office. We made the point that Auburn needs a post office, whether it's in its current location or somewhere else in the Auburn CBD. I'm happy to advise the House that Australia Post has heard those calls from me, from my colleagues and from the broader community, and they've agreed to search for a new location and relocate the post office somewhere else inside the Auburn CBD. I can also advise that Cumberland City Council has offered to assist Australia Post in finding a new location inside Auburn CBD for the new post office. This is good news. It's a commonsense result, and it's a great result for my local community. I want to publicly thank Australia Post for this. I look forward to seeing the new post office open and continue to support my community in Auburn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise to speak about the incredible hardship that families in my electorate are experiencing. Like many members of the House of Representatives, there are food banks in the electorate that I represent, and I speak with them regularly. When we first started to see a spike in inflation, I and they noticed greater demand. In fact, I remember standing at one—the Vantage Point Community food bank—and seeing a queue of cars. In the cars were mostly women, many with children in the back. Whether it was due to the loss of a job, an illness or, for many, a family breakdown, they needed to turn to others for help. Indeed, even without those three life-changing events, people are turning to others for help. So, when we say that food prices have gone up by 11 per cent and that electricity and gas prices have gone up by 21 and 22 per cent, that has a face. That has consequences for families who are coming to the food banks in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you an example of one of the six. CareNet is feeding, on average, 240 people during a four-hour period. That's about 75 families every four hours. I remember visiting CareNet. I was getting a tour of the great facility that they have and the great work that they do when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone that I had spoken to about another issue. She was in the queue for her family. I could see that she was embarrassed. My heart broke for her because she shouldn't be embarrassed. That's not her fault. The circumstances that she's in and what she's been driven to do to feed her family are not her fault at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One provider has explained their level of shock at the number of people needing support. One recipient was a university lecturer who has gone through her savings and is unable to find employment. Another told me about schools. There's a school—and I won't name the school—where they provide a fruit bowl for the students. What has shocked them most is how quickly it empties—almost instantaneously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians shouldn't be wanting for fresh food or healthy food. I hear many families saying that they feel shame and parents saying, 'I feel like I am letting my family down.' The truth is you are not letting your family down. So I want to thank the food banks in my community, and we in this place, on all sides, need to do better to support you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Fee-free TAFE is changing lives and creating invaluable opportunities, particularly for young people seeking new skills and for small-business owners in need of a skilled workforce. The Albanese Labor government understands this, and it's why we delivered 350,000 fee-free TAFE places last year, far exceeding our initial promise of 180,000 places. This take-up shows, with the right incentives, we can build a qualified, skilful workforce in sectors where we need it and provide a pathway to rewarding work opportunities while supporting small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, I introduced the Prime Minister to some of our local fee-free TAFE graduates and students when he visited the Bellarine Peninsula in my electorate. As the graduates shared their success stories, it was impossible not to sense the joy and pride that comes with gaining skills and the ability to confidently earn a decent wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One local graduate, Kaylee, who completed her traineeship with VFA Learning, shared her story, detailing how fee-free TAFE had helped her transition to a new career as a teacher. Kaylee said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I wanted to be in schools since I was young, and [Fee-Free TAFE] was a pathway to [the] teaching career I've always wanted. Now, I am working at a brand-new secondary school which just opened this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what fee-free TAFE is all about. We're building a strong foundation for our education system to thrive and, at the same time, we're creating a better future for more Australians and growing the skills base our businesses desperately need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone who understands that is Flying Brick Cider Co director Lyndsay Sharp. Lyndsay spoke with the Prime Minister and I during our visit about the benefits of fee-free TAFE for local businesses, including those in the hospitality sector. Lyndsay said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Fee-Free TAFE provides the opportunity for people to discover and enter a new industry or for those in their chosen industry to enhance their capabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Lyndsay and her staff at the Flying Brick. This is an awesome local business, and I'd encourage anyone visiting my electorate to drop by the Flying Brick. I know the Prime Minister greatly enjoyed his time with you all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, our government understands a high-performing VET sector is essential not only to create meaningful and secure career opportunities but to deliver the skills our economy needs. Only an Albanese Labor government understands the power of our VET sector as an economic driver and a creator of a skilled workforce.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  I rise this afternoon to raise my serious concerns about what's happening to the health system in Victoria, and I raise this because my local communities are raising it with me. They are deeply, deeply concerned about forced board amalgamations and cuts to health. In particular, the healthcare services at Timboon, Apollo Bay and Lorne are deeply worried that the joint services that they run, those services which are funded by the federal government and by the Victorian state government, are going to see forced amalgamations and cuts to their services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I have written to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, and I've written to the Minister for Aged Care, Anika Wells, asking them two things: please rule out cuts to any funding and, from a federal government point of view for these jointly funded services, please rule out any forced board amalgamations. We do not want to have our healthcare services dictated to us by an entity in Geelong. We want local community boards which know and understand the local community making sure we're delivering those healthcare services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other concern—and this is a major concern—is with regard to ambulance services and the support that we need to provide to our paramedics. In my local community, that of the Southern Grampians in Hamilton, I've had the local paramedics come and see me because they are deeply concerned about the pressures being placed on them and their resources. What is occurring at the moment is that, for 13 hours, over the period of the night, there is only one service available from Hamilton to look after the whole Southern Grampians area. If there is a second fatality or a second need for our paramedics to go to an incident, sadly there is no crew for 13 hours throughout the night. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've launched a petition to say to the Victorian state government that this is clearly not good enough. We need to be able to provide the resources to support a second crew, so that we can ensure that those community members can be provided with assistance when they're in need of that important work that our paramedics offer. We have to make sure that that resourcing is there. Please, everyone in the Southern Grampians Shire, sign that petition and make sure we send a clear message to the Victorian state government. Support our paramedics.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  Bowel cancer is on the rise and is Australia's second-deadliest cancer. Sadly, it claimed my father. It claims the lives of more than 5,350 Australians each and every year. Whilst the risk of bowel cancer increases significantly with age, it does not discriminate, and, indeed, we're seeing it in younger people all the time. In fact, it is considered the deadliest cancer for Australians aged 25 to 44.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the pleasure of having a meeting with a young woman in my electorate, a constituent, who was diagnosed with early onset bowel cancer at just 28 years of age. She was remarkable, she was brave, and she shared her lived experience with me about her early onset bowel cancer and the incredible work that she is now doing to raise awareness, especially amongst younger Australians. This superfit and healthy youth worker knew something was wrong, but it took her six trips to emergency before she started the journey to a diagnosis. I heard how young Australians with bowel cancer symptoms find themselves needing to battle the age bias when it comes to getting a diagnosis. Given it's one of the most treatable forms of cancer when detected early, her work in raising awareness amongst younger Australians is particularly important. Youthfulness should not be a barrier to getting a timely diagnosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vanessa, along with 49 Australians impacted by early onset bowel cancer, visited Canberra last month as part of Bowel Cancer Australia's annual Call on Canberra event. June also marked Bowel Cancer Awareness Month, and 19 June was also Red Apple Day, the day that I managed to meet Vanessa. It is Bowel Cancer Australia's annual giving day. I was really pleased to hear the announcement by Minister Butler, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, that in the 2024-25 budget we are lowering the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program commencement age from 50 to 45. This change was implemented on 1 July and allows 45- to 49-year-olds to opt in to the program by requesting a testing kit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it's not pretty. These kits come in the mail, and you have to go and do them. I'd encourage every Australian who gets the kit in the mail to go and do this test. It's important and it saves lives. Importantly, our budget also included $38 million to ensure that people who receive a positive screening result will be contacted to encourage appropriate follow-up—again, critical if you get that test. The government will continue to work with Cancer Council Australia on a $9 million campaign to encourage Australians to complete their bowel screening test kit. Thank you to Vanessa and thank you to all those Australians who are continuing to raise awareness about this dreadful disease.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  It's great to be able to make a contribution to the debate on this topic. Australia is fortunate to be a place of remarkable biodiversity, and we are all fortunate to have the stewardship of one of the seven continents on earth, which includes the terrestrial environmental condition and all those ecosystems and the biodiversity that flows from that but also a remarkable marine estate. There's no way that you can take proper responsibility and stewardship for that environmental condition of biodiversity that depends upon it if you're not part of environmental collaborative and cooperative action, because clearly the kinds of factors that influence the environment and the health of our environment don't stop at national borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've always understood this. It's been a feature of the work of Labor governments for a long period of time. I think it was a couple of days ago that we marked a significant anniversary with respect to the work that the Hawke government had done around the Franklin dam. Of course, it was the Hawke government that really led the outcomes around the current Antarctic Treaty, considering that in Australia we don't just take responsibility for our own island and continent nation; we feel a special responsibility for Antarctica as well. This government is going to continue that work. We know that it's in our own interests. We know that it's in keeping with our national character, because we've always been a nation that wants to put our shoulder to the wheel of that larger action and have that larger impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, the fact that our environment has suffered considerable harm over a period of time is well-established. Each and every environment report tells us that story. If we didn't have the environment report, we could look at the Graeme Samuel report that was commissioned by and provided to the former government. It said that Australia's environment is in poor state and is on a trajectory of decline. We can't allow that to continue to be the case. It would be utterly irresponsible. In order to reverse that trend and embark on a nature-positive pathway, we need to address the kinds of things that impact our environment. It is about deforestation and habitat loss and invasive species, but it's also about climate change. Climate change has added to and impacted upon those existing vectors of harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why almost the first thing that the government did was re-engage internationally on the question of cooperative action on climate change. We significantly improved Australia's emissions reduction commitment to 43 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. That was a more than 50 per cent increase, in terms of its ambition, compared to the target that the coalition had set. We legislated that. We recommitted to our participation in the Green Climate Fund, which is the way that developed prosperous countries like Australia ensure that there is support for less developed countries to take action as part of this cooperative effort. We know that it's only through that kind of work together with other nations that we can keep global warming below the kind of level that would have a catastrophic impact on human health and on our environment as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to biodiversity more broadly, we support the '30 by 30' commitment. It was last year that Australia joined with 196 countries in agreeing to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. It's a landmark agreement to stop new extinctions. We have to start by recognising, sadly, that Australia has been a world leader when it comes to mammal extinctions. It's not a title we want to hold, but, if we're not prepared to take concerted action, unfortunately a significant number of threatened and endangered species are likely to go closer to the brink of extinction. We can't allow that to happen, so we joined that agreement. More importantly, we've started taking concrete actions to put that agreement into effect. We've added 40 million hectares of land and sea to the national estate as protected terrestrial and marine terrain. That's a significant difference—40 million hectares of additional protected area as part of that commitment to see 30 per cent of Australia's land territory and 30 per cent of our ocean territory protected by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when it comes to marine territory, we've made significant progress in that direction, because, under the previous Labor government, we introduced the first national marine protected area network. Unfortunately, when the coalition government came to power, they cut the sanctuary areas under that plan by a significant amount. I think 50 per cent was cut for the highest protected areas, as they reduced funding to the environment department by 40 per cent and defunded a number of environmental protection measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we're starting to turn that around. We're doubling the number of Indigenous rangers. We've provided $500 million for environmental work when it comes to saving native species, combating invasive species and seeing ecological condition restored. There's $200 million for the Urban Rivers and Catchments Program. Of course, just in the last couple of weeks of parliament, we've been debating the next stage of the big-picture nature-positive reforms, which will deliver a new independent environmental protection agency. That is a massive reform which has been long argued for and long sought after. We are delivering that as we do the two things that are necessary—the bigger picture, longer lasting systemic reform and the immediate, right here and now, changes that improve environmental condition and prevent Australia's biodiversity from being pushed closer to the brink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of ocean, which is a particular interest of mine and an area that I had some responsibility for in my former role as the Shadow Assistant Minister for the Environment, we have joined the High Ambition Coalition to end plastic pollution. We know that plastic in our oceans is a massive problem. If current trends continue, it's likely that there will be a greater weight of plastic in the ocean than fish by the time we get to 2050. That is a scary proposition. We know that microplastic that is in the ocean and is consumed by marine species ends up in human beings. There are some estimates that suggest that we are effectively consuming a credit card's worth of plastic ourselves every few weeks. Much of that material was never designed to be consumed. Needless to say, it's material that contains colourants, fire retardants and other kinds of chemicals that are carcinogenic in their nature. They're not things that human beings should be consuming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when we don't take care of plastic waste and we allow it to go fugitively into the environment, inevitably that comes back to bite us. That's why we have been active in working with the High Ambition Coalition to end plastic pollution and, equally, making sure that we're undertaking change domestically to improve recycling and to avoid unnecessary plastic use in the first place, with the abolition of lots of different kinds of single-use plastics, which is something that the national government needs to lead but which, of course, the state and territory governments implement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also say that I look forward to the forthcoming conference of the International Whaling Commission. I was very fortunate to go to the last one, which was early in this term in 2022. It was in Slovenia, and I represented the Minister for the Environment and Water at that conference. At that meeting of the IWC, which does vital work in protecting whales and advancing the cause of whale conservation, Nick Gales, a brilliant Australian scientist and conservationist, was elected deputy chair. He has done some great work, and obviously it would be great if he could continue to do that—perhaps in an even more senior role than deputy chair. That is another aspect of Australia's engagement on the international stage in the interests of achieving better environmental outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, if you want to protect the environment, our remarkable biodiversity and the condition of the global environment—particularly around things like climate change—you have to act locally but you have to work cooperatively and collaboratively on the international stage. The Minister for the Environment and Water, the member for Sydney, has said there is no time to waste, and she has certainly wasted no time in resuming Australia's role as an international leader.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House knew that without a serious environmental agenda it would be impossible to establish trust in the Pacific and that without global cooperation all our good intentions on the environment would fall short. We took this vision of an environmental agenda and a renewed relationship with our neighbours to the Australian people at the last election, and we have spent the last two years delivering on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was pleasing to see that our environmental leadership was not lost on Australians or our international friends abroad. In fact, one of the first actions of the Minister for the Environment and Water was to attend the 2022 United Nations Ocean Conference. The minister and this Labor government wanted to send a clear message to the world that Australia was once again accepting our responsibility as a global leader on the environment. We know that one person who welcomed this message was the French President, Emmanuel Macron, when he told the Australian contingent:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You're back … we need you in the Indo-Pacific strategy, and climate and oceans is part of the strategy …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know too that protecting nature is a human rights issue. It is an economic opportunity, and it is also clearly a foreign policy and security issue. Our international environmental leadership was demonstrated from the start of our term, when, immediately upon taking office, our government submitted stronger climate targets to the United Nations. We went on to legislate net zero by 2050, and we passed our safeguard reforms through the parliament. We doubled the rate of renewable projects being approved, and we began the process of getting cheaper, cleaner renewables into our energy grid. This is how we become a renewable energy superpower at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this environmental leadership is already important and becoming increasingly essential to our relationships overseas. For example, climate change and clean energy are now officially the third pillar of our US alliance, and we have signed an official agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, working to protect the environment and share critical information and data.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for the environment also led Australia's delegation to Montreal for the UN Biodiversity Conference. It was here where we campaigned for a new global agreement to protect nature in every country. This campaigning contributed to 196 countries agreeing to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. This is a landmark agreement to stop new extinctions, to halt the spread of invasive species, to restore degraded environments and to protect 30 per cent of the planet's land and sea by 2030. As the Australian Conservation Foundation said afterwards, for the first time in a long time, Australia played a leading role in improving the agreement. It was so pleasing to see Australians, led by the minister for the environment, leading from the front in Montreal and the delegation as a force for ambition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're implementing the ambition demonstrated in Montreal here at home. It's very important in terms of our standing as global leaders in this space. We're delivering on our '30 by 30' commitment, protecting 30 per cent of our land and sea by the end of this decade. I am really proud that, since coming to office, we have added an extra 40 million hectares of land and sea to areas under protection. We're also delivering on our pledge to stop new extinctions in Australia with our stronger national environmental laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we're also setting up a new environmental protection agency, Environment Protection Australia, to enforce those stronger laws on the ground, and with our nature repair market we are bringing new funding to the work of protection and restoration. We're investing more than $500 million to save native species and deal with weeds and feral predators. By adopting targets domestically and updating our national biodiversity strategy, we breathe life into our international agreements and we encourage other countries to follow our lead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our oceans, by their very nature, are global, which is why we must also deal with the third element of our triple planetary crisis by fighting for an ambitious global treaty on plastic pollution. Our neighbours in the Pacific see the terrible impact plastics are having on this region. In the ocean to Australia's north, we are pulling up ghost nets that have drifted into our water. These nets are six miles long and killing turtles, dolphins, sharks and fish. The Minister for the Environment and Water has been exceptionally clear in saying that she wants to see a plastic-pollution-free Pacific in our lifetime—as do I, and I know my constituents in Chisholm want to see that too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year, Australia joined the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, a coalition to end plastic pollution by 2040. We're seeking a treaty with binding international laws which push countries to clean up the pollution that is literally choking our environment. We also want to see producers take responsibility for the plastics that they are generating and to minimise demand for plastics in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm passionate about strong action to address climate change, and I am so pleased to see the leadership from the minister for the environment in taking a stand on the issues that I know matter to so many in our communities. Better action on climate and the environment is one of the reasons I chose to run for parliament. I saw the years of inaction on climate change by those opposite and felt compelled to run and be part of a positive change for our environment. I wanted to be a part of an environment that delivered real action for climate change and on environmental leadership. I wanted to push for this change on behalf of my community.</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying earlier, I wanted to be part of a government that delivered real action on climate change and environmental leadership. I wanted to push for this change within government on behalf of my community because I know my community in Chisholm shares my deep concerns about climate change. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have many local environmental groups who do important work advocating and caring for our beautiful local nature reserves. I've said before in this place that I regularly meet with these groups to discuss both local environmental concerns and their larger concerns about climate change and Australian leadership on matters of the environment and nature. I want to acknowledge these local groups that are making a positive difference for our environment: the Australian Conservation Foundation Community Chisholm, Friends of Damper Creek Conservation Reserve, the KooyongKoot Alliance, Friends of Scotchmans Creek and Valley Reserve, and Baby Boomers for Climate Change Action. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all on a journey here, a journey supporting the Pacific and showing our leadership to the rest of the world while doing the necessary work we need to do at home. Dealing with our triple planetary crisis on climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss is an enormous challenge, but it is a challenge we must take on. We must continue to work every day to protect more of what is precious and restore what is damaged, and I'm really proud to be a part of a government that takes our international environmental leadership seriously. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  Last year, I led a parliamentary delegation to New Caledonia and Fiji. While we were in New Caledonia, we met with the SPC, a cooperative body consisting of 22 Pacific island nations along with Australia, New Zealand, France and the US. We received a briefing on the impact of climate change in the region. Now, we're all aware of the member for Dixon's, the now Leader of the Opposition, comments. He seemed to think water lapping at the doors of Pacific island nations was a joke. I know Senator Wong still hears about this whenever she is in the Pacific. It was not only a cruel comment; it was very impolitic and undiplomatic, and it has set back Australia's international relations in the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Pacific family is very much concerned about rising sea levels. But they also told us about the other impacts of climate change in the region. Traditional fish stocks that used to be situated fairly close to shore are now moving out into deeper water as the seagrass beds that the fish feed on have been dying off closer to the coast because of warmer ocean temperatures. While this might seem like a minor thing, what it means is that fish stocks, a major source of food and income for this island nation, are moving out of New Caledonian waters and into international waters. That means their exclusive economic zone is losing this valuable resource and their fish stocks are being plundered by fishers from other regions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's previous lack of action on climate change, alongside with the opposition leader's scorn for its impact on the Pacific, had very real international repercussions for the country. At the 2022 federal election, Labor promised a fresh approach to leadership and the environment. We said we would do things differently. We would rebuild our international relationships and rebuild respect for our role in the region and in the world. We would listen to our neighbours, and we would work with them to bring peace and prosperity to the region. Vitally, part of that is putting the environment front and centre, back where it belongs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, we recognise that without a serious environmental agenda it would be impossible to establish trust in the Pacific, and without global cooperation all our good intentions on the environment would fall short. That was the vision we took to the last election, and it's what we've been delivering on for the past 26 months. Our changed stance on our role in the region and in the world was noticed and welcomed. French President Emmanuel Macron said: 'You are back. We need you in the Indo-Pacific strategy. And climate and oceans is part of that strategy.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting nature is a human rights issue. It's an economic opportunity. It's also a foreign policy issue and a security issue, as around the world we continue to experience more frequent record-breaking heat waves, more frequent record-breaking floods, more frequent record-breaking storms, more frequent and fiercer bushfires, and Atlantic sea ice at record-breaking lows. This is a crisis demanding leadership abroad and action here at home. That is why, immediately after taking office, our government submitted stronger climate targets to the United Nations, legislating net zero by 2050 and passing our safeguard reforms through the parliament. We have seen a massive increase in renewable projects being approved, because, unlike uncosted, no-detail, fantasy nuclear reactors, international capital sees Australian renewable energy projects as a good investment. This is how we become a renewable energy superpower at home, and it's becoming increasingly essential to our relationships overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change and clean energy are now officially the third pillar of our US alliance. We've signed an official agreement with the US Environmental Protection Agency, working to protect the environment and share critical information and data. We are addressing all three aspects of our triple planetary crisis: climate, pollution and biodiversity loss. We are delivering on our '30 by 30' commitment, protecting 30 per cent of the land and sea by the end of this decade. Since coming to office, we have added an extra 40 million hectares of land and sea to areas under protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also delivering on our pledge to stop new extinctions in Australia with our stronger international environmental laws. We have a new EPA to enforce those stronger laws on the ground and our Nature Repair Market bringing new funding to the work of protection and restoration. There is more than $500 million to save native species and deal with weeds and feral predators. There is work that begins by measuring what matters in our budget, tracking biodiversity loss, land protection, air quality, waste and climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These commitments on 30 by 30 and zero new extinctions are supported by every state and territory. By adopting these targets domestically and updating our national biodiversity strategy, we breathe life into our international agreements and encourage other countries to follow our lead. We have tripled the size of the Macquarie Island Marine Park, adding an area of protection bigger than Germany. In Queensland, we are protecting the Great Barrier Reef, improving water quality, dealing with crown of thorns starfish outbreaks, phasing out dangerous gillnet fishing within the World Heritage area and blocking a coalmine that would have risked polluting the marine park—work that UNESCO acknowledged was making significant progress for the reef; work that stopped the site being listed as in danger.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are driving an international push to protect Antarctica and the Southern Ocean from exploitation, campaigning for a new east Antarctic marine park, which would protect over one million square kilometres of penguin and whale habitat, an area the size of NSW. We are continuing Australia's historic leadership on whale protection, upholding the moratorium on commercial whaling, ensuring the survival of these amazing creatures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also dealing with ocean pollution. Our oceans are, by their nature, global. We're fighting for an ambitious global treaty on plastic pollution. In the ocean to Australia's north we are pulling out ghost nets that have drifted into our water—nets that are six miles long and more—killing turtles, dolphins, sharks and fish. Australia joined the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution. We are seeking a treaty with binding international laws which pushes countries to clean up the pollution that is choking our environment. But we also want producers to take responsibility for the plastics that they are generating and to minimise demand for plastics in the first place. It's the same philosophy we're applying to the circular economy here in Australia, rebuilding new recycling facilities and regulating packaging standards. This is already taking millions of tonnes of waste out of landfill every year. In our region Australia is funding the Pacific Ocean Litter Project, with $16 million to reduce single-use plastics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is backing global action. We are adding ambition to international agreements. We're also giving direct support to countries in our region, helping other countries protect their mangroves and seagrass beds with our Blue Carbon Accelerator Fund. It's reviving thousands of hectares of mangrove forests in Indonesia, the Philippines and Madagascar and aiming to increase mangrove coverage by 20 per cent this decade, which will help fish and birds breed and protect coasts from storm surges. Here at home, we're restoring these vital carbon sinks in Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our international development program is also assisting our neighbours to deal with their environmental challenges across the Indo-Pacific. For example, with our help, Palau is currently building its first utility-scale solar farm and battery storage facility, with all the social benefits that come from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same spirit, we're helping Pacific countries to build their weather monitoring and prediction services, through the Bureau of Meteorology working with local agencies to better forecast their climate's oceans and tides, helping them deal with emergencies and climate change. We're collaborating with our neighbours on other areas of science and research, bringing together reef and ocean managers from across the Pacific, led by the Australian Institute of Marine Science, because, if we share the same problems, we should actively share the solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians live in the most beautiful country in the world. We have a duty to protect our world heritage—those places with outstanding universal value. Our government is investing in that national estate by doubling our funding to national parks like Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu. We're actively extending it by progressing nominations for Murujuga Cultural Landscape, Cape York, the West Kimberley and the Flinders Ranges. We're using this experience to grow our Indigenous world heritage profile, with $5.5 million for First Nations to lead future bids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a shared vision we're supporting in the Pacific and around the world, while doing the necessary work at home on dealing with our triple planetary crisis: climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. We're working every day to protect more of what's precious, restore more of what's damaged and manage nature better for our kids and our grandkids.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I'm pleased to speak today on the ministerial statement on Australia's international environmental leadership—something that I've been very proud of since coming to government in 2022. Here in Australia, we are extremely aware of the impact that the climate crisis is having on our environment. From the horrific Black Summer bushfires we saw in the summer of 2019 to 2020, to the increase in flash flooding across our country, to devastating drought, Australians are increasingly aware of the human and natural impacts of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, more than ever, we must take strong action on climate change and ensure that we are leaving the world a better place for our children and the future. But this also means Australians must be leading the way in environmental protection and climate positive policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2023, Minister Plibersek delivered a statement on Australia's international environment leadership, affirming our government's commitment to this. In that statement, the minister outlined how important it was for Australia to take on the responsibility of protecting and restoring Australia's environment, to ensure we are helping to achieve a stable Indo-Pacific region, a sustainable planet and a safer world based on our environmental action. This is what we promised during the 2022 election, and it's what our government is committed to delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of climate denial and inaction, the Albanese Labor government is shouldering our responsibility as international environment leaders, and we're taking this responsibility extremely seriously. We are not playing games with the environment for the sake of contrarianism and politics, like some opposite have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made tangible steps to protect our environment. When we came to government, we immediately submitted stronger climate targets to the United Nations. We quickly legislated net zero emissions by 2050. We reformed the safeguard mechanism. We doubled the rate of renewable energy projects being approved. We implemented a marine protection framework. In just two years, we have greenlit a record 54 renewable energy projects—enough to power over three million Australian homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are catching Australia up to the rest of the world, after we saw the previous government have a decade of denial and delay. We have also made our international partnerships with the United States and, more broadly, with our allies in the Asia-Pacific based on climate action. Our government has also signed on to several international agreements, committing Australia to taking strong action on climate change and protecting our environment. These include the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, signed in 2022 with 196 other countries, which is a global agreement to stop new extinctions, halt the spread of invasive species, restore degraded environments and protect 30 per cent of the planet's land and sea by 2030. This ambitious agreement is something that the Australian delegation led the charge on—something unheard of in this country before 2022—and we are delivering on this agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we have more work to do. The Albanese Labor government is continuing to make progress, to ensure that we are at the forefront of environmental policies and climate action. We are still working to be the leaders on that front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, we are debating the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill, the Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill and the Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill. These bills are setting up Australia's first national environmental protection agency, which will have strong powers and penalties to enforce federal environmental laws and ensure that the EPA is ready to administer our new environmental laws that are currently under consultation. These bills are also legislating Environment Information Australia, which is an independent agency that has a mandate to provide environmental data and information to the EPA, the minister and the public. Ultimately, they are the next step in the minister's Nature Positive Plan and they complement the ongoing work of the minister to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act according to the Samuel review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also investing in a future made in Australia, to capitalise on Australia's capacity to become a renewable-energy powerhouse. This is beneficial for our nation but also for our international partners. We have lots of sun and wind here. We have a natural advantage in this area, and we plan to make the most of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key way is showing environmental leadership is through addressing pollution, particularly of the ocean. The ocean, of course, does not belong just to one nation. Australia has always been famous for our beautiful beaches. While we may only have Acton Beach here in Canberra, Australia's coastline is iconic and Canberrans certainly love our South Coast. But imagine if that coastline were covered in plastic and other rubbish. This is something that our Pacific allies know far too well. We know that plastic pollution is having devastating effects on our marine life and ecosystems. A plastic-free Pacific is something that we can achieve in our lifetimes. In 2022, Australia joined the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution. It aims to end plastic pollution by 2040. Also in our region we are funding the Pacific Ocean Litter Project, with $16 million to reduce single-use plastics. We are also building new recycling facilities and regulating packaging standards, which is lowering the amount going into landfill. As the minister put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting nature is a human rights issue. It's an economic opportunity. It's also a foreign policy issue. It's a security issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that we are in a climate crisis and action must be taken. I am proud to be part of a government that is taking that strong action that we need on climate change. I am also proud to represent a community that is deeply engaged on environmental and climate issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I and other members of the class of 2019 were first elected, one of the very first experiences that many of us had was of the bushfires and the response to those. While we didn't have the fires here in Canberra, they were obviously in the region and in many places that Canberrans love and have connections to, particularly on the South Coast of New South Wales. But also, here in Canberra, where we normally have very good air-quality, for much of that January of 2020 we had some of the worst air quality in the world, to the point that our city was locked down many times, lots of public buildings were closed and people were advised to stay in their homes and to have air conditioning on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who had an existing health condition, pregnant women or anyone with particular vulnerabilities was advised that they should be relocating, which, of course, wasn't an option for so many people. Similarly, staying at home with the air conditioning on wasn't an option for so many people, particularly people living on social security, people who couldn't afford air conditioning and didn't have it. As a relatively new local member, I was confronted with people asking for my help with those issues, and I think it really brought home to me and to all of us how unprepared we were for those very real impacts of climate change that we were already seeing. This is not something off into the future but something we are already seeing around us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so critically important that the action we are delivering is the most ambitious that it can be and that we are doing the most that we can do to confront this global challenge. I am incredibly proud that our government is doing just that: that we have set ambitious targets—not just ambitious targets for the sake of that but ones that we know we can get to, that we have a plan to actually deliver. It is also disingenuous to say that we can turn this around tomorrow; we can't. This will be the biggest transformation that our economy has ever seen, and it is one for which we are up for the challenge. We want Australia to make the most of the opportunities. That's what our Future Made in Australia plan is about as well. It is about capitalising on the fact that we have natural advantages for renewable energy and we should be building those things here as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On coming into government, I remember it was said that under Labor the environment is back. That has been so incredibly important. The bills I mentioned earlier that we are debating this week include enshrining in legislation the principle of being nature positive, which is not just a slogan; it is about leaving the environment in a better state than we found it and about fixing some of the terrible problems with Australia's environment right now. It is something our government is deeply committed to, as is my community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  This is an important statement for talking about Australia's international obligations in the environment space. I note that, in the nine years we were in government, we had rooftop solar on one in four houses. That was world's best. That was world's best practice. A lot is often said condemning what the coalition did or didn't do during our three terms in office, but rest assured that there was money for such vital environmental projects that Landcare did right throughout the country. We made huge investments in ensuring that our waterways were as they should be. There were huge investments and consideration for the soil.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the member for Paterson, I am very pleased to be the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Soil, because what we can do as a nation in being good environmental stewards dealing with climate action is right beneath our feet. What we should be doing more of is making sure that there's carbon sequestration. We should be making sure that the soil we have is healthy and protected, because, if we don't, that is going to lead to more soil degradation and more soil salinity. You would know that yourself, Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, coming from Lingiari, that massive electorate in the Northern Territory. I know that, right throughout the nation, our soil needs to be preserved and protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note too that, in her 15 November 2023 statement on international environmental leadership, the Minister for the Environment and Water talked about Labor promising a fresh approach to leadership and the environment and mentioned, in only the third sentence in that particular statement, that Labor was renewing Australia's relationships abroad, particularly in the Pacific, establishing trust in the Pacific. There was always trust in the Pacific. It annoys me that this rubbish is perpetuated by those opposite saying that we never looked after or we ignored the Pacific. The Pacific is our neighbourhood. It's our environment. We have been very good friends with our Pacific friends, no less so than through the former foreign affairs minister Senator Marise Payne, who did a power of good, a power of work, in the Pacific to ensure that those links, which stretch back many, many decades, were continued, built upon and enhanced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of the Pacific, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch—you can also call it the Pacific trash vortex or the North Pacific garbage patch, whatever you like—is an alarming concern. It is indeed growing. The Ocean Cleanup projects researchers claim that the patch covers 1.6 million square kilometres. That is massive—three times the size of France, I think. It includes many items of plastic. To address climate, we have this folly in this nation that we're going to close down every coalmine and every coal-fired power station tomorrow. I see the member for Hunter opposite. That would destroy the communities in his electorate. We have this rush towards renewables, this linear approach towards getting to net zero by 2050, which is dictating that Labor needs to outgreen the Greens political party at times. There is great folly in this. If those opposite truly believe that we are going to have worse weather, more severe droughts, more severe flooding and more severe weather events having an impact on our environment, on our communities and on insurance premiums, then why the rush to renewables, where Labor is going to rely on the weather—on wind and all of those things, hydroelectricity et cetera—to power our nation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If, as the member for Boothby said, Labor wants a future made in Australia, with manufacturing in Australia, producing goods made right here and not necessarily relying on those that come from abroad, then we're going to have to have good, reliable, available, affordable power supplies. That energy can't just come from solar and wind, because, as has often been stated—and it is decried by those opposite—when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, the battery storage capacity and the technology are just not at that point at the moment. They may well be in the future, but they are not right here right now. That is why we need to have a mix. That is why we need to have a balance. And that is why I and the coalition members believe that we need to have a national, rational discussion about the possibility of having nuclear in that mix, because to get to net zero by 2050, like so many other nations in the world and so many other progressive economic leaders in the world, we need to have nuclear as part of the energy mix and not rely solely or too heavily on wind, solar and renewables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficulty that we face as local communities—and all politics is local—is that, particularly up in northern New South Wales and other parts of the nation that I have visited, we are running out of room for our rubbish tips. We are running out of room. We are such a consumer driven society. You buy a shirt these days and unpack it, and you've got any number of pins and cardboard and plastic. The plastic surrounding it weighs even more than the actual product itself. You buy a three-pack of soap these days, and each cake of soap is contained in its own box within a box. This is all leading to more and more landfill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are we doing to address that? I have to pay credit to the former environment minister the member for Farrer, Sussan Ley. She did a lot of work in this space to ensure that we were addressing these sorts of issues. But we do need to have not a war on plastic but careful consideration of what we do in this space so that we are not just making more and more landfill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can well remember going to Nairobi, in Kenya, not that long ago. They had a rubbish dump there which was started in the late eighties or early nineties and which had filled up by the early 2000s and was closed, but they continued to deliver rubbish there. Sadly, thousands upon thousands of women, particularly young girls and women, went there each day and picked through the rubbish that was collected there. You can see this rubbish dump from outer space; that is how large it is. We don't want a repeat of that anywhere in the world. I know that Kenya as a nation is doing its utmost and level best to address its plastic problem—you're not allowed to take plastic bags into the country and, if you get caught at customs or the borders bringing in a plastic bag, even to put your clothes in within your luggage or whatever the case might be, you cop a fine. That's probably a good thing given the problem they have at the Nairobi rubbish dump.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, to my point about local councils, they are running out of room for their landfills. We as a parliament and, indeed, also state governments need to address this problem because we need to have better recycling. We need to encourage more recycling. We throw out so many materials—bottles and plastics—that could easily be recycled. Whether there's the room and the political will to incentivise that process remains to be seen. But this is an important statement. I appreciate that the government will always say it's doing better than what we ever did. That is truly not the case, but we don't need the Greens in a power-sharing arrangement in any future government to lead us all down an environmental path which would be very bad for business and very bad for household budgets.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I've previously used my time in this place to discuss inequities in relation to women's health and, in particular, the intersectional health inequities for women who live in the regions. Women who live in the regions have drawn the short straw, particularly in remote Australia. Underfunding of women's health is not just occurring here in Australia; it's observed internationally. In the US, reported reimbursement for obstetric care is low in comparison to other services. As in the US, the undervaluing and resulting poor reimbursement for women's health means private hospitals have less interest and, as a result, we see, for example, private maternity units closing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doctors in my electorate also tell me that women in regional Australia are suffering because, whether it be for birthing, pelvic pain or prolapse, there are not enough specialists, expert nurses or allied health professionals to care for women in the regions. This means women travel long distances away from their family, paying for accommodation, just to be able to access birthing support. They are often without their partner. It's fair to say the audit of gender inequity in aspects of Medicare announced in the 2024-25 budget is overdue and welcome; however, solutions will need to be identified and implemented properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has said that the audit 'misses the bigger picture' as it overlooks GPs as the major providers of health care for women. The college has also expressed that Medicare lacks item numbers or provides very low rebate loadings for complex women's healthcare services provided by GPs, including the support of women going through menopause, chronic pain or endometriosis. These are health issues which medical professionals are still building their knowledge and capacity on, and they're not addressed in a short and simple consultation. I suggest the audit also needs to consider the interactions of multiple inequities which impact the health of those women who live in regional, rural and remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of areas where we can see women's health inequity at play. Let's look at endometriosis. One in seven women live with endometriosis. The average waiting time for a diagnosis after experiencing initial symptoms is a staggering eight years. Many women's symptoms are not taken seriously. They're told to go home and just have panadol. If they do get to see a doctor who is aware of endometriosis, there is a long wait for a laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. Indeed, one of my constituents was sadly left with no alternative but to have a very early hysterectomy due to a too-late diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. It needs to be caught early, and treatment needs to happen early.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reportedly, work is being done overseas on development of a simple urine test which would allow GPs to administer a diagnostic kit. It would take days instead of years to detect endometriosis. The government's endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics are welcome. However, I note the additional new clinic announced in Adelaide was a pre-existing clinic at which waiting lists blew out shortly after it was rebadged under the national program in September last year. The only other place in South Australia is Kadina, which is hours away from where the majority of South Australians live. A shiny new announcement doesn't hugely increase the number of women who are able to get the diagnosis and treatment that they need in a reasonable timeframe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On objective measures, waiting-time figures for gynaecology-specialist outpatient clinics published quarterly by the South Australian health department, known as SA Health, show there was very little change in the average wait times for these outpatient services, which cover endometriosis and pelvic pain, since 2022. Even after those new clinics were announced between September and December, which are the most recent figures we have, average wait times for two major metropolitan hospitals—those being the Lyell McEwin Hospital and the Flinders Medical Centre—remain at 15 and 10 months, respectively. The maximum wait time at Flinders Medical Centre for these patients remained at 44 months and, in the case of the Lyell McEwin Hospital, grew from 41 to 44 months. That is an incredibly long period of time to have an outpatient appointment, particularly when the pain is so significant for women experiencing endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about the out-of-pocket costs of cancer. Nobody dealing with cancer should have to participate in a postcode and financial lottery, in terms of accessing the best care that they can. I have a constituent—her name is Bronwyn—and she has been sharing with me her journey of living with cancer and requiring out-of-hospital radiotherapy and other treatments. She told me about the prohibitive cost of many treatments which are not covered by expensive private health insurance. I would like to quote Bronwyn. She says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The costs of cancer are huge. We pay high premiums for private health insurance and then to be told that it is not a requirement that the private health companies pay the medicare gap for radiotherapy is such a let down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In a time when you are going through cancer treatment, adding the financial stress makes it worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Add to this the process and fight that you have to do to even get to be heard is really tiring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She continues later to describe the ongoing cost of cancer related lymphoedema treatment, physiotherapy, compression garments and even bone-density infusions. She says, 'The costs of cancer continue to be expensive,' and that this all:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… highlights the cost of cancer at every stage—financial, emotional, time away from family and work. It's such a tiring, exhausting battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to talk about breast cancer MRIs. I wrote to the Minister for Health and Aged Care in February this year to share concerns raised with me by several of my constituents regarding the access to and affordability of Medicare magnetic resonance imaging, MRIs, for breast cancer detection. Women who have denser breasts are at increased risk of having breast cancer. The density can obscure cancer when they have a mammogram, so many women opt to have an MRI, and their doctors tell them to do so. Medicare items cover MRIs for many parts of the body, but only in very limited circumstances are Medicare subsidies available for MRI breast scans, such as for people aged under 60 but with specific high-risk criteria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Strathalbyn constituent of mine who survived breast cancer and has a strong familial history of it has told me that her first cancer would not have been detected, due to her breast density, if she had been relying on a mammogram alone. She credits her access to a Medicare-subsidised MRI scan before she turned 50 as the reason she is alive today. Even if medical professionals recommend MRI breast scans due to breast density, there is no Medicare subsidy available for this procedure based on breast density alone. Add in limited facilities in regional locations, and it is a real challenge for many women to gain access. This leaves many women—usually, but not always, women suffering from breast cancer—paying up to $400 for a scan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this is coupled with high transport costs from places like, for example, in my electorate, Kangaroo Island, which is very remote, it is problematic, and so often women just stop getting those diagnostic tests. Further, growing out-of-pocket costs for services not subsidised by Medicare and not covered under private health insurance are not sustainable, particularly for vulnerable people on a low income or those who are unable to work due to having a serious illness. Therefore I asked the minister to investigate better availability of rebates for MRI diagnostic imaging screening if an MRI is recommended by a medical professional as a result of breast density. While the minister pointed out that there were two relevant reviews and projects being undertaken which may have a bearing on these issues, nearly six months later neither the BreastScreen program nor the Breast MRI Evaluation reports have been handed down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a final piece of bad news, in my community one of the state's major radiology providers has announced that it will no longer bulk-bill at its regional clinics unless patients have a concession card. Surely, women—in particular, regional women—have waited long enough for their health conditions to be properly understood and for the gap in health care to be addressed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I rise this evening in this grievance debate to talk about the current state of our national conversation here in Australia and the fact that it seems to be broken. I rise to talk about social cohesion and the tone of the debate at the moment in Australia—in this place and in the community. From the outset, I want to put on record again my support for people to protest, to express their views to their representatives and to participate in our democracy, because, without protest, without views being expressed openly, we lose what makes our system of government so special. When we disagree respectfully, when we can test each other's ideas, that's when the best decisions are made in the interests of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, at the moment, I fear that we are losing some of that. I fear that, in recent months and years, anger is increasing, listening is declining, respect is evaporating. Too often, the facts are not a key feature of discussion. It is reaching a point where debate, both in this chamber and outside of parliament, is reduced to sound bites and clickbait. Genuine positions are twisted and misrepresented. Opposing views are becoming attacks on the very character of the individuals who hold them. Political opponents are being presented as enemies. We in this chamber are not enemies of each other. It's my belief that everyone here genuinely is here because they want what's best for Australians, even if we disagree on how best to achieve that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few days, we've seen the vandalising of war memorials here at the national War Memorial, in my electorate. I just want to condemn that in the absolute strongest terms. These memorials, which I am so proud to have in the electorate that I represent, are there to honour the service and sacrifice of all Australians who have served. They should be treated with the utmost respect, always.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen, in recent days, a teenager arrested for plotting a terrorist attack against MPs. We have seen, even today, terrible vandalism and disruption at electorate offices. What happened to the member for Macnamara's office was absolutely shocking, as was what has happened in the member for Wills's office, and these are just two examples among many. I think these violent actions and disruptive actions do nothing to further the causes of the people that are claiming to represent those causes in doing these things. They do disrupt people's access to their local member, as part of their democratic right to go and see their local member about issues that affect them—be it a Centrelink, NDIS or immigration matter. People are not feeling safe to go and do that. People's offices have been closed, and, as for our staff—electoral staff, who are incredibly hardworking people who care about their communities—they are being put in increasingly dangerous and distressing situations. It needs to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost every MP has been labelled a war criminal or a supporter of genocide. I say, as someone who has been copping that for many months now, it's ridiculous. Our government has been calling for a ceasefire for over six months. Our government is delivering aid to Gaza. Our government has called for Israel to cease attacks on Rafah. I want to say this in the context of the many speeches I have given on this since 7 October and the many speeches I gave on Palestinian rights before that—since I was elected in 2019. I understand the deep distress people are feeling about what's going on. I understand the way people in my community are feeling. I've been listening to them on this issue. But there is a dehumanising of politicians that is happening at the moment, which is not good for the debate at all. It is not helping people to be heard, and it is not encouraging people to want to be politicians and to represent their communities in this place. It is becoming such an ugly game at the moment, with some really serious accusations being thrown around, and the temperature of debate is damaging our social cohesion in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, around the world we've seen violent attacks on MPs. We've even seen people killed. This is not something that we should be blase about. This is not something remote from us in Australia. We can't believe that we are immune from that. We need to be careful about the conversations we are having in this place and the impact that they are having on people in our communities. I would say that every member of this House and the other place and many involved in state or territory politics have experienced real and physical threats to their safety or incredibly confronting emails and conversations with people. It is not doing anything to further causes. As I say, too often the facts have gone missing in these discussions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This being a grievance debate, I have been reflecting on a few things and I want, as part of this, to bring together a few reflections I've had. One is about an amazing event that I had the great honour to MC on Sunday night, which was a fundraiser for one of our Labor candidates for the ACT assembly seat of Murrumbidgee, Noor El-Asadi—a wonderful candidate and an inspirational woman—and I was there with my amazing colleagues from the federal party: the Deputy Speaker the member for Lingiari; the member for Holt; and, also, the member for Swan. These four women are inspirational not just to me but to young women everywhere. Each of them brought such an incredible story that we had the chance to hear that night. I feel that this is something that is lost when we are all just diminished to people who are presented as not caring, as not listening or as not having human reactions to things that we are hearing in the community and seeing unfold around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another event I want to reflect on. I recently attended a documentary screening of a film about a constituent of mine, Dr Nilofar Ebrahimi, who is an obstetrician-gynaecologist and former member of the Afghanistan parliament. Subsequently she has come to Canberra seeking refuge here following the Taliban takeover. This documentary was one of the most moving things I have ever seen. People were sitting there crying, watching her story and that of a groundbreaking journalist in Afghanistan, Shakila Ibrahaimkhel, because they were women and doing these things as women for the first time. It really brought home the struggles that people have for democracy and equality. One of the most moving parts of this was where Nilofar said: 'I was the first in my community to be a doctor. I was the first to be a politician.' Another part was where, after you see her struggles, her separation from her family and her fears for the safety of her young children, she said, 'If I wasn't a real representative, why would I do this stuff?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, the message is that we cannot forget the women and girls of Afghanistan, who have now gone for over 1,000 days without access to education. That is something that Nilofar's organisation she runs here in Canberra, the ZamZam Foundation, does to support them. I think it's important that we all just take a moment to think about what people in this place are trying to achieve. We are listening, we are people and we feel the same things that people in the community feel. We should all, including in this place, take the temperature down on debate and work together for a peaceful democracy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I rise tonight to address a matter of great significance for the people of Far North Queensland, the proposed UNESCO World Heritage listing of the Cape York Peninsula region. Queensland state and federal Labor governments have recently progressed the proposal, and I, along with many others, have great reservations about what might occur if they succeed in securing a World Heritage listing. Cape York is undeniably a treasure, rich in biodiversity and cultural heritage. It is a landscape that demands respect and careful stewardship. It is a picturesque, wild country. Many Australians view it as a rite of passage to traverse the very tip of the northern point of the Australian continent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the cape certainly warrants protection, the approach proposed by the government to enlist this region under the auspices of UNESCO is not only flawed but potentially detrimental to the communities that call it home. Firstly, consider the implication of this proposal on the rights and livelihoods of the traditional owners and the local residents. For decades Indigenous communities have fought tirelessly to reclaim and secure land rights. These efforts and struggles are now being undermined. Both state and federal Labor governments have effectively sidelined these communities in favour of an international body. They are ignoring their voices—from what I understand—arguably misleading them and diminishing their control on their ancestral lands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal threatens to transform vast areas of the cape into zones primarily reserved for tourism. This might be fine for some areas, but it will undoubtedly restrict essential activities such as agriculture, development and mining, which many locals depend on for their livelihoods. The economic repercussions of such a limitation could be devastating, particularly for a region that thrives on the sustainable use of its natural resources. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also remember that this proposal effectively hands over the judgement of these lands and its protection to a committee populated by representatives from countries far removed from us and our reality such as Bulgaria, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Turkiye and Zambia, just to name a few. These nations do not share our direct connection to the land, nor do they fully understand the complexities and challenges unique to Cape York.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen previously with the Great Barrier Reef that the World Heritage Committee and its decision-making is a highly politicised international horse-trading session. I saw this for myself firsthand when I was the Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. World Heritage committee members inevitably come to these assessment processes with preconceived notions about the state and status of World Heritage listings, and the government of the day and their bureaucrats are often at pains to try and illustrate the reality of the situation on the ground or in the water, as it were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I and many others I've spoken with just can't see the benefit of the listing outweighing the costs and restrictions to landholders and traditional owners groups that will inevitably come. The government has said it will consult widely, as it should. But it worries me that the proposal echoes the misguided conservation efforts of the past such as those initiated under the Wayne Goss Labor government, which sought to impose wilderness protection zones that restricted access to the usage of vast areas of Cape York. It was this act of overreach that helped compel me to enter politics back in 1995. This push for a World Heritage listing is effectively a revival of the longstanding agenda by Labor to lock up our lands under the guise of conservation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not convinced that the government's efforts to engage and consult with the local communities are sufficient. Many have expressed concerns to me directly. The government hasn't even bothered to extend their consultations to the local Cook Shire Council, the Weipa Town Authority and other local authorities. In my view, the engagement to date is sorely lacking in that the forthright disclosure and explanation of the potential ramifications of World Heritage listing is merely a footnote in these discussions. The current consultation process is being criticised by prominent traditional owners for being too selective and insufficient in scope, for lacking transparency, and for its failure to include all stakeholders. This has already lead to significant apprehension about the World Heritage listing process and the government's mandate to pursue this in the first place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to those concerns, I will be initiating a petition in the coming days. This petition will call for action from every member of our community who believes in Cape York's right to self-determination, local governance and the rights of our Indigenous people and their land. I believe the people of Cape York do not need international entities dictating how they should manage their local environmental and cultural heritage. The stewardship of Cape York should be characterised by inclusivity and respect for all voices, not just those the government or UNESCO have received a warm reception from. The people of this region are diverse and so are their views and aspirations. The government needs to consider these facts very carefully. We must work towards a commitment to sustainable development that will benefit all residents. Our goal must be to protect our environment while ensuring that the community thrives economically and culturally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who are in favour of the proposal, particularly certain traditional owner groups, please seriously consider the ramifications to your land and to your neighbours and what they are able to do with their land. The implications are very serious, and the impacts on all residents will no doubt be quite profound. It would be a tragic outcome for those in Cape York if the government pursued this listing under false pretence and without full, unequivocal and informed consent and support from all communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigenous people throughout Cape York have fought long and hard for their land rights and for the ability to be able to pursue economic activity on their land. There are entire communities in Cape York that are built upon activities that UNESCO will certainly disapprove of. I think it's rather ironic that, after all of these years in seeking to get native title rights—and we always talk about the cultural appropriateness of them managing their own country and the environmental benefits of traditional owners owning their own, or managing their own, country—we now have a situation where we're saying, 'Righto, now that you've got that country, we want to take that and hand the decision-making in relation to the management, both culturally and environmentally, over to a group of faceless individuals, an international committee.' It seriously doesn't make sense. Many of the traditional owners that I talk to are very, very concerned about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also a concern for the neighbours of these areas. Some of the traditional owners say, 'We want to lock this up in environmental management,' and that's not an issue. They should be the ones best equipped to manage their country, and they're able to do that, but there are also concerns about the ramifications for all of those neighbours. Not everybody wants to be photo fodder for tourists, standing naked on one leg in a water lily pond with a spear for tourists to take a photograph when they come by. Others have other aspirations for themselves and their families, and they should have the right to pursue those. To lock them into a particular economic situation is, I think, totally appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't stress the significance of this issue enough. I'm strongly encouraging any and all residents of Cape York with the slightest reservations to get involved in the process. As I said earlier, I'll be initiating a petition shortly. Please join me in opposing this misguided proposal for World Heritage listing. We should let Cape York people and Cape York landholders determine for themselves what is best for their community and their land. We simply cannot leave this important decision to people thousands of miles away who have no idea whatsoever where Cape York even is, let alone what the diversity and the cultural significance of that land is. I think we should leave it to Cape York people to do their own management of their own country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I am aggrieved at the confected outrage, the absurd criticism and the mindless negativity we see from those opposite towards the Albanese Labor government. They like to carp and moan and accuse the government of creating the inflationary and cost-of-living pressures that the community is currently facing. The reality is that the coalition has very little credibility in terms of economic management both in government and in opposition. Firstly, when they were in government, the coalition did nothing to contain inflation. They racked up big deficits and even bigger debt. They did nothing for the cost of living. They didn't bank savings when it came to budgetary and fiscal management. On dealing with the underlying issues of the economy, they did almost nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When governments lose and people go to opposition, it's quite common for them to talk about the good things they did in government. You almost never hear the opposition members talk about the good things they did in government. It was simply nine years of wasted opportunity. 'Everything is now too hard,' they thought when they were in government. It was someone else's responsibility. It was the responsibility of the states or of someone else. In the climate wars we had 22 energy policies from those opposite. The NEG didn't even last until question time, from the time it was announced in the morning. They couldn't land anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it came to housing and homelessness it was always the responsibility of the states, even when it came to veterans' homelessness and housing issues. There was the rising cost of our health care, university and TAFE. Who can forget the $50 billion in cuts to health and the $30 billion in cuts to education in the first Abbott government budget in 2014? On the rising costs of child care, university and TAFE, the coalition government were completely missing in action, saying 'Just leave it to the market,' 'We'll make cuts,' and having that commission of audit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Simply nothing was done with skills agreements with states and territories. It took the member for Gorton to come in as the responsible minister to achieve that. On industry policy and boosting sovereign capacity and supply chain resilience, you'd think that after COVID they'd have done something about it, but they did nothing about it. This was a government that practically goaded the car industry to leave and destroyed a large part of our manufacturing bases. I can remember when the car industry left Australia. People involved in the supply chain for the car industry were as far as Kilcoy in my electorate, but they lost their capacity to engage with the car industry when the car industry left. Those nine years were a wasted time. They had great opportunity. They came in with a huge majority in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were elected on a platform of getting things done. It was a platform that wanted to address the range of problems in the community that the coalition had neglected and ignored for many years. When we were in opposition, we were critical of the then government. There were times when we took a bipartisan approach on serious issues. But we see now from those opposite the culture wars, nasty negativity and divisive wedge politics. When push comes to shove, I think we've got to work in the national interest. On this side we know there are a lot of people in our community who are doing it tough. I know that from the mobile offices that I've been doing, particularly in country areas. Last Saturday, I was at Rosewood Shire to talk to people who have been doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: it would be a lot worse if those opposite were in power now. Let me talk about the fact that, on 1 July, just yesterday, we saw a situation where we had tax cuts come in for 80,000 people in my electorate, with 90 per cent of those people getting more than they would have under the coalition. The average tax cut in my electorate is $1,380 a year, $26 a week. There was the $300 energy bill relief that those opposite have never supported; in fact, they opposed energy bill relief when we brought it in just over a year or so ago. There's $325 to eligible small businesses on top of the $1,000 government that the Miles Labor government is doing in Queensland. That is $1,300 off electricity bills. These things are important—absolutely critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the HELP debt change in indexation, through which 23,000 people in my electorate will benefit. Commonwealth rent assistance increasing by 10 per cent after 15 per cent the time before—those opposite did not do anything about that at all in the nine years. We're giving a helping hand to 12,000 households in my electorate. There are tax cuts, energy bill relief, cheaper medicine and pay rises for 2.6 million Australians. Those opposite could not even bring themselves to support an increase in the minimum wage. In fact, their finance spokesperson, Mathias Cormann, talked about keeping wages down as a design feature of their economic policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They can come up with the idea that in 2040 they'll have some nuclear reactors at a much higher cost for energy. It's a harebrained initiative. It really is a ridiculous initiative. I can't believe it's a policy. Look at the statement they issued. A party that wants to be in government issued a press statement with no costings and no details saying where they're going to get the money. They talk about being a party of free enterprise, but they want a big socialist, nationalised nuclear industry in this country. It's quite astonishing that the Liberals and Nationals have fallen that far away from their historical roots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure we help people who are doing it tough, and that's why we're going to make a difference with what we have done. We've rolled out cost-of-living relief. We've done it before and we're doing it again. Those opposite cannot bring themselves even to talk about the tax cuts. Why? Because, when given the opportunity to reduce taxation for people earning less than $45,000, they did not do anything in relation to that issue. In fact, at first, they wanted to oppose it. They opposed it with all their might. Then they wanted to roll it back, and then they squibbed it. Even recently you hear these little mutterings from those opposite about having their own tax policy, going forward—until the CEDA conference, when the Leader of the Opposition had to concede that basically they're not going to do anything about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're proud of the changes we made. They were fairer. People like me got half the tax benefit that I would have got, but people below $45,000 a year got an increase in benefit. We're proud of those changes because they fundamentally made the tax cuts fairer. That's genuine tax relief lifting thresholds, cutting tax rates, getting average tax rates down and returning bracket creep all at the same time. It means that, on average, people across the country are $36 a week better off. If you're talking about an average household with a couple of kids, it's $63 a week. If you're on $120,000 a year, you're $52 a week better off. If you're on $100,000 a year, you're $42 a week better off. If you're on $80,000 a year, you're $32 a week better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the thing: under stage 3 tax cuts, those opposite denied the opportunity for those low-income earners to get a tax cut. They abandoned people on $45,000 a year, so this is important. Over 10 years, every year the average tax rate for the average worker will be lower under Labor's plan than Scott Morrison's plan. If the people in opposition had had their way, some taxpayers would have missed out. The deputy leader was so enraged as I made that point before. They went: 'Roll back! Roll back!' We've got a bit of advice for you. We tried to roll back the GST. It didn't work. So the idea of rolling back the tax cuts was a really silly idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been putting downward pressure on inflation. Inflation is much lower now than it was when those opposite were there. It's got a four in front. It was 6.1 per cent when those opposite were last in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, wages have grown at almost double the rate of our predecessors. We've overseen the creation of 880,000 jobs. That's a record for any first-term government. We've supported back-to-back increases in the minimum wage, and we've delivered a historic and long-overdue 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers. They were some of the heroes in the pandemic. From this week onwards, 2.6 million Australian workers on award wages will get another pay rise. Because we want people to earn more and keep more of what they earn, under our government there will be a pay rise for millions of workers on awards. Those opposite could not bring themselves once in nine years in government to support an increase in the minimum wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have frozen the cost of PBS medicines on top of delivering cheaper medicines. Remember the move to 60-day dispensing. Those opposite said that it would lead to pharmacies being shut around the country. I can tell you that no pharmacies have shut in my electorate at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we've added an extra two weeks of paid parental leave, something those opposite could never have provided or even contemplated. In addition to that, workers earning more and keeping more also get a top up in their superannuation from 1 July. This is really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have a policy in terms of housing that doesn't support national issues at a federal level. They want to take superannuation out of people's hands and put it into housing. They haven't got a policy for housing. All they've got is a policy to oppose housing initiatives at a federal level.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I'd like to touch on a few things this evening that are of concern to me. I might just comment on the member for Canberra's contribution a little while ago. It was quite a thoughtful contribution, and I'd just like to add to it. With the current debate in this country and the actions of people around the issues in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, it's of great concern to me that this country is tearing itself apart, moving into tribes and almost supporting different sides of this conflict like it were some sort of a football competition when we're seeing absolute death and destruction on a daily basis: the original attack by Hamas that killed so many innocent people, and the 40,000 Palestinians that have lost their lives since then. In this country, we're tearing ourselves apart, and it's not making one bit of difference to those people in the Middle East. Whether it's the Israelis or Hamas, do you think they care about whether we've got university students camped out or members of parliament offices being graffitied? It's of great frustration. Most people in this place know that I'm very close to the Palestinians. I've spent time in the West Bank, and I know a lot of Australian Palestinians as well. The level of this debate in this country is not helping them, and I think it's certainly not helping Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But my main reason for standing this evening is the level of debate in this parliament. Someone asked me recently, 'What's it like in parliament?' I said that, in recent years, it's been a bit like witnessing a high-school debating club, where you don't really have to back up what you're saying with facts and figures; it's more about your feelings, your passion, without any real responsibility for achieving what you're talking about. I'll give you a few examples. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Greens and the teals had a motion to ban fossil fuels, coal and gas. It was mainly gas that they were concerned about. These people live in the parts of Australia that would have more reliance on fossil fuel than anywhere else. Your technology, your everyday equipment—there's not one thing that we use at this moment that does not require fossil fuels. Take this wooden lectern. How do you build that without a saw that's made out of metal? Everything we have has an element of fossil fuels. And yet we've got members of parliament, who are supposedly highly intelligent, successful people, basically arguing to bring this country into poverty. It's incredibly frustrating. The teals were so concerned about gas that they hired a helicopter with two motors—one wouldn't have done—to fly around my electorate to look at the sites of coal seam gas to show their disgust at the gas industry, and they burnt massive amounts of fossil fuel while doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a bit of a theme that comes through different things, where members of parliament, in order to show their virtue to their electorates, are basically expecting my constituents to change what they're doing. The energy debate is a great one. We're not seeing any changes to behaviour with regard to the use of energy or the generation of energy in the capital cities, but there's an expectation that, in my part of the world, we're going to see a massive rollout of solar, wind and the accompanying transmission towers. My electorate has led the way. Dubbo has the highest uptake of individual rooftop solar of any town in Australia. I was involved in some of the early large-scale solar plants, at Nyngan, Broken Hill, Moree. We're leading the way, yet there is always the expectation that regional Australians will do more and more to make the wealthy people in the cities feel better about themselves. There is never any change there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're talking about climate change and reducing our emissions, one of the greatest projects to have environmental benefit but also economic benefit is the Inland Rail. One train, I think, takes 150 trucks off the Newell Highway, along with the associated fuel used, carbon emissions and all of that. The first thing this government did was scale back the rollout of Inland Rail, with no activity north of Narromine, where the tracks stopped. As a result, we're seeing the disadvantage starting to roll through, with contractors in Moree, Narrabri and Narromine who had invested money to upgrade their equipment now finding that they're in liquidation because the project has stopped. I'm a firm believer that this project will need to go ahead. It's a game changer for this country. But this government has pulled the funds. Once again, the people in the bush pay the price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Murray-Darling Basin, I've heard numerous speeches in this place about making sure we never have the rivers run dry again. Newsflash, folks: the northern Murray-Darling Basin is an ephemeral system. It has flooded and gone dry since time began. The idea that some sort of legislation that is enacted from this building in Canberra is going to change that is a vanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing is water being indiscriminately brought out of the consumptive pool as part of the 450 gigalitres, which was not part of the plan. It was an election ploy back in the Gillard era for South Australians in Adelaide. This water that's been purchased in the northern basin can't be delivered. Do people not know that the Gwydir is a terminal stream—that it doesn't connect through? If you wanted to get a megalitre of water, say, from Dubbo through the Macquarie Marshes up to the Barwon, down the Darling, through the lakes, down to the Murray and down to Adelaide—which, by the way, is not in the Murray-Darling Basin—it is nearly an impossibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing is that we're impacting the financial viability of my communities for something that has no actual, positive impact for anyone, but it's selling the story. We've seen those ridiculous ads on TV, where we've got coastal rivers and citrus orchards from Turkey and all sorts of things, pretending that could be the Murray-Darling Basin. It's an absolute nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one that's been incredibly divisive and very hurtful for my electorate was the debate around the Voice. My electorate voted 80 per cent against the Voice, and, you've got to remember, I represent the second-highest percentage of Aboriginal people of any seat in this place. So my Aboriginal constituents clearly did not want this Voice. But, in the parliament, we heard these virtuous speeches where, basically, I was accused of being some sort of racist by people who would not know one Aboriginal person on a personal level. It was a philosophical, feel-good argument but absolutely clueless about the people that it was supposed to impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aboriginal people in my electorate are people. They've got the same issues as everyone else. They want to educate their kids. They want to be able to get health care when they need it. They need a road to drive on. They need to be able to buy groceries that they can afford—all the things that everyone else does. Yet we had this ridiculous, divisive, $450 million debate that not only divided Australia but was very offensive to the people that I represent from western New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a responsibility in this place to actually back up what we're saying with some form of fact and reason, not to just signal how you feel about things because of your virtuous nature. We are more than that and we should start acting like it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  This month, July, is Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Month, and today I want to tell about my own very recent and real journey, about my large oral tumour, which, thankfully, was discovered and surgically removed. We all lead busy lives. But there is never a better time than this month, during Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Month, to have a check-up with your dentist and health practitioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, that started at a general check-up with my local dentist, who found something odd growing from the left-hand side of the roof of my mouth. I did not really understand what that was or could mean, and, I am sad to say, I continued my busy life. However, my dentist persisted and made sure I was booked in locally to see a head and neck specialist that visits Nowra each month. The truth is, I was still in denial. I was fit, healthy, a wife, a mum of four and an MP. But, as I learnt from the head and neck surgeon, I had a large oral tumour in my mouth. I was just stunned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality set in just before Easter 2024. I quietly scolded myself for not knowing what was going on in my own mouth and that it had been growing slowly in my mouth for some time. I was not in physical pain, but every single time I talked my tongue hit the tumour. The tumour was the new roof of my mouth, hidden quietly from public view, just behind my front teeth and my smile; no-one would ever know. The previous radio ads where I'd had trouble pronouncing some simple words, all of a sudden made sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although my family and close friends and colleagues knew, it was not something I could tell people. It was something that I was living with each and every day; it was playing on my mind. I was told that, regardless of whether the tumour was benign or something more sinister, it would need to be removed, and, although my tests were as good as they could be, there was still a chance the tumour was cancerous. For me, just getting to surgery was a major battle. I thank my staff, who had my back the entire time. Even going to hospital on the day of surgery, I was anxious to the point of not feeling well. I feared being sent home. But, thankfully, the surgery happened, the tumour was removed, and the surgery was a success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was when I was getting a dental obturator—which is a specially made, 3D printed dental prosthesis—fitted, to cover the roof of my mouth while it healed, that I learnt about the amazing technological advances in facial reconstruction following tumour removal for cancer. Our amazing Medicare system of course covers the removal of oral tumours in hospital, but, if your tumour removal means cutting into your jaw, nose or face, Medicare does not cover the reconstruction, so you might not be able to do simple and very necessary functions like eating and speaking. If you have breast cancer or prostate cancer, Medicare does cover the cost of a reconstruction, which is great, but, if you have head and neck cancer, Medicare does not cover a reconstruction with technology available. My grievance is that this needs to change. I was lucky to learn, a week or so later, that my tumour was benign. But it would have turned cancerous if not removed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Community Affairs References Committee last month handed down its recommendations on the inquiry into equitable access to diagnosis and treatment for individuals with rare and less common cancers. I particularly note recommendation 14. It recommends:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… that the Australian Government work with state and territory governments to identify the barriers faced by cancer patients requiring rehabilitation, prosthetics and implants as a result of their treatment, with a view to ensuring they have financial support for those services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I lend my support to that recommendation because head and neck cancer patients should be able to have access to reconstruction surgery to ensure an adequate quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely thank my dentist, surgeon and health practitioners and all who work in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery and treatment. Thank you for your dedication to a better way of life for tumour and cancer patients. This month, I encourage people to have that oral check—have that regular health check. It could just save your life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Issues close to the hearts of many people in my electorate of Gilmore are access to a bulk-billing GP and the cost of medicines. That's why I was thrilled to learn today that more GPs are bulk-billing patients in Gilmore as a direct result of the Albanese government's tripling of the bulk-billing incentive, with more than two million additional bulk-billed visits across the country since 1 November 2023. In the month before the bulk-billing incentive was tripled on 1 November 2023, 78.4 per cent of all GP visits were bulk-billed in Gilmore. Over the next seven months, the bulk-billing rate increased by 5.7 percentage points to 84.1 per cent in May. Gilmore residents have also saved $2,056,110 on the cost of their medicines thanks to the Albanese government's cheaper medicines policies, including our landmark 60-day prescription reforms and the largest cut to the maximum patient co-payment in the 75-year history of the PBS. Almost 50,000 60-day scripts were filled in Gilmore to May 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, the Albanese government also delivered the second-largest increase to Medicare rebates in 30 years, with $900 million in additional Medicare funding. This came on top of the $940 million delivered last year in the largest increase in 30 years. This means that, in just two years, the Albanese government has increased Medicare rebates by twice as much as the former government did in their nine years in office. Seven months of official Medicare billing data shows that, after a decade of cuts and neglect from the Liberals, the slide in the GP bulk-billing rate has stopped, and bulk-billing rates continue to improve each month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationally the GP bulk-billing rate was 79 per cent in May, a rise of 3.4 per cent since the higher bulk-billing incentives came into effect on 1 November. Australians living in regional and rural areas like mine have seen the biggest increases, with an estimated additional 900,000 bulk-billed visits since the higher bulk-billing incentives came into effect. Thanks to the Albanese government there is more bulk-billing in Gilmore. Doctor's groups have called our tripling of the bulk-billing incentive a game changer, and clearly it is in Gilmore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of cuts and neglect to Medicare by the Liberals, bulk-billing was in freefall. The pressure on general practice began when the opposition leader was health minister and tried to do away with bulk-billing, by introducing a fee on every single visit to the GP, and then he started a six-year freeze on Medicare rebates. The Albanese government committed to making it easier for people to see a bulk-billing doctor, and that is exactly what is happening right around the country, particularly in rural and regional Australia. This is a win all round for patients, doctors and the health system, and it is helping make Medicare stronger. People in Gilmore know that after a decade of cuts it was increasingly hard to find a bulk-billing doctor. Thanks to the Albanese government, there is more bulk-billing in our region, which is delivering significant cost-of-living relief for local people. Labor introduced Medicare, and only Labor can be trusted to strengthen and protect it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know people are doing it tough, and that's why we are delivering for every Australian. From 1 July, every Australian taxpayer gets a tax cut, not just some. Sixty-four thousand taxpayers in Gilmore get a tax cut, and 56,000 taxpayers in Gilmore now get a bigger tax cut than under the previous Liberal government's plan. Our $300 energy bill relief is beginning to flow, and 2.6 million low-paid workers getting their third consecutive pay rise, backed by this government. We're providing cost-of-living support while putting downward pressure on inflation. We're providing stronger Medicare, cheaper medicines, HECS relief for everyone with a student debt, more homes built more quickly, cheaper groceries by strengthening the food and grocery code, cost-of-living relief without adding to inflation, and a future made in Australia. There's more to do, and I'll keep working hard every single day to deliver for everyone in Gilmore.</span>
